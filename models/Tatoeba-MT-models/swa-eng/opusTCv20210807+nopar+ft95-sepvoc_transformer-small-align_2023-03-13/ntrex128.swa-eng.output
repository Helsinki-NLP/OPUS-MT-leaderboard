The Welsh Council delegates are concerned about 'appearing like puppets'
There is concern among some delegates after the proposal that their position should be changed to MWP (The Welsh Parliament's messenger).
This is due to a plan to convert the council's name into the Welsh Parliament.
Council delegates from all political units are concerned that the move will cause irony.
A Leba delegate said that his group was concerned that the name "like Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the Lutheran ttp means stupid and pwp means feces.
Plaid's delegate said that the group is generally "not pleased" and has proposed an alternative name.
The conservativeist delegate said his group was "open in thought" about the changing of the name, but he said they were MWP's short words to the puppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Lutheran is pronounced the same as the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Council's club, which currently creates a law to establish a name change, said: "The final decision on any basic word regarding how the Council delegates are referred to will certainly belong to the delegates themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act paid the Welsh council the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published a result of negotiations with the public on proposals that were widely supported by referring to the council as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the rank of Council delegates, Jopo preferred the delegates of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's choice received more support in consultation with the public.
As seen, Council delegates recommend an alternative option, but efforts to reach a consensus can be a challenge to the Executive Officer, Elin Jones, aubye is expected to submit a law draft on change after a few weeks.
The law on change will include other changes on how the council works, including laws to eliminate the merit of the Council Commissioner and the structure of the committee system.
Council delegates will vote the final vote about the name they will be called when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide if they change the name of the country into "North Macedonia's Republic."
This famous vote was planned to resolve a conflict that has existed with a decade and neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The authorities in Athens insist that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a claim for their territory and has continued to oppose its request to become a member of the European Union and the NATO Union.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a direct poll opponent about changing the name, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the move to change the name is needed so they can join the European Union and the NATO Union.
St. Martin Gos Silent as Churches in Harlem Passing Chagamoto
"History, the elders with whom I have thought say there was a church and a bar in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, no one."
He said the absence of bars is something that can be understood.
"People wander differently" nowadays, he said.
"Baa has hesitated to be like a neighbor's living room where people meet regularly."
For the churches, he is concerned that the money available from selling property will not last as leaders expect it too, "and soon they will return to their original state."
The churches, he added, may be converted into large rugbys with private-owned homes who will not help care for the remaining reserves in neighboring areas.
"A large number of people who buy private homes in these units will be white," he said, "and so this will make these churches closed in general because there is no possibility that people in these maghorofas will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white allies before Harlem became a city of blacks - City Community in 1870 and called St. Martin a decade later.
The white Mexican members left the 1930s.
The black members who were participating in the nearby area took up the units.
St. Martin became under black allies under vicar John Howard Johnson, who led a reja strike in 125th Street, the main neighborhood for purchase in Harlem, who refused to hire or associate with black people.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the members in the priest Johnson church when they set up plans to rebuild it, they issued the authority for the establishment of a set of bells played using keyboard or automatic method.
Priest David Johnson, son of vicar Johnson and successor of St. Martin, called a set of bells "the poor."
An expert who played a bell set in July called it another name: "The cultural crisis" and "a historical unchangeable historical issue."
An expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also recognized that it was the first set of bells in the world that was played by black musician, Dionio A. Lind, who moved to the largest set area in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek someone else to take over.
The bells played in St. Martin over the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a complicated way, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others were brought by the Archdiocese of the Bishops.
The administrative body in the parish, which includes church administrators - wrote a diocese in July concerned that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some allies complained of the lack of transparency from the diocese.
The pope injures a 13-year-old child while diving to trap a rope-tree in Califonia
The pope attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to trap a rope-tree in Carlifonia on the first day of the string-tree season, officials said.
The invasion occurred shortly before 1 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV television in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a young man screams calling for assistance and then rowing with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that the first time he thought it was just excited to trap a rope-tree, but "I found that he was screaming, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His shoulder arm had come out," Hammel said he discovered it after he approached a boy.
"I shouted for everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
A boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The shark species who made an invasion is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a press session that the pope had appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but it was defined as not a species of dangerous sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of his body.
Officials closed the beach access from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury wants to fight Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using beauty styles with employees who are assistant professionals.
As a large part of planning to enter the £ 2.8 billion beauty market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow as the sales of fashion and household equipment decline, large rows of beauty will be tested in 11 stores across the country and established in more stores next year if this move is successful.
Investment in beauty has come as supermarkets seek ways to fill the shelf spaces that were used to keep television, microves and household equipment.
Sainsbury said it would double the production of beauty products to 3,000, including editions such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing editions from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with the designated sites similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This large store also re-opens the store of various cosmetics products so that many of the goods will die of meat - something that is heavily pressured by young buyers.
In addition, retail perfume dealer Fragance Shop will experiment at two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the privileges of purchase of daily food products at a small amount in a nearby retail store means supermarkets are forced to make more effort to lure people to visit.
Mike Coupu, the main executive in Sainsbury, has said that the store will have more appearance like the units store while the pick of supermarkets trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has been starting small Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also established some Habitats stores from the time it bought the two-year picks, which says it has increased vegetable sales and made customers more useful.
The original attempt of the large store to revive its beauty and medicine units failed.
Sainsbury tested a joint project with Boots in the early 2000s, but the coalition broke after a dispute emerged about how to share revenue from the pharmaceutical stores located in its supermarkets.
A new technique was introduced after Sainsbury sold his 281 store drug industry to Celestio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £25 million, three years ago.
Lloyds are said to be responsible for the plan, by adding more high-profile features of facial care and skin including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and condition of our beauty products to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also placed in professional workers who will be available to provide advice.
Our editions are designed to meet all the needs and attractive environments and the ideal location means that we have now been an exciting place of beauty products where it offers great competition in the original ways of shopping."
Peter Jones's 'a riot' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £1 million business deal
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones was left as a 'season' after television broadcaster Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £1 million news program and his lifestyle brand business to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has little time for their Truly brand of household products and spares.
The two trade was connected to the Goop edition owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning, wrote in Instagram to announce that he is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star" Den Peter Jones with a spell by withdrawing from their grand news of the fashion brand of life-time styles last minute - to consider his new grand contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
News sources say Jones "was upset" when the popular girl in television admitted at a very nervous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business plans - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that he would not have enough time to handle their brand of household equipment and Truly spares.
The business had been compared to the Goop edition owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to increase Willoughby's double wealth estimated at £1 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, wrote in Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly's business, Jones left England by plane to one of his vacation homes.
The source of the news said: "Truly was among the things Holly considered more.
It was to be his permanent approval that would enable him to continue for more than decades to come.
His decision to withdraw was quite surprising to everyone involved.
No one believed what was going on Tuesday, the launch time was very close.
There are warehouses full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this publisher of This Morning, all of whom can be trusted most in England, can cost the business millions of money from large investment in products including rivers, candles, clothing and household equipment and possible delays of the launch.
And it can indicate the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and you are born Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple go on vacation with Jones who owns 40% at Baldwin's Ringa factory.
Willoughby is expected to be the ambassador to the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to I'm A Celebrity.
The source of news near Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his controversial activities."
A firm talk 'and then we loved each other'
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news agencies by commenting that others would consider "unfited president" and in praising North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump more disappointed?
Trump said in his ridiculous voice "Reporter".
"I haven't given up for anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapuri in June to be praised by Trump as a major step in removing nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations have been stuck.
Over three months after a meeting in June in Singapuri, North Korean famous ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North Korean nation has not seen "a corresponding step" from the United States for the early stages of removing North Korea.
Instead, he said, Marekena has continued obstacles that focus on increasing pressure.
Trump had a hopeful attitude in his speech a public meeting.
"We're going on well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions would lose their lives.
Now we've started a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve collaboration with Kim have brought good results - to stop rocket tests, to help in the release of hostages and help in the return of the homes of American troops.
And he defended his unusual way of discussing her relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to enter this crowded field, we would have 200 people standing there," Trump said, stretching the finger to the crowd ahead of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Indonesia Bring Great Damage on Island, Killing Hundreds of People
After an earthquake on Lombok island, for example, non-governmental organizations were told that they were unnecessary.
Even though more than 10% of the Lombok people had been evacuated, no national disaster was announced, it must be necessary to stimulate international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, and that brings challenges". Mrs. Jupiter said.
With Save the Children scoring together the team to travel to Palu, you are not sure if foreign workers can work between the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see it for international organizations would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Due to frequent land vibrations that occur in Indonesia, hio has remained in a state of poor order due to natural disasters.
Although residential shelters due to tsunami effects have been built in Aceh, they are not widely available in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning was there, may have contributed to disaster.
In the best case, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural lights perform complicated transport operations.
The hospital ship set in Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims is likely to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Wido used the infrastructure that captured in Indonesia as the core of your elected campaigns, and has spent a lot of money on road construction and rail.
But financial deficit has been a challenge to Mr. Joko's government as he approaches elections next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from the sekta groups, where many Muslim allies have had conservative faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and dozens of dead people were evacuated into their homes when Christian and Muslim factions fought in the streets, by beating swords, bows and arrows and other fierce weapons.

The ball flew over the defence area and headed for the top right corner of the net.
The ball then passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who had jumped and ended up in the net.
"It was just trying to be in a hio position, to reach the ball and players like Shaq all the time they play the ball forward as they could, so I tried to create myself as long as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I took one touch and I didn't even think too much about it and just hit a button."
Chelsea led 1–0 during the break after closing the goal 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.

Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to happen.
Investigation president Brian O'Hagan said: 'An investigation is in the first stages but I would appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything he questioned to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything with their car cameras to contact us because they may have an explanation that is important to investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was in the building.
This day friends who believe they know a woman have reached the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police have said they are in the process of informing the family members of the auction.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has now tried to enter his house but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He had no speech when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it can take several hours before it is allowed to enter the building.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes a recent reminder to face the 'written history crisis'
His removal will be a right to its equivalent of Taliban's destruction for the art of many religious and British certifications carried out by its strong members of the Puritan wing.
But the Cromwell Community described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a search" and "will answer re-written history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "It would not be inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of the statue as a model of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying images in the civil war in England was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst Cromwell would be blamed for was the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the past century.
Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive representation to Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's views and part of the history of the person who many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is honored by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary advocate due to external pressure, a situation for which he was the source of royal leadership.
Whether all of this is a correct representation in the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is evident is that the mid- 17th century war has laid the basis for the future development of our country and Cromwell is a private person who is recognized to represent one wing in the opposing groups.
His success as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and celebrated."
Pig Killer Amng'ata and Kills Chinese Farmer
The farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in the market in southwestern China, according to media reports in the area.
The man, identified by the last name of "Yuan," was found dead with a badly affected vein with blood spill near a pig shed in the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to give them a pig vaccine in a pig room on 20 May 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door of a neighboring pig shed was open.
He said that in a pig shed there was a male pig with blood in his mouth.
The study confirmed that the £ 550 heavy pig had been gone and killed the farmer, according to reports.
"My cousin's feet were blood and broken," cousin, referred to by his first name as "Wu," he said, how quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Videos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been tied away to prevent him from wearing someone else, while police collected evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market brokers are reportedly discussing his death compensation.
Although less frequent, the conditions of pigs have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man and serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a £650 -weight pig pushed a Palestinian farmer against her tractor until her mistress shocked her and escaped.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but if they taste blood could be "laughing."
"They're just playing.
They smell, and those who want to know ... they don't intend to injure you.
You should just respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa remains bring heavy rains across the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to deteriorate as it passes over the water we are more still on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, hurricane Rosa will bring flood rains across northern Mexico and southwestern United States for a few days to come.
Hurricane Rosa was a 85 mph wind, Type 1st Hurricane, at 11 a.m. East hours on Sunday, and appeared 385 miles southwestern Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the atmosphere has begun to shake itself over the Pacific Ocean and head east to the Western Coast of the United States. With the hurricane Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin pushing tropical moisture to the north in the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, tropical moisture that begins to interfere with the surrounding atmosphere will cause a lot of rain in the west in the future.
In the interior, rain of 1 to 4 countries will cause sudden deadly flooding, mud slope and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Much tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to 2 to 3 inches per hour in one place, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be the rainfall rates of 2 to 4 inches in the southwestern parts, especially many Arizona areas.
Sudden flooding can result from developing conditions because of the state of tropical rain.
It will be very dangerous to go out of the desert by foot from the risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause the collaps into large rivers and thunders will bring strong winds and scattered dust.
The surrounding atmosphere will bring abundant rainfall to some of the South California coasts.
The total rainfall rates of more than half a country may occur, which can cause a small slope of mud and skiing roads.
This will be the first rain in the area in the rainy season.
Some of the sprays of tropical rain will begin towards Arizona later on Sunday and Monday as abstinent, before the rain spreads further later Monday and Tuesday.
Much of the rain will spread in Four Horns on Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October it may have a high temperature change throughout the United States with the heat of the Akiki decline, but the tropical regions will remain at average temperature.
Sometimes this causes sudden temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of sudden diversity in temperatures across the United States on Sunday.
There is about about a 20-speed temperature difference between Kansas Town, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the near summer will try to get rid of itself and spread again.
Many central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to be warm at the beginning of October and the spread of 80 degrees from the South Plains to the Northwestern regions.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be 10 degrees than average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high risk of average temperatures in eastern United States to half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh case
Over 20 million people watched a major witness on Thursday and the selection of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who is shocked for sexual abuse that is said to occur in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, in six television stations.
Meanwhile, political conflict continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular periods to highlight the final stage of Friday events: a deal implemented by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate for a week on charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he is 100% sure that Kavanaugh held him secret while he was drunk and tried to strip off clothes at a high school ceremony.
Kavanaugh, giving emotional testimony, said he is 100% sure that this did not happen.
There is a possibility that over 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company was counting average viewing at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Statistics were not immediately available from other networks that waved, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's organization usually has a challenge to count people who look at as afini.
To put this in a positive perspective, hio is a audience equal to the audience of the professional football game or Studies College Awards.
Fox News, whose comment directors have been strongly supported by Kavanaugh's selection, led all networks on an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second and 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The desire remained high after the trial.
Flake was the main theme in Friday's hio case.
After this average citizen official reported that he would be supporting the appointment of Kavanaugh, he was trapped by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being picked up by the experts as he tried to ride the elevator to attend the Court Committee case.
He stood down for several minutes while being reprimanded, an event shown directly at CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "you are strong when many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had released information and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have much to say in the committee case.
The broadcasting and cable networks were all directly lighting several hours later, while the Court Committee was voting to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do so with insight that the FBI could investigate claims against the selection in the next week, which the few Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was somewhat convinced by a conversation with his friend, the Democratic Senator. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was strong, because it was clear that the Crepublicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation through the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has threatened opponents for 'playing politics' about Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May threatened opponents of his plan to withdraw from the European Union for "playing politics" and British agent and humiliate national interests in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attacks on his plan known as Chequers for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect each other's tribute is "a mere nonsense."
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned at the second rate of murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a battle video between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the war.
Police obtained glasses from the attack area and said they found Simpson's DNA on glasses, WAFB, a CBS partner, said.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His covers are set as $350,000, Attorney reported.
Afisi East Baton Rouge's death investigator released an earlier report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a shooting injury on the head inside the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police panel, a police criminal laboratory, Southern University police police and local citizens for assisting in an investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU director Joe Alleva thanked the local law mother for "a necessity and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-foot player was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He received an average of 5.6 and 2.6 points in the balling in the game last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade basketball team said the team was "very affected" and "screamed" by the death of Wayde.
"The things like these are the ones that worry at all," said Wade.
Volcano throws ashes on Mexico City
The skulls aired from Popocatepetl volcano have reached the neighbouring areas of the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Manga Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after operations increased within the crater and recorded 183 times of gas production and ash for over 24 hours.
The station was tracking many roars and vibrations.
Photos on social media showed thin ash ash covering car mirrors in neighboring areas of Mexico such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in volcanic activity that is located 45 miles ( 720 km) south-east of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police fight the Catalans to withdraw before the anniversary of freedom of voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters fought against protest police while thousands joined the anti-profile protests to commemorate the first year of Katalunya's withdrawal vote.
A group of protesters wearing pro-specific puppets detained by police beat them with eggs and threw them into flour, resulting in black clouds of dust in the streets that would usually have many tourists.
Riots also occurred later that day with police using their rods to face fighting.
For more than several hours supporting the isolation groups saying "No forget, no pardon" faced the united protesters who were saying, "Uhispiania always."
fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries found in protests, local media reported.
The concern remains high in the area that prefers to gain independence a year after a 1 October referendum considered illegal by authorities in Madrid but celebrated by the pro-Conservatives.
Voters chose largely to get free, although the number of people who appeared to be low while those who oppose isolation ignore voting in large quantities.
According to the Catalan authorities about 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the area and cause violent violence.
Groups of freedom supporters had camped all night on Friday to prevent protests to help national police.
The march continued but had to take a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, a electric technician who attended a isolation protest with his wife said he was no longer optimistic of Katalunya's expectations to gain independence.
"Last year we lived in the best period of life.
I looked at my parents crying happily for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite winning a significant victory although very small in the previous regional election in December, the parties supporting Catalan independence have failed to maintain speed in this year with many known leaders being exiled for selfish or detention awaiting trial for providing a referendum and a later report of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car technician recording protests supporting police on his phone, said that the conflict had been caused by politicians from both units.
"The concerns continue to grow further," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced that he would hold a seat in the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European Parliament election is the best way to refuse to be restored to democratic values and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's Bao gives Livingston a 1–0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first Goli to Livingston ensured victory
The promoted Livingston surprised Rangers for causing Steven Gerrard's defeat for the second time in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's rugby was the one that separated the results between both teams with Gary Holt's team moving and holding second place similar to Hibernian.
The Gerrard team remains unsuccessful in foreign matches in the Premier League this season and will face leaders Hearts, who are ahead of them with eight points, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers will be a native of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased the number of matches that have not failed to be six in the bridge, where the main coach Holt has not yet failed since taking the position of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lacks space against non-violent guests
Holt's team had to be ahead long before closing, with their direct attack game causing Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson was able to get a chance but missed the target for her mkwaju passed in front of the goli, then Alan Lithgow could only hit the ball out after she slipped to meet the head ball from Craig Halkett.
The locals were not seen by anxiety and allowed Rangers to take possession of the game, knowing that they could trouble visitors with the use of the bar.
And it's in this way that they were able to tie the goal.
Rangers were punished with a rugby and Livingston struggled to find a gap, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined and gave Menga a chance, who touched and scored a score from the middle of the box.
At that time, Rangers had controlled the possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home team's defence for the home team and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was not troubled for a long period of game,
The style continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his rugby.
Scott Pittman was prevented from tying the score and legs of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow ran the ball out after another Livingston club game.
The attacks continued to search for the Livingston team's box and continued to be removed, while two claims of penalti - after Halkett dropped the reserve player Glenn Middleton, and another about holding the ball with hands - was ignored.
''Ajabu' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC of Scotland at Tony Macaron
Good work and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had a better game and continue to exceed expectations and by continuing to climb up on the jersey.
Their style of playing with the team has not changed much since returning to the main league, but many compliments go to Holt in the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed to the main, holding well the best-organized defence fort, while Menga gave them operations every time Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
Rangers missed the motility, however.
As they have been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under those standards.
They missed the last touch at the gate - only once they were able to create a score in the home team's fort - and hio is a challenge for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the jersey.
Erdogan gets a different reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany - which aims to amend relations between the two NATO allies.
They have differed in issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkish reach to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a barrier to 25,000 crowds not to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters appeared in nearby areas to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - most of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, scoring Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The two-story protests indicate a division about the attitude of the president who appears to be a hero to some German Turks and was killed by others as a dictator.

Hurricane Rosa Risks Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Sudden Flood (The Summer Area Can Benefit)
It is not common for tropical pressure depression from Arizona, but that is exactly what can happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining powers will pass through the West Desert and cause the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Climate Service has already issued a warning of the sudden flooding of Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route on Phoenix on Tuesday and approach later Monday with rain.
The National Climate Service in Phoenix has described on Twitter that "10 tropical oaks have maintained storms and pressure shortages within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border."
Recent examples of Hurricane National Center predict the rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as a few levels of up to 6 inches at Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other Western Desert areas including the Great Basil Rockies are likely to obtain 1 to 2 inches and the possibility of getting a few levels of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the danger of sudden flooding, hurricane rains Rosa can be a blessing because the area is dry.
Although flooding is a source of great concern, some of these rains can be beneficial because the South West is witnessing dry conditions.
According to the U.S. Summer Track. More than 40% of Arizona is witnessing at least a severe drought, the second type," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's route leads to the ground through the Mexican Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning and a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is available 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heads north for 12 km per hour.
Storms are confronted with water in the Pacific and therefore its power is declining.
Thus, it is expected to reach the ground in Mexico with the power of tropical storms day or Monday evening.
Rain in some parts of Mexico can be high and cause serious flooding risk.
"The 3 to 6th-century rain is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest and the possibility of reaching 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the morning on Tuesday as a depression of tropical pressure and then heading up through Arizona and south of Utah Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from hurricane Rosa or its remains is a heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Northern Desert of Sonora and the United States. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
Rain is expected to cause sudden flooding of life and mud slope on deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.

Trump says Kavanaugh 'showed, selfishness and anger' of the Wademokrats
"The visit of Justice Kavanaugh is a vote of rejecting the brutal and terrifying tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling meeting, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been shown the selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his entire selection process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Parliament on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused him decades ago when they were young.
Ford also witnessed in a case about the woman's claims.
President said Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to prove Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the most complete intelligence of our times, a lawyer with a good service record for the public," he told the West Virginia crowd.
The President referred to the election of Kavanaugh in an indirect way when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters to come out to vote in the election of representatives.
"Five weeks from now one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't fight, but in another perspective I'm running for the truth," he said.
"That's why I'm going around everywhere to strike the good debe candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
The first important vote of order at the Senati parliament on the Kavanaugh selection is expected to take place before Friday, the chief assistant of the GOP leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and the death toll
At least 384 people were killed, many were asked when large waves arrived in fukwe, when a massive earthquake and tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for festivals on the coast in the city of Palu on Friday when six-metre waves (18 ft) struck land at night and struck many and destroyed and destroyed and destroyed everything that existed.
Tsunami followed a 7.5-larged earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still working on the coast and did not run immediately and became affected," Sutopo Purwo Nug Spirit, a spokesman for Indonesia BNPB said at a meeting with reporters in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, came with cars, logs, houses, affecting everything on the ground," said Nugspirit, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Some people planted trees to avoid tsunamis and rescuers, he said.
About 16,,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in Palau.
Space images released by the disaster agency showed many damaged buildings and stores, bridges were overthrown and sank by a water - surrounded mosque.
Small vibrations continued to be heard in the coastal town Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was heard in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Tathmini and Technology Use (BPPT) said in a report that energy released by a large Friday earthquake was about 200 times as much as the atomic bomb bombed Hiroshima in the Second World War.
City Geography, which is found at the end of a thin strip may have caused a tsunami increase, said.
Nug Spirit described the destructive situation as "pana" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. The bodies of some victims were found trapped in the rubble of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nug Spirit said the casualties and damage may be the largest along the coast of 300 miles (190 km) north of Plu, a region called Donggala , which is near the core of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely disabled without any information" from Donggala , Nugspirit said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that workers and volunteers were heading for affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it may be worse," he said.
The organization on Saturday was widely criticized for not declaring that tsunami had attacked Palu , although leaders said the waves arrived shortly after a warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared in social media, a man in the upper floor of the building can be heard shouting at tsunami warnings approaching to people on the road.
Within a few minutes water waves reach the coast and carry buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately confirm this video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the loss of electricity in the broad area that interrupted contact near Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending freight aircraft and aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced still need food and other basic needs.
The town airport has only been opened for relief efforts and will remain locked up until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue stations in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Dead From Indonesia's Tsunami Increases over 800.
The Situation Is So Bad.
With World Vision staff from Donggala safe success in the town of Plu, where workers are defending themselves in tents placed outside their office, they went through events of massive destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many damaged houses" he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though assistance groups began relief operations, some complained that foreign workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling Plu.
According to Indonesia's laws, money, equipment and foreign workers can only begin to enter if disaster declares national.
This has not yet been done.
"It is still a county standard disaster," said Alia Arrian, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government has said, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open up to get international help but there is still no such situation."
The second night was struck by Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who were lost were hoping that their loved ones will find and make it a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was found from the sewage pipeline.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been in need of rubble for two days and her mother’s body near her.
Gendon Subandono , coach of the national flight team of Iindonesian umbrella, had taught two of the umbrella players who have been lost for Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, together with Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the field of the umbrella jump, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, hours after a report about Roa Roa Hotel spread between the community of participants in the umbrella jump game, had sent WhatsApp's message to Palu competitors, who were participating in the coastal concert.
Its message, however, showed one grey mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the message was not read," he said.

Kanye West: A search artist changes his name to Ye
The bomber Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been named Ye's nickname for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
These changes occur before his appearance in the Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on a period who felt regret for "a emotional reason ," the show producer said.
Despite being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that the term has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is a widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking about the name of his album and radio producer Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means a special person, and only being Ye - to be an example of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more like what we are."
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their names
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his privileges by names Love and Brothers Love.
Former West member, JAY-Z, has also had to use his name with a lower or not having a large letter.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never promised to use the military against civilians while the country is about to mark 50 years since the bloody murder against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will not use the army to deal with the Mexicans."
The troops shot in peace demonstrations in the building on 2 October, 1968, and killed about 300 people while the left-wing student movement was deeply rooted in South America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grant to students and opening unpaid public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double A.I's scholarship.
While China continues to be more involved in the mind of the beans, the United States should double the amount of money it uses in research in the field hio, said AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various U.S. government units broadcast on AI, even though the United States generally lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: and intends to be number 1 in AI's discovery by 2030.
"To double the AI budget will be a good start, due to the situation that all other countries are behind the United States and we seek new discoveries in AI," Lee said.
Adding double money can double the opportunity that the next AI success will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has placed in one of the most popular AI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University created an AI system that won the Othello player of the U.S. top grade and later became active in Microsoft Research and president of Google branch of China.
Lee agreed that the American government technology competition as a Roboti Association in the Plans for the Deep Defence Research and requested to know when another race would be, to help identify the experts in the field.
Researchers in the United States often have to do extra work to obtain government aid, Lee said.
"Not China takes professional leaders, it's companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think green cards should be released directly to PhD students in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Committee issued its Development Program in False Mind in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Science of China offers money to people in educational institutions similar to how the dedication of Natural Science and other government agencies offers funds to American researchers, but the quality of professional work is of low level in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Cooperation Center in False Mind, which aims to associate partners from the sector and scholars and White House announced the creation of the Study Committee in False Mind.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently offers over $100 million dollars annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that wanted to form the National Security Commission in False Mind has not advanced for months now.
Macedonian voters on the change of the name of the country
The Macedonians voted on Sunday about the change of his name as "North Makedon's Republic," a move that could resolve a conflict of many years with Greece that prohibits its membership request in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a claim to its province and has opposed the country's request to become a member of NATO and EU.
The two governments reached a consensus in June according to the new proposed name, but national opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic awareness of many Syllon people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the campaign to ignore voting has caused doubts about whether the number of voters will reach the 50% required by the referendum to be correct.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership and accept an agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a suitable bail to be paid to be accepted into organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created from the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians so they can live freely under the European Union umbrella because the move means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska as Skopje.
Although not legally recognized, sufficient members of parliament have said they will support the vote results to make them more serious.
The change of the name will require support and two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's electoral commission has said there has not been any reports of violations of law by seven o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the number of voters was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary election in 2016 while 66% of registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski , 62, voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia to replace the country's name which will open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Prior to the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, was providing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents created by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We support NATO with the European Union, but we want to join willingly, not through the back door under pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We're a poor country, but we have our honour.
If they don't want to register us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia partnership."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the most needed investment to Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
"I believe a large number will support because 80% of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the proof of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum - under the required level .
Another study, conducted by the Macedonian Telma television television , found that 57% of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to follow the number of voters should be 50% and one vote.
Failure in the referendum will represent the first major blow to the Western-based government policy since it took the steering wheel last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City surrounds all Brighton fort and tying a score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling humiliated Brighton's guards in a match that Manchester City won 2–0 Saturday at the Etihad field in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem very easy when he scored a score in the 65th minute.
Argentina's attacker got iron in the middle of the field and started a series.
He passed between three Brighton bass, before penetrating into the open area.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed one bass and then accelerated the rest on the corner of the Brighton gate box.
He then struck the iron in his left side, and found Sterling.
The British attacker first used his touch in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg around Brighton Mathew Ryan's gatekeeper and mkwaju inside the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a score at that time."
But it is Sterling who gave the Sky Blues first control in the League League match.
The draw was closed in 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball within Brighton in the attack.
He ironed a good bow through the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched a few times before giving him a iron Sterling on the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues attacked the ball in the net before starting to celebrate.

Scherzer wants to be a Arab against. Rockies
With the Nationals already removed from the match, he had no other reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer who is highly competitive hopes to be a barrier on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a significant impact on Rockies, who are proud of having one game that has not played against Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockies won the chance to play the winning match by winning 5–2 against National on Friday night, but still seek the first crown in the bridge.
"Although we don't want to get anything, at least we can play a hard game with the situation it wants here Denver and the crowd and other teams will be playing at the highest level at every level I'll face this year .
Why don't I want to compete in that level?"
National has not yet announced players who will start the game on Sunday, but they say they have wanted to allow Scherzer to blow the ball in the situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, practiced a launch on Thursday and would be throwing on his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hand player has 18–7 and an average of 2.53 hits and 300 points to be removed by beating in 220 2/3 hits this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The President directly referred to the situation facing his selection Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he spoke of the importance of Republican sons to make a significant appearance in the election of representatives.
"All the results we got are at risk in November.
Five weeks from the most important elections in our lives.
These are one of the biggest, big elections -- I don't fight but in another view I really run and that's why I'm spinning around to beat good debe candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of the Wademokrats, you see what they do right now.
And they have decided to take power by using any possible means, you can see selfishness, corruption.
They don't care about people who hurt them, who are wrong to gain power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said, the Democratics are willing to "oppose and prevent."
"And you can see it in the past four days," he said, calling the Wademokrats to be people of "anger and selfish and perverse and liars."
He mentioned a member of the Senator Court Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which made the audience appear to him.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you expose a document in a wrong way?
Uh, uh, what it's.
No, not, I waited for one - that was the weakest language of the body - the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The Leba Party is no longer a church united.
It does not tolerate free ideas
While Momentum activists in my local party voted to remove me, it was not very strange.
After all, I am one of the Leba MPs' line told that we don't want to be met - all by saying our thoughts.
My partner in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he stood for his rebellion against the discrimination of the certifications.
In my case, the proposal to remove me was shocked by disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a proper economic policy, on national security, on the issue of Europe, the same is that these issues are similar to what Jeremy differs from the original leaders.
A report to Leba's meeting in East Nottingham on Friday explained that "we want meetings to be integrated and effective."
For over eight years as a local Leba MP, the GC Friday night meetings have been fully included.
Unfortunately today, it was not similar to many meetings and the political promise "low, generous" has long been forgotten if, indeed, it had begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not accepted in Leba and all views are taken well if only accepted by party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, like my partner whom I thought we were sharing the same political perspective began to expect me to change ideas completely and take the positions I would never agree with - whether it's about national security or one market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - the next is insulting in social media and efforts to want me not to be selected, reject middle-wing politics, and tell me that I shouldn't be in Leba.
And it's not the situation I've gone through alone.
Indeed, I know I'm more lucky than other colleagues because the views directed to me are political.
I have deep respect for the skills and statements of my colleagues who face sexual or racial insults every day but never give up.
One of the most disappointing things in modern politics is how the standards of abuse are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Leba should develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a church united and for every debate wla "untrust" or change in selection principles, the party becomes more narrow in integration.
I've got a lot of advice over the past two years being urged to settle down, I don't talk too much and that "I'll be right."
But I didn't enter politics to do so.
Since I joined the Leba 32 years ago as a school student, due to the incentive to be ignored by the Thatcher government which left my full school class about to fall, I have struggled to fight for better public services for those who need them most - whether it is a local councillor or government minister.
I have not hidden my kind of politics, including in the previous election.
No one in the East Nottingham could be confused about attitude in policy and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I will say is that when the country is about to leave the European Union almaraki Brexit, a move that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and strength to discuss my loyalty to the Leba party leader.
But really one of my messages is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to the citizens in my area, whether members of the Leba or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that there is no amount of threats to be removed or political prosperity will prevent me from considering what I believe is for the best interest for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr Team that is not yet to take the first place on the jersey
Two attempts in the last time may have changed to some extent the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr qualified to win in this most anticipated match of the Tennt League.
Now they lead the jersey, a special team that has not failed.
Eventually, it was their best defence , and such as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tried in our games so far, and we've not yet failed, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Hongera to Ayr, they used their best positions to be replaced."
Grant Anderson's attempt on the 14th minute, closed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish team player Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have many players and Jason Baggot got to close an attempt that was not closed.
Climo added Ayr's leadership to penalti, just before the break, scored and then completed the experiment alone and made the score 17–5 to Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, closed by Baggot, reduced leadership by five points.
The game was then suspended for a while after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed carried by the game when it was re-established, Ayr added his leadership to Stafford McDowall's attempt, closed by Climo.
Kaimi captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson then was given a yellow card and again, Melrose used the position to have one more player and closed it with Bruce Colvine's attempt , at the end of a radical period.
The home team took control again, however, while Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card by playing badly for Climo without ball and from the penalti line out, MacPherson scored due to a severe attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, how he was doing after the game began again, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's kkwa and pushed Gregor Henry and shut down the fifth attempt for the home team.
Still Game star takes a new job in the restaurant sector
The Still Game Ford Kieran star appears to enter the house sector after it was discovered to have been appointed as director of the certified restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star plays named Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, a writer and co-founder of his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the show and it seems Kiernan has another plan in life after Craiglang .
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun news claimed that Kiernan had expected to be involved in "a very growing restaurant business "in Glasgow."
''The sea is ours': Bolivia which has no port hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific sea
Marine patrols at sea headquarters at La Paz.
Public buildings have placed a blue flag like a sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are written: "The sea is ours just.
Bringing it back is a responsibility."
Throughout Bolivia without port, the memory of the coastal zone that lost to Chile in the 19th century resource crisis is still clear - just as a desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps that hope is currently the highest for many years, with Bolivia awaiting the decision of the international justice court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia is fast, a spirit of unity and quiet and really has a prospect of a positive attitude effectively," said Roberto Calzadilla , Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at ICJ's decision on a large screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will make a decision that accepts Bolivia's claims - after decades of appropriate conversation - Chile will be forced to discuss the move to give Bolivia the way to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president - who faces a fierce confrontation in re-election next year - also has much to do with Monday decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
But some critics believe that there is little possibility that the court will make the right decision for Bolivia - and that there will be very little changes even if it decides.
The Dutch-based organization has no authority to sell Chile to other countries, and has said that it cannot determine the outcome of the expected dialogue.
ICJ's decision will be made only six months after the final debate indicates that the case "not complicated," said Paz Zárate , Chilean expert in international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia's hopes, four years ago may have turned it back.
"The sea reach issue is exploited by the current Bolivian regime," said Zárate .
Morales' political words have ended the remaining good intentions of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue the discussion, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were very rapid.
Monday will give Bolivia "a remarkable event to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "stop 139 years of difference in common benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - is still one of the most famous presidents in South America - he was using the sea as a political stage.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we need to go ahead."
North Korea says that the elimination of nuclear weapons will not be possible unless it has confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation will never remove his nuclear weapons first if it cannot have confidence with Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called for the United States to follow the promises it made during a meeting in Singapuri among opposition leaders.
His comments come as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-establish nuclear diplomas that had not been successful for over three months after the Singapuri meeting with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "little" that promoting American sanctions and opposition to a report ending the Korean War will ever make North weak.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pyongyang first to make important measures to remove weapons.
Kim and US President Donald Trump all want a second meeting.
But there is great doubt that Pyongyang considers the action to remove the weapons the country considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to host Kim-Trump's second meeting.

Other large devices include ticket models, witch hat and even pineapples - but are not designed to give your head warm.
Thom Browne also exposed the strange deserts - at the time Halloween is approaching.
Most colored fields had lips made and identical to Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills

Fashion viewers predict that large boxets can be on the way to get to luxury stores near you.
The giant hat gives design in 'La Bomba', a straw hat with two-speed edges and leads everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.

Popular fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big caps and bag bags arriving in stores next summer - because the architect has brought a significant impact that would be difficult to ignore the needs of large materials.'
John Edward: Language knowledge is important to international citizens
Scottish independent schools continue to maintain a record of professional skills and this has continued in 2018 for another set of quality test results, which are strengthened by personal and collective success in sports, art, music and other social efforts.
Despite the increase in over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland (almaraki SCIS), are working to provide a better level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with more and higher education, the professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
As a education sector that can create and implement a special school course, we see modern languages continue to be popular and a preferred subject in school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language it goes to his heart."
This is a vital reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
Due to the recent results of this year's test, we can see that languages lead the league table with high ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68% of foreign - language students received a top sign of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72% of students received a top A mark in Kimandrin and 72% for those who learn German, 69% for those who study French and 63% of Spanish students also found A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge children and young people will need in their future.
Languages now, as a selection class, are taken to the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and elsewhere.
A study by the British Commission in Ajira and Master in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they had the challenge of filling out jobs, 17% was associated with lack of language knowledge .
So more and more, language knowledge becomes necessary to provide young people with their later professions.
With many jobs required language, this knowledge is essential in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned the second language, they will have a more real chance in the future to have such a knowledge of life.
Having the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will put someone speaking languages ahead in competition.
According to YouGov's study of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak foreign language well to promote dialogue in French which is the only language spoken by a percentage of two figures, 15%.
This is why investing in language training is now important for current children.
Having many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a good chance to get meaningful jobs.
Inside Scotland, each school will have a different language that teaches.
Several schools will focus on the most modern languages, where others will teach languages that seem to be the most important to Britain in the future to 2020, such as Kimandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be several options in independent schools, as well as training experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools offer to provide a learning environment that will provide children and give them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their later professions.
It cannot be challenged that at this time, in the state of international trade, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, so this should be shown in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "International knowledge of communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, unlike quality to the Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Board of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron playing his first game with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is about the end of fans eager to see LeBron James playing the first match as Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers Luke Walton coach has announced that James will play the pre-final match on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is still unclear how many minutes he will play.
"It would be more than a minute and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers writer Mike Trullell explained in tweet that James can play a few minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in the Lakers schedule of "six pre-final games.
"I don't need pre-final games at this point of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump Political Conference in West Virginia, YouTube Centre
Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign meetings this night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
You will be the first of five meetings that are scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote to prove whether it is still suspended about the one who appointed him to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support in the election as the Crepublicans are in danger of losing the control of Parliament while the votes will be cast in November.
How will Trump's meeting in West Virginia be and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 1 p.m. East Hours tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia online conference through a direct flow on YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss a case that will take place this week about the selection of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which has brought much concern about accusations of sexual abuse that led to a temporary suspension of the Senate evidence vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the goal of this meeting pick is to beat debe candidates of the Crepublicans in the November election to gain more popularity.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings in the next week aims to strengthen volunteers and supporters while the Crepublicans trying to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Senate control is important for his agenda so the president will travel in as many states as possible as we approach the most campaign season," spokesman for Trump's campaign committee who refused to be recognized told Reuters.
Planned at Wesbanco's field in Wheeling, this night meeting can bring followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh media broadcast," according to West Virginia News.
Saturday will be the second time in last month when Trump has visited West Virginia, a state that won over 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the research vote.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must arrive to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup: American team shows a fight and maintain hope heading for one-man game on Sunday
After three sessions leading to one side, two players' game for two Saturday afternoons may be the thrill that Ryder Cup needs
The motion of the electric wave is a highly designed concept of sports but which players believe the truth and even more in such competitions
So where will they say the speed is going now?
"They had a six-mark leadership and now it's four, so we take it as a little fast I think," said Jordan Spiith after concluding the day.
Europe has a better chance, of course, they are ahead with four points, remaining twelve to be fought.
Americans, as Spiith says, feel that they have extra strength and have much to encourage them, also considering Spieth and Justin Thomas's game who played together all day and each boasts three of four points.
Spiith has been dangerous from the start of the game to the game hole and leads by being a role model.
The majority of the festivals increased as his turn continued, importing the ball after hitting the ball to the hole and balancing while he and Thomas were down with two points after two turns.
His ball beat to the hole won a 15-story match and got a lot of noise to celebrate, which shows you believe that the American team is still not dead.
"You must really work hard and consider your own match," Spiith said.
Now that's just what these players have left to do now.
18 holes wait for them to show this.
The only players with more marks than Spiith and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the mysterious story of the Ryder Cup.
The remarkable pair from Europe has four of four points and have not now made any mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only pair that did not hit the ball more frequently on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided hitting the ball more frequently on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The quality, and how their powers seem to increase between them and the crowd show that the players will give the highest competition on Sunday and perhaps no other popular players can win for Europe when the day ends at Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
Vyema if all do so at the same time in different holes.
It's too early to discuss the victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced the right thing with Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in a two-party game against two, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
The extra ball and two more balls in the first nine holes placed Spanish and Swedish in a situation that was difficult from.
Sunday, however, no one can kill you in a situation you will get involved.
The two-party game against two is exciting to watch closely because of the collaboration between pairs, advice, advice that does not give and how strategy can change immediately.
Europe has done better as a team so far and took a major lead towards the last day but this pair period against pair has also shown that the American team has a fight that some, especially those in the United States, questioned.
Europe leads to 10–6 in Ryder Cup on the last day
Europe will have a good chance on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match and four balls for 10–6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's pair led the game twice against Tiger Woods who seemed to be overwhelmed and reached the total of their marks so far on Le Golf National as four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to pray with the shell that lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States that seemed to be overwhelmed in four morning balls, winning 3–1 series.
The United States offered more opposition in pair matches against pairs and won two matches, but they could not remove the shortage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to pray with the shell.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the end of the exciting week they became the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating the Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-season match collaborated well and won Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau for 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both matches Saturday, showed good game sessions but now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-season match and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested for a four-season match in the morning, returned to associate with Henrik Stonson in a pair match and 1 defeat with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not find everything although the day was beautiful, impressive in southwestern Paris.
The three-time winner of the main tournament Jordan Spiith and Justin Thomas set a model for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won the 2nd and 1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-season match and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup where the team has managed from the back with four points to one-man game, although Furyk team only needs from uniform to pray with the shell.
After being in second place for two days, however, the victory fight on Sunday seems to be far away from them.
North Korea says 'impossible' will remove weapons without believing that others will do what they should.
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was further weakening not believing in the United States and no way the country could remove its nuclear weapons without others doing what they should be under such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good measures of good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, breaking the nuclear test station and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any faith from the United States there will be no confidence in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will remove our weapons first without others doing what they should."
While Ri again insisted on North Korea's complaints regarding Washington's opposition to the "step" strategy by removing nuclear weapons where North Korea would get a little bit of action, his report seemed important as it did not reject the action to remove nuclear weapons on condition how Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current United States President and North Korean leader Singapuri on June 12, while Kim promised to work to "repose nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula" when Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking an official solution to the 1950–53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to call to cancel international sanctions against North Korea.
"U.S. insists" first the removal of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure rate by using restrictions to achieve their goal by forcing and even opposing "the final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The point that obstacles may not weaken are an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that ongoing obstacles continue to be distrustful.
"Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump which the U.S. leader hinted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead reflected three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If an ally in this matter of removing nuclear sleep would be South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this bad situation."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the move to aim for the United States mainland and North Korean rockets would not be avoided after "Bw. The Evil President" Trump refers to Kim as a "a rocket man" who aims to carry out murder.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destruction" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures to remove weapons, but said a great work should still be done and obstacles should pray until North Korea removed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council should put Pyongyang in action.
However, the U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the restrictions of the Security Council must continue deeply and without fail until we get the complete, final and proven nuclear weapons."
Together, the Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to remove funds for nuclear plans and Pyongyang missiles.
Pompeo met Ri after the United Nations General Assembly later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made, but only within several hours North Korea shocked him by offering "mass as a criminal."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy the missile station and also the nuclear weapon station if the United States takes "related measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "related steps" he wanted are a security guarantee that Trump promised as Singapuri and towards strengthening relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough rest.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to fight the culture of pretending to be deserted and read for 'all day' with coffee assistance.
‘ An expert discovered students at the university number one in the world are ignorant about the basic issue of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women Hospital, created the subject, which he believes is the first type in the United States.
. He was given a goal to create a lesson after giving a talk about how insufficient sleep affects training.
'At the end of the speech, one girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told these things now, in my last year?"
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which has been first established this year, describes students basics about how a good sleep style helps in professional and sports activities and also improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of intelligence at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said that the university decided to establish the subject after discovering that students had suffered severe sleep in the week.
The full - hour lesson involves a series of joint activities.
In one place there is a picture of the bedroom, where students press for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and described about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activity is affected by sleeplessness and the importance of the sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how long periods of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, fatigue and cancer.
The college map and the co-operation, then urges participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the subject will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the damage to health when you smoke, 'Profesa Czeisler added.
The proud culture in 'watch' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure on growing students mean lack of sleep was an ongoing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, which is good, you should be the student's 'secret weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind in a state of discontent and makes you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to form a subject, after participating in one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and gave him a desire to create a whole college class.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduating students to do the same lesson before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider keeping the sleep-time bell and also the time bell to wake up and understand the effects of 'a blue light' by the electric screens and the LED light, which can damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Bao is a young Gerrard
Rangers lost again in another foreign game when Dolly Menga's rugby was stolen Steven Gerrard's team that seemed to be overwhelmed by 1–0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was intended to win the first foreign victory since the 4–1 win against St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his team eight points behind the Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break with Rangers never seemed to balance it.
While Rangers now descend to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian only for the difference of the battalions.
And there may be more problems for Rangers after the bander Calum Spence needs treatment after being injured in the head with something aired from Rangers supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team which tied Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got uniforms against Hearts last week and will be pleased with how well his well-organized team faced their opponents all the time.
Rangers owned more ball but Livingston took advantage of their chances when they got the ball.
They had to close only the second minute when Menga's first ball gave Scott Pittman a chance towards Allan McGregor gate but the link threw the ball out.
The club from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defence Alan Lithgow was able to hit it just out of the goal.
Rangers took control but their game seemed only faithful but not confidence as they approached the closing area.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have to get a penalti in 15 minutes after being hit by Steven Lawless but refa Steven Thomson said the game goes on even after the Son's claim.
Rangers managed to hit two hits in the goal during the first half but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly gate was not very troubled by headball from Lassana Coulibaly and weak kwaju from Ovie Ejaria.
When Livi's goal in the 34th minute was not due to a regular game, no one can refuse to be eligible for the victory.
Again Rangers failed to deal with the rugby ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher infiltrated the ball Scott Robinson, who was strong and hit the ball towards Menga who touched and shut.
Gerrard made a decision during the break and changed Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the hio move was about to get results when the link slipped the ball Morelos but Kelly ran from his place and prevented the ball.
But Livingston continued to disrupt visitors and make them play as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long ball after another.
Holt's team could add goli in the last minutes but McGregor was stable and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out by head.
Rangers' reserve player Glenn Middleton had another claim of penalti in the last minute when they faced Jacobs but again refa Thomson ignored a request away.
Year's Shajara: Geiger County
And now a page from our year's "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and continue to be HUSABU ... the day later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger created a way to detect and measure radiation, a discovery that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger County.
The basis for science since then, Geiger County became popular in popular culture as well, as in the 1950 "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's the Counter Geiger device, used to discover the mineral of the flies, such as urranium.
When you put these head tools, you can hear the effects of atoms provided by the purchase within the mineral."
Evans: "Say, you're starting to sound now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery known by his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system 'see' bad cell
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system 'see' bad cells and kill them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of the treatment
Strategy involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in laboratory
Then they can 'see' a protein that is popular in many cancers and then re-set.
Experimental vaccine shows positive results in patients with various cancers.
One woman treated by vaccines, which teaches the immune system to identify a bad cell, was able to treat her ovari cancer for over 18 months.
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in laboratory so they can "see" a common protein for many cancers called HER2, and then reset the cells.
. Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Saratani Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very credible vaccine."
HER2 "causes growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovari, lungs and gut and puru, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to take immune cells from patients and "teach" how to aim cancer cells has worked in treating leukemia.
Kanye West Has Started a Tendefu with the Pain of Supporting Trump, Wearing the MAGA hat, After Seen in the SNL Period.
It didn't go well.
Kanye Kanye West was killed in studio during the Saturday Night Live after a high-profile show where he praised the United States President. Donald Trump and said he could hold office in 2020.
After the show of his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he was wearing a hat written at Make America Great, he began reprimanding the Democratics and promised support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white man often says: "How can you love Trump, he racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism I would leave the United States so long ago," he said.
The SNL began with a short performance involving Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on alleged sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the incident was not announced, West's word content was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West for the publication.
Also, West had complained about the audience that he had a difficult time before entering the stage in connection with his hat.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go there with the hat.'
They wronged me!
And then they said I'm in a state that I've sunk," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the place of sinking?" saying that he'll wear my brave hero's hat, because this means you can't tell me what I'm worth doing. You want the world to wander forward?
Try love."
His comments argued at least twice from the audience and the SNL staff who seemed embarrassed, Varity Station reported, and a man there reporting the publication: "The whole video went completely silent."
West had been brought to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love it, dressed as Perrier's water bottle.
West was supported by conservative leader TPUSA, Candace Turner who published tweet: "To one of the most brave people: ASANTE FOR KUSAMA AND UNMA."
But the host of the conversation show Karen Hunter published tweet that West was just "shows his attitude and that it is the best thing."
"But I choose to give someone else (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "season") who I believe agrees and spread a belief that is dangerous to my society.
He has freedom.
Even we too, "he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "known as Kanye West."

China has announced a 14% increase in the population of citizens who live with HIV and HIV.
Over 820,000 people are infected in the country, health leaders say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of the new events were caused by sex, and they indicate changes from the past.
HIV usually spread rapidly in other parts of China due to blood exchange.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had dropped to the suri, Chinese health leaders said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
. However, year after year, the number of those living with HIV and HIV in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is a tough issue in the LGBT community in China.
China's same-sex love was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is said to be too high.
Because of the conservative values of the country, research has estimated that 70–90% men in same-sex love eventually kill women.
Most disease infections come from and immunity during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with this issue.
Maxine Waters denies that his employee exposed the data of GOP senators, reprimanded 'a dangerous lie' and 'the theories of conspiracy'
U.S. MP Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that his employee published a personal description of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Demokrat MP from Los Angeles said the allegations were being spread by analysts and websites of "the tough right-wing followers".
"The lie, lies, and more meaningless lies," Waters said in a report on Twitter.
The explanation given is claimed to include home addresses and US senators' phone numbers Maseta Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The comments appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate panel to hear charges of sexual abuse against the selection of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The analysis occurred shortly after the senators shocked Kavanaugh.
Conservative areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that recognizes the source of publications was associated with Waters office and commented on Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"These basic claims are absolutely false and misleading, "The Waters continued.
"My worker - whose identity, his personal explanation, and his safety have been affected by these allegations of fraud and falsehood - never involved in exposing these comments.
These unfounded claims are absolutely false and completely misleading."
Waters' report was quickly used online, including former Minister of Information at White House Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he has no control of the right feeling to become the Commissioner of Parliament.
When a person is used for something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not be worried.
He should not question the purpose of the plaint.
He should be calm and unnerved.
"Fleischer appeared as comparing Waters' response to the criticism of the Democratics against Justice Kavanaugh, who was used by critics for appearing angry during the trial hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate through the Republican party who is struggling to remove Waters in the representative election, also published his ideas on Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he said to tweet.
In his report, Waters said his office had declared "the proper powers and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
"We will make sure that those who did this are exposed, "he continued," and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that destroy and danger to everyone and all my employees."
A survey of Johnny English Strikes Again - joke in Rowan Atkinson's weak spy
It is common to look at Brexit's impact in any new film based on England but that is not used in the review of another comedy-war film for Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Will the humor of personal joke in the subject of how we're reckless it'll be a new opportunity out of the country?
At any rate, Johnny English's eye-looking, a highly moving face has a license to make mistakes again in a second-made way—the name shows his more sign that he is designed with broad humor for non-speaking people.
He is actually a chizi investigator who despite strange claims for interesting appeal reflects Clouseau's qualities, Mr Bean's qualities and a person who contributed to one of the Chariots of Fire's landscape in the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He was initially involved as a traveler and a strange international man Atkinson at one time involved in Barclaycard TV broadcasts currently forgotten, leaving many if they have not been interested.
There is one or two things in this recent film JE.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching helicopter wearing a traditional suit of arms and rafadha flats changing for a while on his hat.
Atkinson's offer in physical comedy was evident here, but humor seems to be low and unnecessary, it is known because "great" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The humor seems to be targeting children and not adults and farewell to me with Johnny English's unique trips are not a beans and treasure how the quiet film humor of Atkinson as a character Bean.
The annual concept is now that England is in great trouble.
An online raider has been able to enter the secret network of British web and expose the identity of all British spies out of the workplace and surprising a fan at work - very sadly it was a very easy responsibility for Kevin Eldon.
In his last time as a proud prince and facing a lot of opposition and has already been completely affected in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing very well for his character corresponding to Teresa May but the story does not help him show these qualities.
His security advisors inform him that because the identity of each investigator has been exposed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher in a luxury school, but teaches informal training about how to be a secret spy: some good humor there, while English teaches detectives similar to the School of Rock film.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and merged with former Bough, re-elected by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, associated with the ship commander, a thrilling position where Vicki Pepperdine has not been involved.
So the characters corresponding to Batman and Robin but by destroying things in the Kingdom Secret Ministry are returning to work and in accordance with Olga Kurylenko acting like Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister seems to be more involved with the spy of the rugby who claims he can solve all technology problems in the United Kingdom: Jason Volta, who is inspired by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their most enjoyable journey : they pretend hotel ministers, set fire in a French luxury restaurant; they start riot and enter without permission in the Volta's grand boat; and English causes the kasheshe when trying to use improved Reality equipment to learn the interior of the Volta boat.
All rest has certainly been removed for this final sequence, but regardless of the appeal and turmoil combined, there are so many qualities of children's programming in the film hio.
Good forewear.
And just like Johnny English's other films I had to sell them again: Can't the British film sector give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice for his talent?
The Leba denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but be paid for five days.
The Leba led by Jeremy Corbyn will consider the strict deal that the British will work four days for wiku - but be paid five days.
The party is allegedly wanting corporate leaders to pay the money saved through false intelligence (AI) to the staff by giving them an extra day.
It will end the staff will grow up with three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said that the idea 'will be appropriate' the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Labour Union Center as a way for workers to take the opportunity for a changing economy.
The main source of the Leba Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy discrimination is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't be done once but four days of working are a goal that corresponds to the party's perspective in balancing the economy for the staff and also the party's general strategy for the sector.'
'The Leba Party will not be the first to recommend such an idea, the Green Party promised four days of work a week during its 2017 campaign for the general election.
Ari hio is currently not supported by all in the Leba Party, however.
Leba Party spokesman said: 'four days of work a week are not party policy and has not been considered by the party.'
The alternative Chansela John McDonnell spent the last week's Leba meeting to describe his experiences of the communist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had a resolution to remove power from 'unappearable agents' and 'rich' in service companies.
The alternative Chansela program also means that current customers in water companies will not be able to return all their funds because the Leba Government can make 'a reduction' on the grounds of recognized errors.
He also confirmed that plans to put workers on company boards and create the Rights of the Jumuish ownership to provide 10% of private companies' funds to employees, who will have the chance to get an annual assignment to €500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy describes the "60 minutes" if FBI investigation against Kavanaugh can change their mind
FBI investigation in charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote regarding its appointment in the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised a question if the FBI results can change the ideas of Republican senators to support them.
In an interview announced on Sunday, "60Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Senators.wa Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI can find anything that could cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said towards the case, I said, I've talked to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I called him after this happened, when the allegations came out, I said, 'Did you do it?"
He was firm, wise and accurate."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unchanged.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and will take a very serious charge," he said.
"Dk. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett refused strongly, "Graham added, meaning Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved could not prove.
It's 36 years now.
I don't see something new to change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizen Festival, a music event that includes a fascinating list of stars singing and also the same interesting message; ending poverty in the world.
Now in his seventh year, the World Country Festival will lead tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also increase awareness for the true purpose of the incident to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which said in 2012 that it is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people facing directly against it.
To get a free event ticket (except if you would like to pay the VIP ticket), the concert supporters had to complete a series of operations, or "acts" such as self-dependent, send emails to the world leader, call or any other efforts to help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the World Citizen Festival been successful remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of selling people to free concert tickets is a real way to persuade people to push for action, or just another case known as "only online activism" - people feel if they bring a real difference by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Civil Festival says it has hired over 19 million "acts" from its supporters to different goals.
It says these actions have urged world leaders to announce promises and policies corresponding to $37 billion that will change the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group showed 390 promises and advertisements based on its actions, at least $10 billion already distributed or beaten.
The group estimates the funds available so far that they have directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises include The Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and donors in the United Kingdom aimed at "help children reach all their potential," promising to offer 35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,,700 tweet from World Citizens.
"With help from the British government, philanthropists, national governments, and World Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of poor nutrition only history," Power Ambassador of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were completed in asking Britain to improve nutrition for mother and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and good nutrition.
In answer to a question in the question and Answers section on its website that asked "is it makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Citizens of the World Citizen Festival replied: It'll be a long and hard way - sometimes we'll fall and lose.
But, with human rights activists and groups against racism before us, we will succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is one of the stars who will sing in the event in New York, which the locals will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to "stop" Russian foreign energy sales - Minister of Interior
Washington can "if needed" to use its Marines to prevent Russian energy sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has said, as described by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's participation in Syria - especially, where it works with a legal government invitation - it is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are that the Middle East is to find energy markets how they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and strategies to deal with it.
"The United Nations has that capacity, along with our Marines, to ensure that sea routes have been opened, and, if necessary, prevent, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing members who attended the event hosted by the Users Energy League, a non-profit group that says it represents "the voice of energy users" in the United States.
He continued to compare the ways in which Washington uses to coincide with Russia and Iran, saying that the countries are similar.
"The economic crisis for Iran and Russia is, according to use and change oil," he said, referring to Russia as "a limited knowledge" and economy based on coal oil.
The information comes when Trump's regime has been on a mission to increase its sales of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which has been a very cheap option for European users.
As a result, Trump's administration leaders, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" project of the "Nord Stream 2," which according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Nord Stream 2 billion, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion volume, is only an economic project.
Kremlin says that most Washington's opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is not appropriate to be a pressure tool and that users should be able to choose sales," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has been used by Germany, which has confirmed his commitment to the project.
The German governing organization in the sector, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has wanted the United States to abstain from the European Union's energy policy and two-state contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chansela Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "He Will Look Deeply" candidate for presidency in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he could "look deeply" if he ran for presidency after the parliamentary election.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and reform our damaged government and which includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look deeply if I run for presidency."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in a wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," he said.
Warren has been discussing his opposition to Trump and his selection of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In the tweet he published on Friday, Warren said "we certainly need an FBI investigation before voting."
"A study released on Thursday, however, showed a large number of voters in Warren do not feel that he should run for 2020.
59% of "can" voters vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two% supported such running.
Research showed further support for former Governor Deval Patrick's complaint, 38% supporting and 48% refusing.
Other notable names of the Democratics who are considered to have the ability to run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions stress caused by a terrifying incident for Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after returning, I can understand other families that are going through the effects of stress caused by some of the effects our soldiers return with, "he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin cited the point of arresting him as "a complex thing that is being avoided" and said that his son and other war soldiers, "returning in contrast, returning with a hard belief, they return wondering if there is respect that they are on the ground and every other military partner, by his commitment to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic abuse of a woman and affected a report of domestic abuse and arms while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, DC support new immigration policy
Eightteen states and Columbia District support law resistance to a new American policy that rejects refuge for victims fleeing crime or domestic abuse.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a small report of friends-of-the-mamama on Friday in Washington to support seeking refuge in opposition to policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainer in Grace v. v. Sessions which was presented by the United States Civil Freedom Union held in August against the policy of the country has not been exposed.
He said his lover "and his sons members of a criminal group," he persecuted him but U.S. officials rejected his refuge request on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Supporters of countries Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing the problems of criminal groups and domestic violence.
A new refuge policy in the United States changed the 2014 decision with the Immigrant Board that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic abuse to be given refuge.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in Friday's report that new policy "is ignoring decades of state law, country and international."
"The law of the country requires that all claims of refuge be determined according to the truth and specific circumstances of claims, and the refusal violates the principle," said a friend-of-the-mamama report.
More lawyers said in reports that a policy prohibiting immigrants from entering has a negative impact on the American economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "give important services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide refuge for victims who fled domestic abuse and criminal groups in June.
"The refuge is available to those fleeing their country due to bullying or fear due to race, religion, nation, or membership in a group of communities or political views," Sessions said in the 11 June announcement about the policy.
The action to provide refuge was not intended to solve all problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Many rescue efforts in Palu as the number of disasters doubled in the race for survivors,
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It seems very bad," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever child at the rescue center in Palu.
"Every minute a ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available."
"The workers seemed returning to their damaged homes, taking water-watered equipment, trying to save anything they could get.
Hundreds of people were injured while hospitals, destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, unable to control the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, saw him outside the Palu Army Hospital , where patients were being treated outside because of the continued tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he recited how a severe earthquake shook the room in the fifth floor of the hotel where they had his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save himself.
I was buried in walls rubble, I think, " Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then he became silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador to China for 'disguation' through 'disguise advertising'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page announcement in the American newspaper that shed light on the common benefits of the American and Chinese trade, the United States ambassador to China called Beijing on the use of American Journalists to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Sunday referred to China Daily's scholarship to Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa State - after scoring China by seeking to interfere with the United States delegation election on November 6, claims that China has opposed.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US election show what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's fast-run campaigns to push China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to keep advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing in business wars that have led to an increase in the tax rate of each other's products.
China's early revenge in business was designed to affect foreign dealers from states such as Iowa which supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to UChina and former governor of Iowa, the main supplier of foreign agricultural products in UChina, said Beijing had a negative impact on American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a piece of opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reduces the injustice by posting propaganda broadcasts on independent media."
"In distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a way that has been sponsored by the United States of freedom of opinion and free information by posting paid ads on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, in the local newspaper sections in Beijing, you will find very few voices give opposition and you will not be able to see the real and different views that Chinese people may have about the difficult goals of Chinese economy, considering that the media are controlled closely by the Chinese Communist Party, "he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what magazine.
Republican Separate Women's Kuras Toward the House of Representatives With the Kavanaugh Crisis, An Analysis Warn
With many supporters defending a selection in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in facing several allegations of sexual abuse, critics have warned that they will have serious consequences, especially from women, during the election of representatives.
The feeling around this has been very high and most of the Crepublicans showed clearly that they wanted to continue the vote.
These things cannot be returned, "Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he is concerned that the last-time pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for FBI investigation would be enough to sell voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget tomorrow and even all November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the MoveOn development group said on Friday, according to Washington DC.
Friday morning, protesters sang "November comes!" when they marched on the Senate highway when the Crepublicans who are in control of the Court Committee chose to continue and be appointed to Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of democracy have exceeded expectations", "Stu Rothenberg, an independent political critic, told the news site.
"People say you've already reached a high level; that's true.
But it may be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and small voters, aged 18 to 29, who when they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford public evidence described sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's selection, critics said the bad consequences could follow if the NajRepublicans will continue and confirm.
"This has been a mud game for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Crepublicans earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"Not only about the committee vote or final vote or if Kavanaugh is appointed, it is also about the way the Crepublicans have dealt with this and how they treated him ," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps select the Wademokrats, has said at the news station.
However, Americans seem to have some division about who is trustworthy after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with many leaning on Kavanaugh.
New research from YouGov shows that 41% of the participants are clear or perhaps believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said it was obvious or perhaps believed in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said that Kavanaugh was clearly or perhaps lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent have said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI currently investigates claims made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford witnessed before the Senati Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh persecuted him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the Supreme Court's selection revealed its private parts when they attended the ceremony while they were at school in Yale in the 1980s.

Bernard Vann: A priest who won the Victoria Cross Award during WWW1
The only British Church priest to win Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena Shepherd Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed by a target raider four days later and never found out that he had won the highest British military award.
The monument is revealed by two of his grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that "it's a strange example" that the stone is revealed especially 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his squad alongside Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a heavy fog and a sharp shooting from the field and gun."
He later ran to the shot line and with "the greatest adventure" led the line forward before using a field gun alone and aimed at three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German target raider on 4 October 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "the actions I know I can't reach but are very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a flower crown after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth's Bendi.
Michael Vann said "he was very respectful to participate in a parade" and added "the courage of a real hero is shown by support from many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig instead,
Consider this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 but just be rejected to watch the main event.
Bili from San Jose included 13 battles, including six on the main card and was flying straight all night in England via Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to be fated, viewers in England were left open when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed after remaining awake until early hours especially for fighting.
One poem on Twitter described changing and putting children's cartoons as "a kind of terrible joke."
"It is a federal principle where it came at 6 a.m. content was not so appropriate that they had to change the program to be for children," said Dave Schwartz, Vice president of markets and communications of Bellator, when asked about transmission."
"" Peppa the pig, "yes."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they would go to work on their schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the return, I think we can probably consider this," Coker said.
"But now it's 12 a.m. Sunday there and we can't consider this until Sunday at our time, Monday when they are.
But we take it into account.
I believe, when it changed, there was a lot of messages being sent and it didn't grow well.
We were trying to fix, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you that the future will not happen.
We'll put it in five battles instead of six - as we do normally - and we tried to work hard for fans but we failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'weak' due to her gender
A diver at Olympia Tom Daley says he felt weak because of his gender throughout his growth - but this gave him the challenge of success in life.
This 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he joined high school then "I realized that not everyone like me."
Speaking at Radio 4 at Desert Island Discs station prepared by Lauren Leverne, he says he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others "hopes."
He says that the step of parenthood made him less focused on winning in Olympia games.
A long-term producer, Kirsty Young, has been out for a period of illness.
Share it as a isolated person in Laverne's first period, Daley says he felt "having some less" than everyone of his age because "it was not accepted to love girls and boys."
He said: "Hadi today, those feelings of self-determination and limitations, and feeling different from others are things that have given me strength and ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he could not discourage anyone when they finally discover his gender.
The double winner of the bronze medal to move the Olympian games has been a prominent member in the support of LGBT and was used a furasa to participate in the Commwealth games in Australia to urge more countries not to consider the same-sex sex issue as a crime.
He said he made his appearance because he felt lucky to be able to live without effect and wanted to give others "hopes."
This Bingwa three times in the world said to love another man - American filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "found him unexpectedly."
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is an elder to be around him for 20 years, last year but said that the age gap has never been a big issue.
"When you go through many things at a very young age" - he went to the first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had gone through such things.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his attitude" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold goal is Robbie."
"His son has the same name as Robert's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they still had their Olympic tickets in London 2012 - because he wanted to be the front column.
"I couldn't tell him 'you can't go near the line hio father'," he said.
"I had caught his hand when he stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and die I believed he had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won copper.
"I just knew that this was what I had been waiting for all my life - diving before our crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also urged his choice of the first song - Maud by Heather Small - which had given him a challenge during the Olympic preparation and made him a simony.

Mickelson who has been a poor laugh is placed on a bench in Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will keep a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so that he will not reach the point without joy.
Mickelson, playing in a two-time event a year and set a 12th-time play record, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and a pair game.
Instead of being in the depth of the event, how often he was for the United States, this five major tournament winner divided his day between being a fan and practicing a game in hopes of correcting his problem.
It is never a leader even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for the game in Le Golf National, whose bad ball is punished from time to time.
And if the field is not enough reason, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, he faces British champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the new player Tommy Fleetwood and wins all four matches of this week.
If Americans, who are four points back as they start one 12th match, have a strong resistance, Mickelson's match can prove to be absolutely important.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, greeted me and embraced me and assured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great courage in his power.
He is a celebrity and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't see him playing two matches.
I expected her to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should consider.
He wants to be out there playing, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for many matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It may be its end in playing the Ryder Cup that has never been identical to his personal record.
Mickelson wins 18, 20 loss and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's funny, brave, likes to joke people and is a good man to have him in the team," he explained.
"I think that young players were also happy to fight him too this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more contribution than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the leadership of many marks can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a major leadership entering the last days of the Ryder Cup can turn into a nervous journey.
The Danish played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros led with five points against Americans but finished while the game was on fire, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding ourselves that we had a great leadership in Valderrama; we had a great leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very closely," said Bjorn, being photographed, after watching the 2018 Class winning 5–3 Friday and yesterday and leading 10–6 in Le Golf National.
So history marks me and everyone on the team that the game is not yet over.
You'll go more aggressive there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you have done things as they should.
This game has not ended until you get a score.
We have a goal and it's trying to win this shell and that's what we aim for.
I've said this all the time, I'm considering 12 players who are in our team, but we know well the quality of the team's best team in the world.
"It was pleased with how his players did in a hard field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't have more hope of this in this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity that will determine and that is different.
It's good to be out there and the partner when things are interesting, but when you're out there alone, then you've been fully tested for all your ability as a golf player.
That's the message you need to tell players, it's to act your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner to go and act better on his own, too.
"Unlike Bjorn, captain of the opposition team Jim Furyk will send his players to act better personally compared to when they played as allies, except Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three of four points.
Furyk himself was involved in the popular games on the last day, after becoming part of the winning team in Brookline before finishing the defeat when Europe found "The Medinan City."
"I remember every word," he said when he was awarded about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, brought his players together to the last day.
"We have 12 key matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as it was in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
While the speed goes in one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We organized our players effectively and put people in a way that we felt we preferred, you know, we're trying to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the fight and deal with Rory McIlroy in the top match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter other in the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it shines all the journey," said Bjorn for his choice of players in a private game.
A new German warship is re-remarked
The newest German Navy was planned to be launched in 2014 to replace the old ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to poor systems and the increase in cost, the media reported.
"Rheinland-Pfalz launch," the leading ship between the new Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit's newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the issues of later transmission affected the fate of this large project.
Four Baden-Weerttemberg ships that Navy ordered in 2007 come to replace Bremen's battleships.
It is known that they will include a power sect, a range of rugby and aircraft and decorative missiles and ship-based missiles as well as secret technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and akostic signals.
Other important components include organizations after a long time - it is possible to send the new ships for two years away from home.
However, the ongoing delay means that the high-profile warships - said to allow Germany to aim abroad—they will already be out of place when they are used, explained Die Zeit.
The F125 was popular last year, when German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to ship builders after the presentation.
There is little known about the reasons for restoration, but German media referred to several reasons for "the important programming and chips" that made ships less important if they were taken to war.
The shortage in the program was important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship will be operated by only 120 crew - half of the crew on Bremen's old ships.
It also happened that the ship has an extra weight something orblo reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to improve the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship of 7,000 tons is believed to weigh twice as much as the identical ships used by Germans in the Great War II.
Besides faulty chips, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is also a major issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion yuro ($3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion yuro.
The problems facing new ships are particularly important from warning that the ability of German watermanship has dropped.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Uanawater actually "is going to miss ships capable of being sent to war."
The officer said that the issue has been ignored for a long time, because the old ships were removed but no alternative ships were offered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships would be used by the Navy.
Nationa Trust takes the secret life of bats
New research conducted in the Scotland Mountains aims to explain how bats are using the environment in hunting their food.
You expect these results to provide new details about the behavior of these unique flying animals and helping to conduct future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow pipistrelles and soprano bats as well as long - eared bats and Daubenton bats in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special Rekoda will be placed in key areas near the area to track bat operations throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct telephone investigations using hand-based reviews.
Sound analysis of all records will confirm the frequency of bats and the species that does so.
Environmental map and reports will be released to create a deep-speed environment for their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant in NTS, expects the results to show what environmental areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
This explanation will help determine the benefits of environmental management such as pasture production and better ways to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and England has declined considerably over the past century.
They pose a threat from the construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind and lights can also cause danger, as well as pesticides and some chemical products of building materials, as well as the attacks of pets.
Pops are not particularly blind.
However, from their night hunting habits their ears are more important than their eyes arrive is a step to catch prey.
They use a complex method of echoing the area to aim for insects and obstacles in their way.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens 76,000 acres (76,000 ha) of land across the country, considers bats very seriously.
It has provided training for ten trained experts, who occasionally do research, nest inspection and sometimes save bats.
The organization has even established the first and unique bat reserve in Scotland on Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, where it is home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson has said the property is the best place for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good surroundings.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He insists on the importance of watching the presence of bats before making organizations within property because it is possible for unconscious damage can kill to female bats and 400 young bats, and perhaps destroy all the number of bats in the area.
Pops are protected and illegal to kill, harass or disrupt or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrrell, a Scottish officer at the Popo Conservation Agency, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats because most of our species do not know how many of our species remain."
Ronaldo denies rape claims while lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the allegations of rape against him are "false news," saying that people "want to declare themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have planned to have a German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus have been charged with raping an American woman , named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have later paid him $35,000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on the live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, reprimanded the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, "five times the Ballon d'Or Award winner says on the camera."
"They want to promote themselves with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be popular by naming my name, but it's part of the work.
I'm happy and I'm all right, "The player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they said is "unacceptable information of suspicion in the private area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek a ransom for "moral damage according to the seriousness of violations, which may be one of the biggest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have been held in June 2009 in a chumba at Palms Hotel and Kasino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported returning to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him in the back, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him that for "99%" he is a "good" man who was dropped by "one%."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the jwa had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says that he went to report to the police and was photographed of his injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an external court compensation because he felt "a fear of revenge" and was concerned about "the humiliation of the public."
The 34 - year - old woman says she is now ready to regret the ransom because she continues to be troubled by the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the allegations, and this season moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought for £100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' for losing auto manufacturers
England 'will regret forever' for losing its position as world leader in auto manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was placing "the concerns" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without contract it could stop for the time of production in his factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark
Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of delays in borders if no contract after Brexit led to unemployment.
Burnaston Factory - which makes Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year where 90% were sold abroad in the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the European Union in March we will see the point of stopping production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fear of leaving the European Union without an agreement on how the border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues are related to what manufacturers say are the dangers of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is implemented on the basis of "time-season", and equipment arriving every 37 minutes from salesmen in the United Kingdom and the European Union for ordered vehicles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there may be problems in the border that the sector says can cause delays and lack of equipment.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more one day at his Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will be suspended.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's program of Checkers of later relations with the European Union is "rightly planned to avoid the investigation in the border."
"We need to have a plan. We want to have a better deal that will allow not only success at present but also take up the opportunity, "he told BBC Radio 4.
"The witness from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we really need to be able to continue getting the distribution that has been successful in the past."
Toyota could not say the time of the suspension of production, but for a long time, warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Union in the factory, said his allies are increasingly concerned: "In my experience after these jobs have never returned.
A government spokesman said: "We have set a proper and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump Conference with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting and deputy general lawyer Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed for another week" with a conflict with the high court selection Brett Kavanaugh going on, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser David Mueller, who is investigating the intervention of elections with Russia, the relationship between Trump and Russia's assistants and the possibility of a fair prevention with the president.
If or not Trump seeks the work of the deputy general lawyer and thus endanger Mueller's independence, it has sparked Washington's speculation for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to White House, being said to have been about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at a United Nations conference in New York, was announced to take place on Thursday.
Trump said "a favor" not to dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid collision with a case in the Senate Court Committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, all witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week FBI investigation in allegations against Kavanaugh, resulting in delays in the full Senate vote.
Trump's journalist Sarah Sanders, was in Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "Tarehe for that is not set, it may be this week, I can see that causing it to be pushed back for another week considering the things in the high court.
But we will see what will be and inform the media.
"Some journalists could oppose the words: Sanders has not hosted a press conference in White House since September 10.
The owner Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information is not due to the lack of favour of television journalists "to attract attention," although he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct contact between Trump and reporters would increase.
"The president holds sessions of Questions and Answers than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning evidence: "We've looked at those statistics."
"The release of information to journalists will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media have the chance to ask him direct questions of the United States president, that's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it many times and you've seen doing it more in the past few weeks and that this will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump repeatedly responds to questions during leaving White House or participates in open settings or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media alone are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving random speech and sometimes appearing before the gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to European Union staff at the Health Agency Scotland about Brexit's fear
Health Minister has written to European Union staff working at the Health Agency Scotland expressing gratitude for the country and expecting them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter while remaining six months until the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union.
The Scottish government has offered to reach the cost of residential applications for European Union citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In summer, talks between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding withdrawal have continued, towards decisions expected this season of search.
But the British Government also improves its provisions for an impossible solution.
I know this is a very unhappy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how much I appreciate the contribution of each worker, regardless of their nationalism.
Wenzetu from all over the European Union and more, they bring valuable experience and knowledge that strengthen and improve the healthcare work, and help the sick and the community we serve.
Scotland is your home completely and we want to stay here."
Christion Abercrombi is performed Emergency Surgery After Head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombi was underwent emergency surgery after getting a head injury in a game that failed 31–27 on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Tennessee's chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the edge and only collapsed," Reed said.
The staff and medical doctors gave Abercrombi oxygen on the banks before putting him on the stretcher for further assessment.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV period in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombi had been completed in surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no description of the type/season of pain still" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombi, a first-class student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five confrontations on Saturday before leaving the game, which added a total of confrontations in season to 18.
Foreign consumers will be paid a high stamp tax buying in England
Consumers from foreign countries will be paid a high stamp tax buying property in the UK with additional funds used to help homeless people under the new Tory program
The hio aims to balance Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be paid to those who do not pay their tribute in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to $120 million annually - to help homeless people.
Foreign consumers will be paid a high stamp tax if they buy property in the UK - and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The move will appear as an attempt to balance the success Jeremy Corbyn has gained to attract young voters with a promise to provide affordable homes and target those with high income.
The increase in stamp tribute will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay their tribute in the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government's plan to fight housing conditions for people without their homes.
The extra payment - which includes current stamp tribute, including high standards set two years ago in the second houses and rental homes - may be up to three%.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the hio action will give it up to $120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new buildings are purchased by non-English residents, resulting in an increase in prices and make it difficult for the first buyers to buy their first home.
Many rich parts of the country - especially in the capital - have been "screaming" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend their most time abroad.
A new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson requested a cut in stamp tribute to help younger people buy their first house.
He shocked large construction companies by putting property prices high by purchasing farms and failing to build and ask Mrs. May to stop and charge the house to repair the "president in the UK's housing sector".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a fascinating series in residential reform, including tax control to end the state of expulsion "without error".
He also wants to give the councillors more authority to build a new house.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I wanted to volunteer to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our damaged residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it cannot be fair to people who do not live in England, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes at the same price as hard workers in the UK.
For so many people the dream of ownership of the house has been far away and there is a lot of chance of being homeless."
Jack Ross: 'The fate of my resolution is to be a Scottish boss'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "season" is to be a Scottish manager in a period.'
This 42-year-old, is very happy with the challenge of resurrecting the North-east club, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from above.
He moved to Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scotland League last season.
"I wanted to play my country as a player.
I was able to get a team game B and reached that point, "Ross told BBC Scout's Sportsound.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and I was always impressed with that thing.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I'm successful in club management."
"The predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he had no fear of following the popular names in such a large club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this time will be measured by 'how, can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the design and equipment in this club, it should certainly be in the British Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to return, but I'd just like to see myself if I've been successful here if I can return the club up there."
"Ross is only three years since he started management work, after the show as manager's assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a tutor worker at Hearts club.
He then helped Alloa from being lowered to the third grade and replaced St Mirren from being lowered to winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says she feels better than she was when playing Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Some was a real way," he remembered, to take Alloa's administration.
"I certainly believed management was better for me, more than playing.
It seems strange because I did the same, I got the income from playing and enjoying the highest level of conditions.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still go through this in the matter of stress and work pressure but I feel management is all right.
I always wanted to be a supervisor and now I do it, I feel better in me in my entire life of being an adult."

The best time for alcohol is 11.30 p.m. Saturday, research has discovered
Summer heat has increased drinking in British struggling bars but has increased pressure on restaurants.
Baa got a 2.7% increase in July - but drinking in restaurants dropped to 4.8%, data showed.
Peter Martin, of CGA's commercial adviser, which included the data, said: "The continuation of the sun and the most temporary participation of the UK in the World Cup means July followed the same example as last June, while bars had an increase of 2.8%, except that restaurants had even more impact.
A 1.8% cut in the restaurant business in June was even more damaged in July.
The beverages' bills did better while restaurants had a cut.
Food bills were affected in the summer, although not as restaurant operators.
It seems people just want to go out and get alcohol.
Controlled bills got a 6.6% sales increase in sales per month and food being reduced by three%."
"Paul Newman, entertainment analyst and hospitality in RSM said: "These results continue in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social events or sports are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the home market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the decline in sales of 4.8% per year will be very painful considering ongoing cost pressure.
The long-term summer has arrived at the worst time for food service providers and we'll have to wait if the average temperature we got in August will change things to better."
"The overall growth of sales in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7% in July, compared to the decline of brand products.
Marketing monitoring in the Coffer Peach Tracker sector for bars and restaurants collects and criticizes the data of activity from 47 working groups, with a total of more than $9 billion sales and is an important model in the sector.

One out of five children - some even 11 - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research reveals
Research for 20,000 high school students has shown growth in pages "Insta fake"
The report has caused fear that sexual content is published
Twenty% of students said they own a "great" account to show parents
One of five children - some even 11 - create fake social media accounts that keep secrets from adults.
Research for 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the account "Insta fake" - reference to the Instagram website.
News has increased fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty% of students said they are creating a "great" account to show parents, while also own other private owners.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a young man urging others to "bake."
The Digital Awareness UK and the British High School Teachers Association (HMC), found 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two and a half accounts of them agreed to keep an account privately.

Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletes board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletes board as an active director at the year's general meeting of the federal board.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the game to benefit from his extensive experience in the international level over the past decade.

Doctors said it would be known only in time if I could recover and how much.
It has been a hard task to recover fully, learn again how to walk and today make a re-connaissance!
Thanks to the message of comfort!"
A breast pump announcement that compares mother to cattle raises different online views
The breast pump company has distributed comments online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to milk cows.
To indicate the launch of what is known as "the most silent breast pump in the world," the user's technology company Elvie released a comedy music video broadcast to show the freedom the new pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers play dens in a barn filled with cow food for a song that includes such words as: "Well, I'm milking myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't realized this is not my breasts."
The song continues: "Get out, decide out, I feed children, milk out, milk out, decide out, I decide my women."
However, a announcement, published on Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
For 77,000 times to be watched by hundreds of comments, the video has received different views from viewers and many say it shows the "fear" of the milk sector.
"A terrible decision using cows to announce this product.
If we need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their children are removed immediately after birth, "one wrote.
Elvie's breast tape enters very well inside the breast-feeds (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It bothers mother and child to think.
But why not use them to announce a breast pump to mothers who remain with their children?"
Another person added: "A declaration that does not focus on reality."
Others defended an announcement and a woman agreed that she felt the song "slaughter."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I would find one if I were still breast - feeding.
The decision made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is stupid but I understand it.
This is a product of high design, "one wrote.
Another person said: "This is a fun announcement that focuses on mothers who milk (often in the workplace or toilet) and feels like "beg."
"This is not a declaration of praise or shock to the milk sector."
At the end of the video a group of women shows that all have been playing with a pump on their boxers.
The concept of campaign is based on knowledge that many women who use pump say they feel like cows.
Elvie's album however, is absolutely silent, it has no cable or tyubu and fits entirely within the breast-feed and gives women freedom by moving, holding their children and even going out when they milk.
Ana Balarin, ECD's partner and teacher in Mother said: "The Elvie tape is a revolutionary product that qualified for a bold and inspiring launch.
In view of the thinness between describing women and dairy we wanted to put the act of breast - feeding and all its challenges in oversight, showing in a pleasant and interesting way of the sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump hit the headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, a mother of two children walked on the stage for the architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Retrieved Secret to Tent Camp in the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased even though the number of passers has not changed, because politics and strict policies issued by Trump's regime have made it difficult to keep children with philanthropists.
Typically, many philanthropists have become unregistered immigrants and have been afraid to risk their ability to pray in the country by continuing to claim a child.
The danger increased in June, when the country's authority announced that the donors possible and other household adults would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared by the immigration authority.
Last week, Mathew Albence, senior officer of Ambassador and Customs, witnessed before Congress that the organization had captured several people who had requested to fund the children alone.
The organization later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"About 80% of people who are philanthropists or family members are here illegally and most of them are criminal guests.
. So we continue to track the people, "Mr. Albence said.
In the process of cutting children faster, leaders established new laws that would require some of them to be presented in court within a month after being arrested, instead of 60 days, which was a custom before, according to residential workers.
Many will be presented via a meeting phone via video, instead of being present, asking their case for legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of their help will soon be returned to their land.
How a child remains in detention for a long time is the possibility of fear and anxiety or discouragement, which can cause feelings of violence or attempts to escape, according to residential personnel and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
The lawyers said these issues are increasing in large stations such as Tornillo, where the sign that a child has a bad condition is ignored, due to its size.
They added that transferring children to the tent city without giving enough time to provide them emotionally or interact with friends the last time could add to what many are already going through.
Syria tells the 'American, French and Turkish troops to leave immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Kad al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although it has now reached eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be handled accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and without any terms," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "war against terrorism was about to be completed" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been thrown into their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy war until we saved all Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
"University has about 2,000 Syrian troops, especially for training and counseling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in a war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return and blamed "western countries" for "the spread of false fear" that has caused refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and human organizations to enable return steps," he said.
"They put politics on the human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no construction assistance for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a isolated bafa area in the last Idlib rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to advance with political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has prevented the attacks of Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had "open time" and expressed hope that military action will help militants including fighters from Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be finished."
United Nations Commissioner Staffan de Mistura hopes to host the first meetings of a new committee that includes members of the government and the opposition to provide a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the electoral route.
Moualem set terms for the participation of the Syrian government on the committee, saying the panel's work should be controlled "to investigate the current constitution passages," warning against intervention.
Why Trump Wins Again Election for Second Age
With this logic, Mr. Trump will again win the 2020 election unless viewers like development and many changes hope that, the removal of the crime of mismanagement and scandals will end his presidency early.
And be of course "the greatest end of the presidency forever!"
Currently, there are no signs of the fatigue of the viewer.
Since 2014, the estimate of the main times has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and about three to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers, an increase from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's show "The Rachel Madow Show" leads to cable television assessment for 3.5 million viewers on the main night of news.
"These are things that draw people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer ABC "Designated Survivor," about a minister who becomes president after an attack to destroy Capitol's main offices.
Nel Scovell, former comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said," because he makes me laugh, "" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories from Washington may later decide Roe v. v Wade's case, if immigrant families can re-unification with the health of the world economy.
The appearance is just a luxury for viewers with many opportunities they can afford.
However, this issue exceeds a discerning citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to watch the panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "long" in the sources of his book "Fear," the £15,000th skin seat of Paul Manafort's designer ("a heavy proud dress, "Washington Post said) and the result of Stormy Daniels' description of Mr. Trump's body.
I, never, will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"The part of what he does and makes it look like a real show is that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the "Pawn Stars," about Trump's period changing characters and scenes daily (starting confrontations in NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't want to miss one period or stop track.
When I approached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was 80 degrees outside his house to the north of Kauai, but he was locked in looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave there, not as Brett Kavanaugh approaching to go before the Senate Court Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court if unknown.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing periods in the past and people were saying," this is the last beginning of Western civilization, "" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign funds flood within the closest election of Parliamentary representatives
It is no wonder that 17 Pennsylvania districts have suffered financial flooding, due to the re-connaissance of parliamentary districts that found two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
The new district of Pittsburg has Representative Sondede Conor Lamb - who won his seat in other districts in the final special election of the spring season.
Lamb is running for another person's commitment, the Crepublican Keith Rothfus, the current leader representing the former 12th Pennsylvania district, which is widespread and 17 new.
The maps were re-designed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that former districts had been painted to fit the Crepublicans.
The robbery in 17 new has established financial competitions in the collection of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Crepublican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a prominent name in Pennsylvania after a minor victory in a special election that was widely pursued in March in the 18th Pennsylvania Parliamentary District.
The seat had been held by the Crepublican for more than one decade and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts say the Wademokrats have a little better win.
The United States imagined to punish El Salvado for Supporting China, Then I Left
The diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and a small pressure to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the allies threw the Trump Corporation's management team.
Officials in the State Department decided to remove the U.S. diplomatic message from El Salvado, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," the department spokesman Heather Nauert, said in an early report this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvado, which earned $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included reduction in financial aid and restrictions on visa applications, would have a significant impact on the Central American country and unemployment and high rates of murder.
As domestic meetings continue, North American and Central American leaders proposed a high-profile meeting on security and economic well-being and following a similar meeting last year that seemed to be a forward step in an effort to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-final, the top leaders of the regime declared that they wanted the meeting to continue forward and effectively stop any punishment consideration for El Salvado.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled to take place in mid- October, with a sign of the importance that the regime has placed at the convention, diplomats said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvado, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new strong message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton refused to report on the discussion of the debate by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal dialogue without revealing identity.
Their views were confirmed by an external critic near the regime and also spoke without revealing identity.
History Survey
The next fall may be a special lawyer Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possibility to prevent justice, where there is now a great evidence in the public.
Mr. Mueller also directs his investigation as Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in attacking our election.
If Parliament changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing commitment cases in the parliament, just as he prepares to go again to ask for votes and perhaps finally the judges of his allies.
These are many things that currently say only possible and I don't say that Mr. Trump's removal in power is inevitable - nor for leaders like him in Europe.
There are options that must be made by every Atlantic side that will affect the long-term struggle.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a coup against Hitler, only if Western nations refused to support and support Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of murder.
The direction of history surrounds such changes and the stability of the course of democracy is being rushed or delayed.
Americans are facing several changes currently.
What will we do if Mr. Trump cancels Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in critical condition since the newspaper reported that last year, he proposed recording the president secretly and said he was not eligible to be afini.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times's memory is incorrect.
"How can we respond if a new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh would not be complete and fair - or if he is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we be able to vote in the election of Parliamentary representatives who will not be able to make Mr. Trump consider righteousness?
If we fail these measurements, democracy will face the risk of prolonged decline.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakia who was transferred to Auschwitz by the Nazi government that once used my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to the United States and, 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika signal.
With that as my inheritance, how can I lack a positive attitude toward our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has many hopes before the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers is a native of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good win from the G Group in the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented the link Graham Dorrans from playing his first match this season to a 2–2 uniform against Villarreal but believes Rangers can use the results to start many things.
"It was a good mark for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game if we believed we could get something and we returned with one score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, in general, uniform was probably the same result.
They were probably better in the first half and went in the second half better.
Entering Thursday, it's another big night in Europe.
We hope, we can get all three points but you'll be a hard game because they got a good result in their last game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year it was very difficult, between everything that happened to my casualties and changes in the club but there's a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is the same as players are very happy; your training is the same.
We expect, we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed."
Women are sleepless from the fear of savings for retirement
While being true that research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted care, a few people were talking to their families about this.
About half of the people in nationwide research said they were talking to their lovers about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family partners to care for them, but they don't take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide insurance industry.
This is how one starts.
Talking to your boyfriend and children: You can't provide your family to provide services if you don't make your wishes well known before time.
Share it with your mentor and family to discuss where and how to receive services, because these options can be important in determining the cost.
Share your financial mentor: Your mentor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your philanthropic options for long-term care may include a long-term insurance policy, an insurance policy of a combination of financial value to address these costs or to rely on your wealth - better you have money.
Use your legal papers: Share your legal cases early.
Get a representation of the medical service so that you can appoint someone you believe to manage your medical care and ensure that experts obey your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also, consider the lawyer's contribution to your money.
You should choose someone you believe in making financial decisions for you and guarantee your expenses are paid on time.
Don't forget the details: Think that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to go to the hospital.
You have the ability to answer questions about medicine and allergic reactions?
Keep this comment in a written arrangement to be ready.
"Not only money is involved, but who are doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the treatments?
Who will deal with the dog?
Set the plan properly."

State prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
New York prosecutors seek death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect of terrorist attacks in New York City which killed eight people—a rare penalty that has not been carried out in the state for national crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is allegedly using Home Depot's rental car to carry out an attack on a bicycle along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in his way in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "for purpose" killed eight victims and "for purpose" caused serious physical injuries, according to a report of the intention of seeking death penalty, released in the Southern District of New York.
All these errors carry the possibility of death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a panel of state judges issued a 22 lawsuit to Saipov which included eight charges of murder with fraudulent assistance, usually used by state prosecutors in criminal cases organized by charges of violence and traffic damage.
The attacks needed "to organize and be well prepared," prosecutors said, describing the act Saipov he acted to be "obscene, cruel and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, destruction, and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," a statement of will said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since New York's Southern District implemented death penalty charges.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to a life passage in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in the New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a husband and wife punished for death after being convicted of plotting to make a fan for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenberg were killed in death by being placed in the electric seat on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret day and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He explained to investigators that he felt better about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was moved to carry out the attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to charges.
He also requested to show ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the country's public advocates representing Saipov, said that they are "broken" by the prosecution decision.
"We think the decision to seek death penalty rather than accept guilty requests for imprisonment without the possibility of being released will only add to such events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov representation team originally asked prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to 'enforce the people' today during a protest at Tory conference.
Former Uup leader said politicians should 'feel heat' from anti-European citizens - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be the president of talks with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that England had 'should be out' at present as Mr. Farage would be Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces is the challenge of bringing together his very divided side when the supporters of Tory remained joined in different protests against Brexit in town.
The prime minister is working to implement his Checkers agreement plan with criticism from the supporters of Brexit, who support the European Union.
His members insisted that he would continue ahead and move to try to reach a consensus with Brussels despite the objection-and forcing anti-European Union and the Leba party to choose between his plan and 'obscenes'.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw off Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage had to be made an associate and was given the responsibility of the conversation with Brussels.
‘If he had control, we would be ready out now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we need to forget Checkers' plan.'
Showing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We didn't fight in the world war to pray under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone denied proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain not entirely true.'
'The Tory MP who supports Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in protest and told reporters: 'I just say: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
'The Checkers' plan is not very much popular with the public in general, Opposition cannot vote for it, is not expected by our party and our activists who actually go to the streets and help us be selected.
Please leave Checkers' plan and start listening to people.'
In a message directed to Mrs. May, he added: 'The Chiefs keep their positions when they keep their promises.'
Mr.Farage told the meeting that politicians should be made to ‘feel warm' if they are about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is about the issue of loyalty between us - people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we can't let him do it.'
In a message to a excited crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
'We inspire the army of the people of this country that will give us victory in Brexit and which will never rest until we are free, rely on ourselves, be proud England.'
Meanwhile, supporters continued protests through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Many activists showed banners written Tories against Brexit after the group's launch at the end of this week.
Leba MP Mr. Adonis mocked Conservatives for the security problems they had in the party program when the meeting was opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technologies of the United Kingdom Plan and the European Union to respect the laws of another, for a free trade without borders in Aylandi,' he added.
'It's a empty lie.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'look in detail' the intention of running for presidency,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he plans to "look deeply at the intention of running for presidency" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democratics spoke about his fate during the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is re-elected in November against GOP Geoff Diehl Representative, former chairman of Trump's campaign collaboration in Massachusetts.
He has been in the midst of rumors that he can deal with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the town hall structure since Trump was elected.
The audience asked him if he planned to run for presidency.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to reform our broken government, and that involves a woman in the top seat."

Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that one suspect has been arrested in connection with death by shooting LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at 5 a.m. ET at a meeting with reporters.
They had released a shooting video on Friday, asking for assistance to identify someone who appeared on video.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is about to win the world Cup after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since Valtteri Bottas won before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that team orders Mercedes would contribute to the major role in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas got a good start and almost completely left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two circuits and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel took the lead first and let Hamilton follow a friendly friend on the group's tail, something that had to contribute a lot.
Mercedes made one circuit behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed forward after a fierce race that made Ferrari driver leave the inner area free from the effect of closure after doing it twice in the third corner.
Max Verstappen began in the back line and was in seventh place for the end of the first round on his birthday to reach the age of 21.
He then led for a large part of the race and held and then passed Kimi Raikkonen and became fourth.
He eventually reached his repair area in the 14th round and failed to accelerate in the remaining eight circuits while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a strange job all wikendi and showed maturity to allow me to pass.
Team has done a special job to take first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was the Worst Language of the Body
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday about his insistence that he did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the selection of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at the West Virginia conference, the president did not directly discuss the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Court Committee, instead said that what is going on in the Senate showed that people "were selfish, bad and false."
"One thing that can happen and something good that has been going on a few days ago in the Senate, when you see angry and selfish and false people," he said.
"When you look at editions and revelations and then say" oh, I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal?
You remember his answer ... did you reveal the script - "oh, oh, what?
Ah no!
I didn't reveal it.
"Well, wait a minute.
Are we exposed ...No, we didn't reveal, "he added, in imitation of the senator.
Feinstein was used a letter describing charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was exposed in early September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr Ford's charges. I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it in secret as he requested."
But his revelations did not seem to be well received by the president, who commented during a Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you this, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the selection of the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democratics were using the allegations for their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see selfishness, evil, they don't care who they hurt, who have affected them to gain power and control, "Mediaite reported the President saying.

Air Friendship Control Dies while Confirming Hundreds of Travelers on Birds Can Avoid Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic control has been credited with being a hero after losing his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people has left safely.
More than 800 people have died and some have been lost after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Later vibrations continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in rubble in Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position at the Mutira Airport control tower Sis Al Jufri.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to fly safely.
He then flew the traffic control tower when he thought you were falling.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision was able to save hundreds of people, ABC News of Australia reported.
We provided helicopters from Balikpan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break down to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, leadership fears that the death toll can reach thousands and the country's disaster reduction organization has said that the reach of Donggala cities, Sig and Boutong are very small.
"The number is believed to be increasing as many bodies were still stuck under the falls as a challenge to reach many," the company's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugspirit said.
Six - foot - long waves have destroyed Palu that will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing help and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Small markets have been broken everywhere."
Jan Golfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help victims but we don't know how things are.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every transfer activity.
You're ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was beaten earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where over 550 people died.
The plane crashes Mikronesian: Air Niugini now says that one person has been lost after a plane crash within the deserters.
The airline that owned a plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now said that one person is not available, after which he had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a report that by Saturday afternoon, it was unable to know when he was one man.
The organization said it is collaborating with local leadership, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The organization did not immediately respond to more details regarding passengers, such as its age or nationalism.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.

"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through the sinking emergency doors of the plane.
He said flight attendants were afraid and shouted and that he suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. watermen said sailors working to improve piers by nearly also helped them rescue them with a breath boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres (30 m)

A critic shows a record of events in the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution unit finished describing his case on Saturday in a return case where a man charged with burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a professional witness in the field of mental analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used mobile phone records to connect together the activities of a 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, night of disaster.
Rowlett said he received local data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his previous claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
While data showed his mobile phone had Chambers' when he said he had his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
During the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Other words are that Tellis said he had known Chambers for just two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted a text message and a description of Chambers' communications from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be sent to a panel of judges later that day.

Another black man?!
New York home minister sues the couple for dismissal after a "discrimination" message
New York's home minister sues the couple for dismissing him on the grounds of discrimination after receiving a non-herent message from a mother who was complaining that he was "only another black man."
Marriagers refuse to be racists and represent the allegations to "defeated."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern after discovering that a new child service provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after his first working day in 2016.
"HAPANAA MAN MINGINE MAN," wrote Mrs. Plasco -Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After discovering his mistakes, Plasco -Flaxman with "unnerved" fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departure minister, African-American descent, had done a bad job and that instead he was expecting Filipino, according to New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day of work and was then returned to Uber's home.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation regarding dismissal and wants a $350 per day for the sixth month, for the work of living and working, though without contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't want to do such actions," he told Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied the claim that they are racist, saying that stopping Maurice's work was the right step, fearing they can't believe him again after he offended him.
"My wife had sent him a message he didn't intend'.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it's wrong?
Your baby?
Speak the truth."
Comparing the charges to "defeated," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had a child and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Will you go to ask such a man?
That's not a good thing to do," the bank investor said.
Although the legal case continues, the public opinion court has threatened the couple in social media, and attacked their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not prefer the talk bear, a new letter shows
Bend's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a bone after this book was accepted, said regarding the letter: "It is difficult to put himself in the shoes of someone who reads for the first time before publication.
It is very exciting to know about Paddington's great success."
Speaking his father, who worked as a camera attendant in the BBC before getting the urge to write a children's book from a small beary, would have no bad feeling for his work being rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes it as "a very important member of our family," he added that his father was very happy with his success.
"He was a man with little words and was not arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington was very important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington's success in such a way.
Although it was his architecture and ideas, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to take her over the phone.
After discovering that his daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad was calling from time to time and saying that the situation was very bad and was not expected to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me he would die within the next two minutes and I had to take good - bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi , I love you very much, my child.
I'll have you soon.
I'll have you.
The drugs that doctors had given him so that his spirit would continue to beat were slowly ending in his system.
He had died a while before and this move was just his system to stop working.
I just had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to give myself a heart.
"Last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently mourning losing his daughter, flew with other passengers - without them knowing what he was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I had bowed my head and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's when I was on board when I was in the plane when I felt so sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women mourn to keep cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones by committing suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on Welsh bridge with a message that strengthens and phone numbers that people can call.
His son Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from stress and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her child was a promising chef and a infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him with his smile.
Everyone said his smile was pleasing to all men."
However, he left work before dying, because he was" in a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to have his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "Daima I'm worried that this will affect others."
Mrs Davis created a card, "to let people know that there are people out there with whom you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old lover, not long after his mother's death.
He didn't say that he feels bad or is troubled by thought," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we discovered changes in his attitude.
He was down to Christmas Day - while children were opening their gifts he didn't want to look at them with eyes or communicate."
He said his death led to their getting it, but they must have struggled to continue life: "It puts a hole in the family.
It depresses us.
But we all must go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's sway as the FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked for - a time-long investigation, the climax of size - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "fall" due to the controversy of following.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Irish supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is from time.
The representatives' elections are held only five weeks from now, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Crepublicans are very defeated, then they will be very weak in their efforts to keep the person they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Maseta, convincing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in White House under Mr.Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI has released his report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Crepublicans and 49 Democratics work.
It is still unclear if Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, vice president, break uniforms and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees 'down' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un gained power seven years ago, South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean coalition ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest control in the border between North Korea and China and the high fines imposed on sale businesses were the main reason.
Pyongyang has not commented on the public.
Most of the North refugees are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the majority of the Army (almaraki DMZ) in the middle of the two Korean countries.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often brings them back with force.
Relations between North and South - who are literally still in war - have changed significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met Pyongyang for talks that focused on the discussion of the standing nuclear weapons.
This incident came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapoo, when they agreed on broad terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under that situation, no way we will remove nuclear weapons as the first," said Mr Ri in the speech of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "uncontrolable," and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi has said the selection of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "uncontrolable" person and said he has so much feelings that he is not worth serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were a woman he had ever done that way, they would say 'uncontrolable,'" Pelosi said about her response to the testimony of Kavanaugh before the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied allegations that he persecuted Dak Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During his opening report, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and breathing talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also made it clear to the Wademokrats on the committee, citing charges against him as "obscene and scheduled to destroy his reputation" organized by angry sympathy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was incapable of serving in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was prejudiced against the Wademokrats.
"I think he withdraws for those words and how he shocked Clinton's family and the Democratics," he said.
Pelosi did not refuse when asked if he tried to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Wademokrats were numerous in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then it's not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court when he is right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals. Circuit.
Pelosi added that if Sondemokrat was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Bei Nafuu Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his evidence charges, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he could change some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for an angry man, discrimination to go to the court and expect us to say, 'not that's weird,'" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It is a good review of the bitter, months and years of greater rage and cannot remove it without crying.
"We're crying when we're upset," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that it's normal, are you?"
He continued," I was very helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who also said she was crying when she got angry, but created a technique that meant that she was angry and started to cry, she could tell someone she was talking to," you might think I'm sad because I cried.
I'm upset."
He then went on to explain to me.
And I thought it was a good idea."
"The eyes are allowed as a way to remove rage because they are essentially unclear.
One of my memories I remember very much from my early career, is a office full of men, where I immediately found myself crying in an unwise rage, I was caught in the back of the neck by a big woman - a supervisor who was always a little afraid of me - who pulled me up to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because you and you."
Patricia Schroeder, then as a Democratic MP from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found to have a relationship outside of marriage in a boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Mrs. Schroeder, he was deeply disturbed and saw there is no reason to not think of holding the presidency.
"He wasn't a decision that made well," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
There was someone referring to this as a popular film "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign time grew so far, he was back in raising the fedh and thus vowed that he would not enter the race unless he contributed $2 million.
It was the war he was losing.
He found that some of his followers who donated $1,000 to men would give him only £250.
"Do they think that you don't get a price cut?" he wondered.
When he gave his speech to announce that he could not launch a formal campaign, he was filled with feelings of gratitude for people who helped him, confused with a system that made it very difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates and anger from gender discrimination until he was given breath.
"You would think that I had a nervous disorder," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media took the incident.
"You would think Kleenex were my business sponsors.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my grave?
"He cried"?".
How trade wars between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
The first voices in the trade war between the United States and China were very disturbing and although the war will not soon end, the difference between countries may be useful to Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese sales including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most influential difference began this week with a new tax affecting $200 billion (150 billion), thus taxing half of all products entering the United States from China.
Beijing has always retaliated, has recently placed a five to ten percent tax for $60 billion of U.S. products.
China has promised to have the US action, and the second largest economic country does not seem to be desperate at any time soon.
Making Washington changes means you should accept terms, but publicly accepting American pressure will be a great embarrassment to Xi Jinping, president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, the problems of trade war against the United States can help China for a long time by reducing the support between the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin to change in economics in any country between it and more dangerous than others previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who is considering Asia at the new U.S. Security Consultance Center.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria has said it is ready for a voluntary return to refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country destroyed by a long-term war of over seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Kad al- Moualem said the situation in the country is being established.
"Today the reality is more stable and safe due to the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to return regularly.
All conditions are now voluntary return to refugees in the country that they had to escape due to terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and their jobs.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al- Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the damaged country.
But he insisted that they do not want assistance on terms or assistance from countries that funded the terrorism.
Europe wins Ryder Paris Cup
The European team has won the Ryder 2018 Cup after winning the American team with the last 16.5 score against 10.5 on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown as the captain of the Denmaki Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time throughout the tournament, hit his first ball in water in the 16th pit of 3 holes, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his turns and became 1 player out of 4 to 5–0 since the current racing design began in 1979.
American Jordan Spiith failed 5 and 4 by the player listed below in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmaki.
The player listed first place in the world, Dustin Johnson, fails 2 and 1 and Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The player in Ryder's eight eight-yards, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the tournament with 20.5 points in his games.
"It's not my usual crying but today I've been sold.
It has been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for selecting me and believing me.
I'm very happy, I'm glad to win the cup again.
The key is the team and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
He transfers roles to his fellow citizen John Ram who defeated the American star Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I feel a strange pride, defeating Tiger Woods, I was watching him young," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13–21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising figure from one of the highest players ever existed, after winning 14 titles and being only second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was overwhelmed with all wikend to put the ball in the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the highest level game in all races.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the lower game of his squad, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning where we presented many challenges to the European team.
We fought.
Great respect for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will reorganized, I will work with our American PGA league and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will continue ahead.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud of being captain.
You must give commendation.
They controlled us."
