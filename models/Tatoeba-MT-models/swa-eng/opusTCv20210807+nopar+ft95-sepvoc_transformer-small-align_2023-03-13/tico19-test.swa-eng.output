The rapid rise in cases of koronavirus (COVID-19) in the European/Eneo Economic Union of Europe and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The total incidence of koronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows a Romance in the European Union/Eneo Economic states of Europe and the United Kingdom to prove that, at different levels based on the country involved, the COVID-19 disaster continues to grow rapidly throughout countries.
According to the situation in Italy, nations, hospitals and critical care units should increase their condition of being ready for the increase in COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and especially critical conditions.
On 31 December 2019, a group of cases whose sources are unknown were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the cause of the disease as a new korona virus that is now known as serious asthma problems that are the sever accute respirary syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is named after koronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence available to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have an average condition of illness, namely asthma or without pneumonia and many of them recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 grows with a more serious condition that requires a person to be admitted to home home while 6% of the remaining cases of critical condition requiring critical treatment.
The death rate of patients admitted from COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluate the total events of COVID-19 in every European/Eneo Economic Union (EU/EEEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared to conditions in Hubei County, China.
We also compared the current COVID-19 cases in EU/EEEA and the UK UK to the number in Italy from 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEEA and England nations
After China, COVID-19 spread into geographic areas and issues of COVID-19 disaster in other parts of the world are currently following those of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a major disaster.
In the 5 March edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiri et al. reported on the first confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the description of the case according to WHO.
In the EU/EEEA, the first three Vvisa confirmed were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among the returning people from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been discovered in all 30 EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom (UK), where between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Finding a total number and total events of COVID-19 cases
At the European Disease Control and Control Center (ECDC), an informed number of COVID-19 cases in every country around the world, found from any official sources such as WHO, is daily transferred at 8:00 a.m.
These documents were used for reviewing current COVID-19 issues in the EU/EEEA and UK, compared them to Italians.
As part of the existing COVID-19 cases, we calculated a total of COVID-19 events in 14 reduced days, thus considering the original source of COVID-19, in every EU/EEEA and England, in the period of 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the total number of informed cases of each country by 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to that of Italy for the period starting on 31 January–15 March 2020.
Current issues about COVID-19 in EU/EEEA and England countries
Current issues in COVID-19 cases in 14 days reduced in EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom generally followed those of Hubei County (China) (Photo 1).
For EU/EEEA and England in general, a total of COVID-19 events began to rise on 21 February and increased further on 28 February 2020 (the extra text).
This was further conducted by the increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but throughout EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom countries showed issues of increased COVID-19 events (an additional text).
Photo 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEEA and UK countries compared to that of Italy for 31 January-15 March 2020.
It shines that, by 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEEA and England countries already reported the total number of cases compared to that of Italy in the first 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of informed COVID-19 cases is increasing in the EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom.
The issues seen in the total COVID-19 events suggested that this major disaster is increasing at a rate that can be compared throughout countries.
This is despite different countries being in different levels, different in how every public health faces the possibility of different definitions of cases in the country and different options of selecting patients who must be read for COVID-19 confirmation, including people's testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian areas described the situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed deep treatment and news sources reported that hospitals and critical care units were already full of polymons.
Data about the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospital or intensive care unit is currently available to EU/EEEA level for 6% and 1% of the cases of monk (data has not been shown).
However, they should be collected in a special order to be used along with current data of the study that highlights the number of cases reported by the death toll.
Research conducted 2010-11 showed significant differences in access to critical and moderate medical beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have fewer or more resources than Italy (the feeding areas of people in critical condition and average treatment 12.5 per 100,000 in 2010–11).
The conditions related to the concentration of medical care, with estimates of each EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom of people with COVID-19 hospitalized with a risk of 90% passing the capacity of beds available to care for people in critical condition, are presented in the sixth review of the rapid risk of COVID-19.
Since cases are currently included in certain areas in EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and care units in critical condition usually care for a specific number area, information about cases and beds of the concentration of people in critical condition should be found in the numerals for the 2nd (NUTS-2).
The situation in Italy and the current issues in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom.
The country, hospitals and critical care units should prepare for the continued conditions of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in COVID-19 patients in need of treatment and especially the medical treatment of people in critical condition, such as taking place in the affected areas of Italy.
As suggested in a recent assessment of ECDC's high risk, a rapid trend, involving people and todoti is important in delaying SARS-COV-2, with changes from the control attitude to counter, as the expected increase of the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and set their strategies to deal with them if they do not carry it accordingly early.
A review of immediate risk also lists public health measures to deal with the impact of a major disaster.
There is a small opportunity where countries have the ability to increase their control efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 and lower pressure on treatment.
Failure to do so, there is a possibility of other EU/EEEA health systems facing an increase in patients needing deep treatment within the future or weeks.
The outbreak of the korona 2019virus (COVID-19), caused by serious asthma problems that is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus killing over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and kwigineko in the world, causing disaster to humans.
Like similar viruses, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS among people's dead in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through the same route.
However, COVID-19 has less aggressive and death rates than SARS but greater ability to be transmitted and infect older people than young and more women.
In dealing with the increased number of publications on this emerging disease, this article is trying to provide a timely inspection and a review of this fast-run research subject.
We will address fundamental issues about epidemiology, biology, biology, studies, medicine, its sources and prevention of disease.
Although there are still other questions that need to be answered, we hope that this inspection will help in understanding and eliminate this frightening illness.
Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has been an unexpected memory for all Chinese who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday period and for weeks later due to the re-existing of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the korona virus (CoV) which caused the re-influence of asthma problems that is the sever acute respirary syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization named SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020 and related disease was named after CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
This massive tragedy began in Wuhani, China and spread rapidly across the country and about 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, these viruses have caused 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients being accepted home and over 3,000 farewell to the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "an enemy number 1 public" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nh.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19 including biobiology, epidemology, biology, studies and treatment since the first report on 7 January, 2020 which noted a series of viral separation from many patients.
This inspection is trying to summarize the development of research in the new rapidly growing subject.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS with another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respirary syndrome (MERS, and re-election in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of illness as well as some of the questions yet to be answered.
CoV Japanese virus has been considered a non-human virus, which primarily causes about 15% of the common flu 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered the most widely distributed human CoV, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the re-election in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, monk, and soon spread rapidly in many other nations with a high level of illness and death rates.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 re-election is the third CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Photo 1,1, pneumonia conventions whose roots were not known were first reported from Wuhani on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission in China.
Seven days later, the CoV pick was launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first worst episode from Wuhani was reported.
Currently, this disaster spread rapidly in neighboring towns, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the release among medical providers was reported, and indicate that human transmission to humans was possible.
On 23 January, regular operations in Wuhani were closed and public transportation was discontinued.
On 24 January, the first medical research on the disease was reported, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had directly touched the Wuhan sea food market that was considered to be a location where the infection began from the source of an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared this delay to be a global health emergency.
By the time of the publication of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries worldwide (Photo.2).
As the situation continues to grow, the final and the effect of this re-existing is still unclear.
Meno on 11 February 2020, a study of 8,866 patients' stations including 4,021 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 presented a more inspired image of this tragedy as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 virus affected people of all ages, but most of them between 30–65 years.
About half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, few were under 20 and only 14 people were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 affected more men (0.31/1000,000) than (0.27/1000,000).
COVID-19 expanded into groups especially in and near Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average number of 5 days (2–9) from the beginning of the investigation.
The average period of his release was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
The average period from him to death was 9.5 days (4.8–13).
The primary number of generation (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the majority of transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate of patients confirmed to have cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%), and the changed rate of patients' deaths was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
Three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (mme), age (=60), and the bad condition of pneumonia.
CoV is a small family of large and integrated viruses with one RNA pick.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, where alpha-and CoV betas are known to infect humans.
The glycoprotin (S) connects its angiotensini cells that change enzaim 2 (ACE2) and the dimptdyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, monk and then the membrane combination occurs.
The RNA virus is released on the saitoplasim; after the production of a virus genome, the genome RNA with the glaikoprotonis attached to nucleapsid proteins to create co-operation, which is then connected to plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 series was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new beta-CoV with over 99.98% of the electronic identity among the 10 subsequent samples collected from the natural area of this rebound, the Huanan Seafood market of Wuhani.
SARS-CoV-2 virus is much more similar to SARS-CoV kigenic than MERS-CoV.
Through electronic distribution, SARS-CoV-2 pieces were found in the narrowest components of the human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to be SARS-CoV-2's review similar to SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein connects to the human ACE2 in a weaker way than SARS-CoV, which is accompanied by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 virus combines the worst condition of infection for patients compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create a new short protein with a code orf3b and a protein produced with a code orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b-CoV-2 can take place in the condition of the virus causing the disease and preventing the appearance of IFNć; however, orf8 has nothing known to work.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and his colleagues, reported the cryo-EM structure of the full length of the human ACE2 as a 2.9 Å for integration and amino transport B0AT1.
They found that the sequence, which had a clear side and a line-up tie, was collected as two molecules and the ACE2-B0AT1 can connect two S proteins, which gives evidence of awareness and CV's transmission.
B0AT1 may be a medical target for a study of SARS-CoV-2.
Chief and central virus carrier
It has been known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have roots from bats and were distributed to humans through the cat ngawa and camels, monk.
Through the SARS-CoV-2 comparison and other CoV, bats were considered to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers as these viruses are similar to 96% and CoVV similar to SARS from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the middle carrier who helped this virus move to humans from the barrier of the animal is still unknown and the method of its distribution has not yet been confused.
Ji and his colleagues, recommended snakes to be viral carriers from bats to humans involving re-consolidation in S protein.
According to some research, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that a long - noseed brother, ant-eating animals that have served Japanese as a Chinese medicine - are more likely to carry SARS-CoV-2 virus according to 99% of the geoscopic homoji in CoV discovered within the brother and SARS-CoV-2.
However the difference of 1% of the two genomes is still a great difference; thus, perfect results for solid evidence are still awaiting (Photo 33).
SARS-CoV-2 qualities are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can grow into 48 hours of measurement in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%–50% of the humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same reputation.
SARS-CoV-2 is reportedly affected by the verviolet rays and the 56 °C temperature for 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethanol, a cleaner containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other oil solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively maim this virus.
All humans are generally defenseless against SARS-CoV-2 and are thus at risk of obtaining these new viruses.
Currently, no detailed research has reported on body defense confrontations against SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to the original research on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Photo.4).
In general, after the virus invades the carrier, they are first recognized by the non-living immune system of the carrier through the receivers of the pattern (PR) including C-type's eccles, Toll's anti-TRR, NOD (NLR), and RIG-I-I (RLR).
Through different ways, viruses cause the presence of elements that cause tissue burns, the development of dendraiti cells and the production of the I interferons (IFNs) protein that controls the spread of viruses and accelerates the production of viral proteins.
However, SARS-CoV's N protein can help the virus avoid the edge of the immune system.
Soon, the body’s immunity joins in fighting viruses.
White T blood cells including CD4+ and CD8+ T cell may play an important role in protecting the body.
T cells of CD4+ stimulate B cells to produce antibodi cells facing specific viruses and the T CD8+ cells become cells directly affected by viruses.
T helmer cells produce sytokin molecules that help burn conditions to help protect cells.
However, CoV can prevent the performance of T cells by causing the execution of T cells.
Human defense including guerrillas such as C3a and C5a and various antibodis are also important in coping with viral infection.
For example, antibodis released to a recovered patient destroyed MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, when the immune system produces excessive antibodi can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in worse circumstances, many organs are unable to function and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, originally reflected are more likely to affect older people with other diseases and pregnant women.
It is common that for people in danger of getting a large number of viruses or whose immune system is weak, they have a greater chance of infection by others.
The average average period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1–14 days, often 3–7 days according to a study of the first 425 cases at Wuhani.
However, a study on 1,099 cases shows that his period was 3 days on average and was between 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study as described above shows that the period was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2) according to the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the time of the karantin according to the same period of recovery, thus preventing infected people who do not show signs to distribute viruses to others.
As a common act, people at risk or infected with viruses are usually required to be in karantin for 14 days.
Should the karantin time be extended to 24 days?
High body temperature is the main and often early COVID-19 symptom, which can be followed by the absence of symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, respiratory difficulty, muscle pain, knife, headache, irritation, flu, chest pain, driving, gum and vomiting.
Some patients had difficulty breathing and/or low air levels in the body at the beginning of the disease.
In the worst condition, patients continued to have serious respiratory problems, resulting in a condition that causes the body’s organs to function, too much acid in the body and the blood condition of the blood failure to freeze.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of asthma and high fever, even without respiratory problems should be tested by viruses in early studies.
A biographic study at the end of December 2019 showed a percentage of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for a dry cough, 55% for difficulty breathing and 3% by driving; 8% of patients who needed the assistance of breathing machines.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of family sample and a sample caused by someone who did not show symptoms of illness.
Comparison, biographic research in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and difficulty breathing (5%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed breathing machines, than COVID-19 patients and this is married to MERS' aggressive condition than COVID-19.
Driving (26%) and throat to bite (21%) also appeared among MERS patients.
For SARS patients, it has been revealed that high body temperature (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-7%), respiratory difficulty (40%-42%), operating (20–25%) and the throat to bite (13–25%) were the main symptom and respiratory aid machines were needed for 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Compared, SARS's death rates by November 2002 were 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to biographic research in June 2012, death rates were 37% of 2,94 confirmed cases.
Former research reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high at 6.47 at a rate of 95% of accuracy (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, death rates and R0 are shown on the 1.1th Jeddi Jeddi.
The above statistics show that SARS-CoV-2 have the highest spread to the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but its edge is lower than two other hivos.
So there is a major challenge to control SARS-CoV-2's major disaster than to control MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
When it arises at the beginning, it is often held in a similar family or from a convention or car like a ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhani or other affected areas or contact with people or patients affected in the past two weeks before starting.
However, it has been reported that people can carry this virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who recovered were allowed to return home can carry this virus again, giving caution to be increased for the time of the katanti.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white side blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the original phase.
For example, the decline of white blood cells › 4&109/L including the number of lymphocyte › 1&109/L and the ratings of aminotransferase and viremia were available to 1,099 patients of COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle and myglobin increased in the blood of some patients and C-reactive protein and the cleaning of erythrocyte increased in the blood of many patients.
For patients with cases of poor conditions, D-dimer level, the devalue product of fibroin in the blood, was raised and the number of lymphocyte continued to decline.
Unusual conditions in chest measurements were available to many COVID-19 patients and the conditions included shadows of two routes or the closing of the lungs so that they cannot be seen.
Patients often have no unusual pneumonia, serious lung injury and serious respiratory problems that are acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
From ARDS, uncontrolled burns, liquid gathering and continuing vascular swelling are in serious conflict with gas interaction.
The failure of the type-I and type-II air cuts reduces the shock rates of liquid products and increases local shock rates, thus reducing the risk of the lungs to expand and put more risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the effects of the worst chest conditions are parallel to the worst rate of illness.
On February 18, 2020, the first biophysic analysis of COVID-19 signaled the inclusion of the inner parts of the lungs, the structure of hypoline, the entry of the lymphocytes in the body through the trails and cells of multi-specifics in the lungs of the mgnjwa who died from this disease, in comparison with the pathology of viral and ARDS and the same as the SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the reverse-transcriptase polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as a primary process of COVID-19 testing.
However, due to the high rate of current cases of disease not being found through measurement, which can spread this tragedy, medical signals began to be used for testing (which no longer depends on RT-PCR only) in China on 13 February 2020.
The same situation also occurred through SARS testing.
Therefore, the total history of illness, medical manifestations, experiments in romance and radio-based effects are important and suitable for making effective measurements.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang described the process of using the SHERLOCK strategy based on CRISPR to discover SARS-CoV-2, which discovers the RNA pieces of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 › 10–18 mul/L to 200 › 10–18 mul/L (link 10–18 mul/L (link 10-100 per small litre) using a metal to drop less than an hour without needing a tool for a combination.
We hope that this new technique can improve in a unique way of importance and ease if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of new CoV experience, medical professionals can provide assistance treatment for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of treatments that have previously been used or proposed to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other types of viral diseases (Medita (Pedili).
These treatments include modern and possible treatment and drugs are fighting viruses, immune tapes, steroids, plasma from patients who recovered, pharmaceutical and psychological aid from China.
Even plasma from patients recovered was recommended for treatment.
Drug products companies are struggling to create antibodi and vaccines against these viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks other organs that show ACE2 although at a low rate, such as the gas and kidney gut system.
Despite this, the absence of asthma and fucking methods is the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is necessary to relieve pain and save lives and includes conventional air therapy, clean air flow, help to breathe without using a side machine and helped breathe with a side machine based on the condition of the disease.
Patients with a severe asthma condition must be helped through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the cardiopulmonary method used in heart failure or asthma method that is dangerous.
Also, maintaining the level of electrolyte, preventing and treating the second-class and non-work and the protection of key organs is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is also known that the saitokini explosion comes from the patient's immune system to provide over-defense antibodi to fight SARS and MERS.
The sytokini explosion is a form of a burning system confrontation that involves the release of the sytokini picks including TNFō, IL-1ō, IL-2, IL-6, IFNō, IFNō, IFNō and MCP-1.
These Cytokines incorporate immune cells to release a large number of independent functions that are the main source of the ARDS and the organs often die.
The suppression of the immune system is essential to the treatment of the sytokini explosion, especially for patients in poor condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an antibodi fighting the IL6 of one oak, have been used to treat the saitokini explosion.
Other protective treatment for the sytokini explosion includes the control of the immune system directed by the T cell; the IFN-ō, IL-1, and TNF; the prevention of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokinine signaling 4; and HDAC restrictions.
Steroids, as immune agents, were used extensively in SARS treatment to reduce the effects of burn damage.
However, the top steroids were not beneficial for a serious lung injury to SARS patients and COVID-19.
Rather, they can cause serious side effects, especially bone anemia affected significant diagnosis.
Despite this, small corticosteroids levels of low-to average doz have been proposed to be used properly to treat patients in poor COVID-19 condition.
By the time of writing an article, there is no effective treatment against a virus that has been confirmed.
However, the injection of remdesivir injected into the veins, which is a sugar-free nucleotide and fosfeti, has been found to be a faf for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new anti-virus drug originally created by Gilead for Ebola-related treatment and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also showed preventing the possibility of other same-speed RNA viruses including MERS and SARS virus.
On these grounds, Gilead has released the drug to China to conduct a pair of experiments for people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and events are very expected.
Moreover, baricitinb, interferon-ō, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interestvirin have been proposed as possible treatments for patients with symptoms of serious respiratory problems.
Driving, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other serious conditions can occur following the total treatment and lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments and other drugs used for patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from patients who recovered from antibodi production
Blood collection from patients who recovered from infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from similar illness or to protect health workers from illness has a long history.
Indeed, patients who recovered often have high levels of antibodi compared to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodi is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other foreign objects and recognize special molecules on germs and fight them directly.
Due to this, plasma collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 served to stab 10 patients in extreme condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, including the decline in burns and viral levels and improved by the burning of fresh air in the blood.
However, confirmation and definition are necessary to recommend the use of large levels before specific treatments are created.
Also, when medical effects are reflected, some of the limitations associated with plasma should be taken into account.
For example, antibodis can stimulate the immune system to pass revenge and cause the sytokin to be produced, which is likely to have a life threatening waste.
An antibodi in the blood is low and the plasma need is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to create and produce specific antibodis faster to fight the global disaster.
It is thus more important to release B cells from patients who recovered and identify the geotic synopsis that extracts an antibodi fat or to investigate the search for an antibod fat against important virus protein.
In this way, we can raise antibodi production.
TCM has also been used to treat China’s disease for many years.
However, its effects are largely based on the inclusion of many ingredients on a different form based on the study of illness according to TCM theories.
Most fafus are still unknown or unclear as it is difficult to cool and prove such ingredients or their best inclusions.
Currently, due to lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has been one of the main alternative treatments for patients with poor and moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from the worst stage.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing pills were found to be treating COVID-19 effectively.
High medical standards in COVID-19 patients were observed in many provinces in China using TCM to treat 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), With Hubei province, where TCM was used for only about 30% of their COVID-19 patients, had the lowest medical rate for (13%).
However, this is a superficial comparison because other patterns of effects such as the number and condition of patients should be included in assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and co-founders published a study of comparing western medicine (WM) alone and the total of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time needed by restoring body temperature, loss of symptoms and hospital admission decreased significantly in the WM+TCM group than the WM only group.
The best results are that, the rates of condition of patients with symptoms being worse (from weak to worse conditions) decreased significantly to the WM+TCM group than to the WM group only (7.4% v 46.2%) and death rates were reduced in the WM+TCM group only (8.8% against 39%).
Despite this, TCM's efficiency and security are still waiting for better controlled tests in larger levels and in more stations.
It will be interesting to give credit to the process of action and to expose the benefits of TCM treatment or their inclusion if possible.
The suspected or confirmed patients have COVID-19 often experience the fear of this highly infectious disease and even kill people, and people in the karantin are also going through fatigue, loneliness and anger.
Despite this, symptoms of exposure such as high body temperature, lack of sufficient air in body organs and coughs as well as severe side effects such as sleeplessness caused by reduced body burns can cause anxiety and stress.
In the original phase of SARS, various mental problems involving extreme stress, anxiety, attacks of fear, mental excitement, symptoms of mental disorders, mental harassment and even life - giving were reported.
Tracking people who touched the necessary karantin, as part of public health response to COVID-19, can make people more nervous and antibiotics about the effects of infection, karantin and stigma about family and friends.
Thus, mental health therapy should be given to COVID-19 patients, suspects and people who have contact with them as well as the general public they need.
The psychological support should be included in the creation of various mental health teams, open communication and frequent information that is correct about SARS-CoV-2 and medical programs and use of professional electronic devices and programs to avoid contact with others.
A good vaccine is important in interrupting the distribution process from animals and humans infected with endangered people and are used as well as treatment against viruses in controlling major disasters caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been set to create S protein vaccines to produce a strong and long-term and/or body protection protection against SARS-CoV.
The vaccines from a severely reduced virus have been assessed in animal structures for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines for older people and the structures of their standards to kill viruses and anti-human virus protection is still defined before medical research was introduced.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new transmission has been reported since then.
In comparison, cases and convention here and there of MERS continue to take place in the Middle East and spread in other areas due to animal sources in areas witnessing the spread of disease.
The vaccines are designed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA platinum, viral currents, small particles, viral particles, virus-like particles and small protein units that are reunited with others have been assessed in animal structures.
The development of safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for people with no immune system is an emergency and vital responsibility for controlling this ongoing disaster.
However, there is a challenge to overcome this challenge due to the long-term needed (on average 18 months) to create various vaccines and changing aspects of CoV.
As a new illness, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest themselves perfectly to treatment for thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients can recover slowly without the condition of the previous illness.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high risk of illness and death rates for patients with poor condition.
Therefore, developing a structure based on medical experience for illness is important for health medical organizations to give priority to their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to medical research reported so far, these patterns can affect or be associated with COVID-19's existence for patients (the 33rd Edition):
Age: Age was an important model in studying SARS, which is also a fact in COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily occurred extensively for people aged 30–65 with 47.7% of the patients with over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed deep treatment were more likely to have another condition of illness and problems and were older than those who did not have it (at the average age of 66 against 51) and indicate age as a model of COVID-19 patients' results.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men than women (0.31/100,000 against 0.27/1000,000), as described above.
Disease and early health conditions: Patients with COVID-19 who needed treatment are likely to be infected with a serious heart and heart failure.
Heart events were also the main cause of deaths for SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also connect to the cells of the ACE2-polative bag, which can lead to non-work for COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that age and chronic diseases have serious relationships and can interfere.
The unusual effects of romance. The C-reactive protein level (CRP) within the blood reflects the condition of burns or tissue injuries and have been proposed as a pattern of recovery, a condition of receiving medicine and healing eventually.
The relationship between CRP levels and weight and recovery capacity from COVID-19 has also been proposed.
Also, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine ause (CK) can also help predict the results.
These Enzaims are manifest one in abundance within many body organs, especially within the heart and liver and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, it is the traditional signs of heart failure or liver failure.
Main medical symptoms: chest testing and temporary development of medical symptoms should be considered as well as other issues for the forecast of results and COVID-19 problems.
The use of steroids: described above, steroids are immune agents that are widely used as additional treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the rate of burn damage.
Since the high-profile treatment that reduces the burnout of organs was widely used for SARS patients, many victims suffered from lack of blood in bones and long-term disabilities and poor living conditions.
Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used for lower and short-term COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As described above, during COVID-19 many patients suffered from unusual stress as they endured long periods of karantin and enthusiasm and saw the deaths of close family members and their patients.
It is important to offer psychological advice and long - term assistance to help patients recover from stress and refer to the normal state of life.
According to biographic research so far, COVID-19 appears to have a bio-specific components different from SARS.
Despite the production in the lower respiratory method, SARS-CoV-2 can be produced in the upper part of the method of breathing effectively and causing moderate symptoms or not showing any symptoms in the original phase of the infection, similar to other CoV virus that causes severe fever.
Therefore, infected patients in the early phase or the period of the treatment can produce a large amount of viruses during daily activities, causing great difficulty with the control of the disaster.
However, SARS-CoV distribution was considered to be done when patients are very ill, although much distribution was not done in the early phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 rebound is worse and difficult to control than SARS's re-election.
Great efforts are currently going on in China including the closure of regular operations in Wuhan and nearby towns and developing karantin for almost all people in hopes of interrupting SARS-CoV-2 distribution.
Although these measures have been damaging the economy in a bad way and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining and indicates the decline of this disaster.
Estimates of more hope are that this delay will end by March and the phase of its impact will last 3–4 months.
Some experts, however, are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and his colleagues, estimated that COVID-19, which is primarily seen more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and his colleagues, formed a process of predicting the outcome of this disaster and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 virus may infect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in air current measurements and throat of patients who recovered and from hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that new identified viruses could be of re-existing periods such as influenza.
However, the signs of hope have occurred in China on the basis of the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases and deaths of half a million people.
However, through the strict principle of karantin and isolated people, the disease is eventually controlled.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be weak in the process and eventually die or have a low rate of infectious viruses and whether available among humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 disaster with the SARS and MERS is presented below (Photo.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is further distributed through cough or sneezing and can also be spread through direct contact with viral equipment.
This virus was also found in feces that trigger new possibilities of distribution from feces to mouth.
Recent research for 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by hospital interference, including 17 patients with other early diseases and 40 medical service providers.
Therefore, a great caution should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, community workers, family members, co-founders and even other people who touch patients or infected people.
The first defensive action that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing face blessings; using medical and N95's anti-specifics to help asthma (the # 1860) edition helps control the spread of the virus.
Medical surfaces prevent drops of liquids from a potentially infected person against being transported to air or stuck in the product areas, where they can pass on to other people.
However, the N95 only (the # 1860) edition can protect against breathing within small germs even by 10 to 80 nm measurements, with 5% of the germs being able to penetrate perfectly; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and is about 85 nm.
Since small pieces can infiltrate even five of the set-ups, health providers who touch each other with patients must wear N95 (the # 1860) edition but not medical land.
Along with the mainland, healthcare providers should wear beds with necessary components to expand further contact with viruses.
Viruses can also affect people through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore N95; viruses may have entered his body through his burning eyes.
Thus, healthcare providers should also wear visual masks or glasses while caring for patients.
In total public areas in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with more cleaning soap than usual, try to stay at home with private katas and reduce contact with people who may be infected.
Three terms are considered to be the right distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 virus came as a new virus to the human world, its similarities to SARS-CoV as it was passed on 7 January 2020 would have to give great caution to China due to their memory of the 2003 SARS leak.
However, it was until 19 January 2020 where Wuhan's director of Wuhan Center comforted citizens by saying that these new viruses have low levels of infection and low production capacity from person to person and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
This message greatly reduced public concerns, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and failed to cope with the disease while it was not more widespread Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can regret this and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be (1) more careful when making public ads because each word has meaning for the public and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more careful and take action on unusual information from clinics than to wait to receive official reports from doctors or officials; (3) put further restrictions to control the possibility of a disaster in its original phase than trying to comfort the public and (4) the mra occasionally to provide more effective tests to increase public awareness of disaster diseases and try to improve the social response system over time.
COVID-19 outbreak caused by new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, illness has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world by this time we write.
Since these viruses are very similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms are also equal between COVID-19 and SARS, COVID-19 has caused the concept of the re-existing SARS.
However, there are some fundamental differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in controlling this tragedy and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and men more than women and its weight and death rates are higher among older people than young people.
SARS causes deaths by higher percentage than COVID-19 (10.91% against 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients are spreading viruses even when they do not show any symptoms while SARS patients are doing so in a very bad condition, causing more difficulty in controlling COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains on the side why SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly and in a wider area than SARS-CoV.
The usual SARS-CoV-2 RNA test can occur negatively for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients treated can be found again with this virus.
These results increase the risk of viral spread.
Due to the rapid continued research on COVID-19, many important issues are still not resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although the 96% electronic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-based SARS-based CoVs, we cannot still conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from bats.
Which animal was the middle to carry and distribute viruses from natural virus carrier, for example from bats to humans?
Unaware of #1 and 2, we cannot effectively interrupt distribution and this re-existing can occur again at any time.
Although the molecular structures and biochetic experiments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 you don't dream and become ACE2, are these viruses not known to enter the cells of the respiratory method and cause the following biological changes?
Do these viruses also connect cells featuring ACE2- in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach quick and accurate tests and effective treatment.
How long will this tragedy last?
How do these viruses grow in the process of human distribution?
Will you be a global disaster, you will die like SARS or occur again in time such as colds?
It's important but you can take time to find answers to the questions above and many other questions.
However, despite its cost, we have to stop this tragedy as soon as possible and restore life to normal.
The origin of human koronavirus diseases
Physical changes and environmental conditions have contributed to the growth of the korona virus (CoVs) and its carriers, including humans for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) virus was known to cause severe illness, such as common fever.
The outbreaks of severe respiratory sindrom (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory sindrom (MERS) have changed things and demonstrated how HCoV's infection can be dangerous and threatening life.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has caused the Cos virus to be re-existed and surprised us with its high potential for spread but reduced the condition of causing disease compared to the SARS-CoV virus.
HCoV infections are derived from animals and understand the nature of HCoV's infection from animals can help us.
Most HCoV virus came from bats where they were unable to cause disease.
The middle carriers of some HCoV are also known.
Recognizing a carrier is directly involved in preventing human diseases.
A study of the CoV carrier's interaction with animals can also do much to gain vital awareness of CoV's ability to cause disease among humans.
In this inspection, we submit a summary of the knowledge that exists about seven types of HCoV, by highlighting the history of its discovery as well as its source on animals and its spread from one species of animal to another.
Very important, we compare to distinguish different types of HCoV from the view of viral conversion and re-enforcement of tooth.
The current CoV 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Also, the demand for success in the change of carrier and the effect of viral growth on the weight of the disease has also been reflected.
The koronavirus (CoV) is derived from the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of linked viruses, with a positive sense and a single RNA.
This virus with a larger tooth of 26 to 32 kilograms among RNA viruses was called "CoVs" from their crown form under electronic investigation.
Kimundo, CoV virus has genomes that do not have the same-organized components.
About two thirds of the tooth have two large frames open (ORF1a and ORF1b), changing into a p1a protein and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Poliprotin is further cut off to produce 16 non-specific proteins, which were killed as nsp1~16.
The rest of the tooth contains the ORF of the protein of the model, including spin (S), envelope (E), membreni (M) and nukleoprotin (N).
A number of specific proteins are sung by different generations of CoV.
According to differences in protein picks, CoV virus is classified in four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), between them, beta-CoV genera virus has more HCoV virus and has divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Archaeological evidence has shown that bats and weed animals serve as sources of alpha-CoV gene and beta-CoV, with birds being the main conservationists of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV virus has continued to exceed animal barriers and some have emerged as major causes of human mangonjw.
To this day, there are seven types of CoV virus (HCoV) known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 is alpha-CoV.
Five other types of beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, koronavirus (SARS-CoV) of high respiratory risk, koronavirus of Middle Eastern respiratory sindrom (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 often cause moderate symptoms, such as common fever and/or operating.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV virus, MERS-CoV and newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 are germs with high risk of causing disease, resulting in poor infections in a low respiratory method for more patients with a higher risk of developing sindromu of severe respiratory problems (ARDS) and non-specific problems.
The first type of HCoV-229E, B814, was released from the nose fluids of patients with a common fever in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was collected through a comprehensive study of HCoV-229E virus and HCoV-OC43 virus, all of which cause symptoms of personal weakness.
In fact, the concept had been accepted among many that HCoV's attacks are generally harmless until SARS's rebound occurred.
The 2003 SARS pandemic is one of the worst leaks in current history, infecting over 8,000 people with a bad death rate for about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle Eastern sindrom virus (MERS) caused a ongoing disaster in the Arab Peninsula while spreading other parts of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing korona 2019 virus (COVID-19), which has killed over 3,120 people and infected over 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
A caution has existed with the world must provide for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 disaster.
All seven HCoV viruses are native to bats, rats or domestic animals.
Many evidence details support the nature of the growth of all HCoV viruses from bats, where viruses are common and are unable to cause disease but show the condition of the geotic execution.
COVID-19 has presented major medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges in China and the world.
Tracking HCoV's source from animals provides a process of understanding natural history, motivation and prevention patterns of disease spread between species.
This can also lead or enable conservation search, middle carriers and carriers who distribute SARS-CoV-2, with the effect of extreme prevention in the future.
In this inspection we submit a summary of the nature of animals, distribution among the species of animals and HCoV's ability to cause disease.
Hususan, we light and discuss the common subject that HCoV virus is usually unable to cause disease within its natural carriers but are able to cause illness after distribution between species to new carriers.
We also check the current issues of HCoV growth where the increase in infectious ability is often accompanied by reduced risk of disease.
The results of the ongoing SAR-CoV-2 re-existing have also been discussed in this context.
CoV animal virus has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the release of the first HCoV-229E B814 species from fluids from the nose of patients who suffered severe fever, various CoV viruses have been released from various infected animals, including ducks, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoV viruses have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV's discovery in the temporary order (the 1) table can be educational and directing.
The first type of HCoV-229E was released through the breathing process of patients with the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and later continued to grow in the stages of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected HCoV-229E showed symptoms of common fever, including headaches, sneezing, fatigue and stinging throat, with high heat and cough appearing in 10 cases~20%.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 virus was released from joint cultivation and enrollment in the brains of nursing rats.
HCoV-OC43 medical components appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished from those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229Evirus and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world, and appears to be more widespread during the winter season in moderate weather.
In general, the time between infection and the emergence of this virus is less than a week and, followed by a disease of about 2 weeks.
According to human volunteer research, health workers infected HCoV-229E had a common fever.
Only a few patients whose body defenses are weak showed severe low respiratory attacks.
SARS virus, also known as "uncommon pneumonia", was the first disaster caused by HCoV in human history well copied by the biological agent is SARS-CoV virus, the third HCoV virus discovered.
SARS's first case can be traced until late 2002 in Gungdong Province in China.
SARS caused 8,096 cases reported by 774 deaths, and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the main extensions, it was estimated that each case would trigger about two second cases and the period between infection and the emergence of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus level appearing on 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV originally show symptoms of pain in the muscles, headaches, high temperatures, fatigue and coldness, then respiratory problems, coughs and respiratory problems as future symptoms.
The decline of limfotic cells in blood, a study of damaged liver function, and an increase in kriatini is an unusual study of SARS's romantic.
The destruction of alveola, the rise in epithelia cells and the increase in the makofies are also seen by SARS patients.
About 20–30% of patients later require deep treatment and respiratory aid machines.
Despite the lower respiratory method, many organs including the gut gas method, liver and kidney can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a sytokin explosion, which can be especially dangerous for patients whose body defenses have been affected.
This virus was first released from a study of the patient's lung surgery who traveled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.
Since then, sincere efforts have been placed in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 virus was released from a child of age -7 months in the Netherlands in late 2004.
At first they were discovered to spread among small children, elderly people and patients whose body immunity has been affected with respiratory diseases.
The appearance of the flu, the inflamesion of the eye's kjakeva, high temperature and bronocolitisi are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another free research described the release of the same virus from nose samples from a -8-month-old boy who was suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although recognized in the Netherlands, they spread around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 contributes 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and occurs extensively during the early summer, leaks and winters.
HCoV-NL63 virus is associated with the burning of throat blocking the throat, also called the rhino.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 virus was released from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and blocked air routes in Hong Kong.
Apart from the social-speed pneumonia and blocking air channels in the lungs, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with a severe increase in asthma.
Virus similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found worldwide and caused moderate asthma diseases.
All of these social-speed HCoV viruses have found a way to stay in humans well and have little chance of changing to end viral disease, although accidents occurred for unknown reasons as in rare cases of the smaller types of HCoV-NL63 virus, which were recently reported to cause severe low-speed respiratory transmissions in China.
In general, when these HCoV virus has gained the ability to spread effectively and continue to maintain themselves within humans, also their ability to virus or pathogenetic is decreasing.
MERS-CoV virus was first released in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung patient who suffered severe pneumonia and fucking through urine transmission in Saudi Arabia.
Although many cases confirmed in romance occurred in the Middle East, cases from foreign countries that spread from other people to people who had been closely connected with them have been reported in Europe and Tunisia.
Another second blast occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS medical signs are similar to SARS, with a reputation for the ongoing severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffered a ureth, which is very unique to MERS among HCoV diseases.
Over 30% of patients show symptoms of stomach problems, such as operating and scoring.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases confirmed in romance were reported with high mortality rates for 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the worst known viruses by humans.
In the mid-final period until late December 2019, a collection of pneumonia patients originally known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 was discovered at Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization announced the ongoing frequency of low respiratory transmission caused by SARS-CoV-2 as the Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease as COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide by a terrifying rate of 3.4% deaths.
It is evident that, the death rate of deaths in Hubei County, China is 4.2%, while outside the county is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is evident as high body heat, cough and difficulty in breathing.
Driving is also evident to some patients.
Nimonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can continue to grow rapidly and become a sharp sindrom of respiratory problems.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virus closely resembles a similar high series of 82% nukleotidi, it merges into different branches in the filogenetic painting.
It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 has little potential to cause illness but its distribution is high compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People who do not show signs of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 and six other types of HCoV have raised similarities and very interesting differences.
First, the period between infection and emergence and the period of HCoV disease is equal.
Due to this, SARS-CoV-2 virus follows the normal condition of other HCoV viruses.
Second, the weight of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four HCoV virus distributed social (i. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2's transmission shows qualities that are usually seen during the outbreak of HCoV's social virus, including showing specific symptoms, moderate or even absence of any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the SARS-CoV episode, although the measurements are lower.
Third, SARS-COV-2 distribution also shows the impressive HCoV pattern distributed in the community by SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the ability to be distributed to SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the HCoV virus distributed socially.
On the other hand, it will remain confirmed if the ability to spread SARS-COV-2 is reduced after human transmission as in SARS-CoV cases and MERS-CoV.
Finally, similar to other HCoV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected on a sample of feces.
If SARS-CoV-2 distribution through feces on lips plays an important role as in SARS-CoV at least under certain circumstances remains open through future research.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 virus can occur in seasons as in HCoV cases distributed socially.
Despite this, SARS-CoV-2 components including the ability to be distributed, the ability to infect and continue to spread after human transmission will have influence on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19.
All four HCoVs virus that causes moderate symptoms have become accustomed to humans.
In another view, it may also be the fact that humans are accustomed to these four HCoV viruses.
In other words, all may be the remainder of the former HCoV disaster.
HCoV virus that causes severe human and human diseases who suffered severe HCoV diseases have been removed.
It is this done, HCoV virus must be passed into humans to a reasonable degree of allowing a collection of changes that can fight the control patterns of the virus carrier.
With this logic, as SARS-CoV-2 is developing and how more people are infected, there is a strong possibility that it will be common to humans.
If this virus is well-seasoned, its spread to humans can be difficult to control through katanti or other measures to control the infection.
Over the years, four social-specific CoV viruses have spread among the people, triggering common fever among people/humans with strong immunity.
This virus does not require storage within an animal.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV virus that is more widely distributed to humans and its spread among humans cannot be controlled.
They need to maintain and promote their reserves within animals and seek a chance to spread to endangered humans, perhaps through a second and spreading carrier.
SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same characteristics as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs distributed social.
They are more likely to be distributed such as the HCoV virus distributed socially, at least at present.
However, it causes more disease than the HCoV virus distributed socially and its ability to cause illness is lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will remain visible if they are perfectly exposed to humans and spread into humans without a reserve or a carrier.
Before discussing the origins of HCoV animals, it would be good for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the growth, natural, conservation and carrier of HCoV's spread.
The animal serves as a CoV carrier if it has preserved a close clan similar in the level of the nukliotidi series.
Cycling virus is usually common and are unable to cause illness within this carrier.
Also, a reserve carrier has HCoV every time and long.
In all cases, viral carriers are naturally infected and are the native carriers of HCoV or its generation virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV virus has first entered the middle carrier before or about its human entry, it is not well-seasoned in the new environment and often causes illness.
This middle carrier can serve as a source from human-based animals and carries out the role of the carrier by allowing the virus to be produced and then distributed to humans to increase the rate of human transmission.
HCoV virus can pass through non-functional transmission if they cannot maintain its distribution within the middle carrier.
On the other hand, HCoV virus can also be absorbed into its middle carrier and even create a long-term condition.
In this case, the middle carrier becomes a natural carrier who preserves the virus.
The physiological Data that revealed through the rear that SARS's faharasa had a history of wandering with wild animals.
The following study of the level of infection indicated that animal traders had a high level of anti-SARS-CoV igG compared to the total population.
The baroa-face (Paguma larvata) and a raguni dog in living animals markets were first recognized to carry a virus similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was directly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases reported after the assassination of all the ngawas in the market.
However, it has been reported that the conga with a face-faced surface from the wild or rural areas without any contact with the animals sold in the market most of them were not found by SARS-CoV, and indicate that the face of blessing can only serve as middle carriers to spread but not the original SARS-CoV reserve.
It will be revealed that, since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodis fighting SARS-CoV, the possibility that many species of small mammals can also serve as the SARS-CoV middle carriers cannot be ignored.
All of these seem to be free carriers of SARS-CoV.
The following search for the SARS-CoV native carrier showed that the CoV virus related to bats, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found within Chinese horsehoe bats.
These bats have antibodi against SARS-CoV and SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 tooth pick.
This virus and other CoV bats have 88–92% similar nukleotidi with SARS-CoV.
This study has laid the basis for new concepts that bats carry emerging human viruses.
Several Covvirus (SL-CoVs) similar to SARS has also been identified on bats, but none of them except WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
Human hormone that causes blood pressure that changes enzaim 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receiver.
WIV1 virus released from a sample of bat feces was shown to use bats, ngawa and ACE2 human as a cell receiver.
Ironically, the policy from SARS's recovery patients was able to destroy WIV1.
So far, WIV1 virus represents the closest generation of SARS-CoV on bats, with 95% of the same nukleotidi pick.
In a large similarity between these viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the central SARS-CoV virus and bats are not middle carriers who preserve SARS-CoV.
Scientological analysis puts together MERS-CoV on a group similar to the CoV-HKU4 virus of bats and CoV-HKU5 bat virus.
CoV-HKU4 bat virus and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receivers, dioptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-references of the MERS-CoV RNAs are almost identical to the filogenetic and within the beta-CoV virus of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-COV virus can be found inside wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest species of CoV-HKU25 bat virus have only 87% of nukleotidi.
Thus, bats may not be middle carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, research conducted in the Middle East has shown that the tallest camels have a specific antibodi to balance MERS-CoV, similar to the Middle East camels in many African countries.
Living MERS-CoV virus that resembles viruses found in humans were released from nose samples from longer camels, and further indicate that camels can serve as true MERS-CoV virus carriers.
It is also important to remember that the moderate but most viral symptoms were generally seen by infected camels MERS-CoV for experiments.
Clearly, infected camels release viruses not only through breathing but also through feces, which is also the main means of releasing viruses from bats.
However, questions have not yet been answered as many cases of certified MERS have no history of wandering with camels before the start of symptoms, and indicate the great human impact to humans or unknown distribution methods involving species that are not recognized carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 virus contains 96.2% of nukleotidi similar to the CoV RaTG13 bat virus released from Rhinolophus affis.
As in SARS-CoV cases and MERS-CoV, the differences of the pick between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are larger so they cannot be fitted with a market relationship.
That is to say, bats may not be the closest carriers of SARS-CoV-2 except if the CoV virus of bats almost identical will be found in the future.
It may be considered that the SARS-CoV-2 central animal should be among the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Total Market, where many of the first COVID-19 cases were involved, suggesting the possibility of a distribution event from an animal to humans.
Many recent studies that focus on the melonomics have indicated that a group of endangered small mammals known as an older brother (Manis javanica) can carry traditional beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2.
These CoVs from the brothers see you have 85–92% of the nukleotidi's homophysics similar to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, they are also equally related to RaTG13 for about 90% of identity at the level of the nukleotidi series.
It is arranged in two small types of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a filogenetic painting, one of them sharing the same counter-reference (RDB) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of the amino acid series.
In a clear comparison, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD virus and RaTG13 are quite different, although the large amount of the width of the tooth-like tooth.
Previous research on the sick brothers also reported the discovery of viruses in kidney samples that, resulting in contact with SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different collection and repair techniques to produce half a tooth pick with 86.3% of the full length of the virus tooth.
We can't block out the possibility that the brother sees you is one of SARS-CoV-2's central animals.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2's brother's sight due to the differences between SARS-CoV-2 virus and beta-CoVs virus related to SARS-CoV-2 of the brother.
Also, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the one between beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 available to the brother see you.
SARS-CoV-2 growth method in bats, saw and other mammals still remain recognized.
Although the highest similarity of the pick has been found on RBD between beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 available to the brothers, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have a high ratio of tooth pick.
It is highly estimated that the high level of similarity between the RBD of beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2 found within the brother and SARS-CoV-2 is promoted by the growth of the gathering brought on the basis of selection.
The counter-in-defense proposal supports reunification between beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2 available to the brother and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As an impulse in growth, re-consolidation has spread among beta-CoV virus.
The decision has not yet been reached about SARS-CoV-2's immediate origin from animals.
Apart from HCoV's main possibility to cause disease, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 from animals has also been researched.
Archaeological evidence shows that HCoV-NL63 virus and HCoV-229E may have been derived from bat-CoV, with the generations of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 virus found within the mouse community.
The bat CoV virus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) discovered in North America three-colored bats showed close ties to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E virus was related to the other bat CoV virus, called Hipposideros/Ghana Kwam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, with small camel animals also suspected of being its middle carriers.
Clearly, current knowledge of the nature of HCoV virus animals known is briefly placed in a 1st painting by the 2nd Jeddi.
Historical analysis has provided evidence of HCoV distribution events between animal species in history.
While HCoV-OC43 virus spread between animals and human transmission from animals around1890, the asthma pandemic was witnessed.
The history of distribution between HCoV-229E animals is unclear.
alpha-CoV bat virus related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among the virus is alpha-CoV virus available to alpaca, an animal species.
Several lines of evidence support direct transmission from bats to humans.
First, humans are not alpaca who are animals may have had contact with bats in the biological environment.
Instead, humans are in close contact with the animal alpaca.
Second, alpha-CoVs bat virus related to HCoV-229E is different and unable to cause disease within bats, while alpha-CoV virus found in alpaca caused a respiratory disease for infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV virus found in alpaca has not been found within wild animals.
Thus, alpaca's chances of getting alpha-CoV virus related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be locked out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human disease virus including rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendravirus.
So it is not very strange that bats have the ability to distribute HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Other than that, although alpha-CoV virus is used as a HCoV-229E gene team, alpaca and longer camels may serve as middle carriers of viruses that distribute viruses to humans, especially in the MERS-CoV condition.
MERS-CoV virus serves as an excellent example of distribution between animals from bats to long camels and from tall camels to humans.
The nature of the MERS-CoV growth from bats is known in its first recognition and has also been confirmed by the following results.
It is clear that bats provide a large collection of viruses for interchanges between animals of kinic components and distribution between animals.
The ability to live for a long time, a home with many animals, close social interaction and the stable ability to fly are conditions that make bats 'a animal capable of spreading viruses'.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been in a long camel for decades.
They were well-seasoned in these camels who have evolved from middle-class carriers to become stable and natural carriers who preserve the virus.
MERS-CoV causes severe illness and maintains a low rate of change compared among these animals.
His immediate human distribution is fate and humans remain the last MERS-CoV carriers because its distribution cannot last.
On the contrary, the role of camels in the MERS-CoV distribution, the role of the brother see you, if there is anything, in SARS-CoV-2 distribution is different.
Hususan, beta-CoV virus available to an older brother has a great capacity to cause disease within the older brother.
They may be the beta-CoV virus carriers related to SARS-CoV-2-uncomparable, similar to the ngawa in SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 distribution between creatures from animals to humans must be accepted or rejected in future sku research.
First, bats may be carriers of viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the ecological and bat environment through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the brother saw you may be one of the middle carriers who have contracted viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 for the first time.
Man finds viruses through slaughtering and eating wild animals.
There is a possibility that many mammals including domestic animals can find SARS-CoV-2.
Home and wild animal studies for antibodi are worth it.
Third, as mentioned above, the re-consolidation of SARS-CoV-2 may have been held in the third creature that was attached to bats and saw you.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 seals from animals is still underway.
Apart from different species of carriers, three main patterns on the side of the virus are also important in enabling CoVs virus to be spread to creatures.
First of all, their high rates of adaptation in RNA production.
Comparing to other RNA virus one, the estimated standards of CoV change may be considered to be "high" or "high" with the average exchange rate being ~10–4 per year per 2, based on a phase of the CoV on its new carrier.
CoVs virus has eksoribonuklis of urrusu, whose dismissal causes increased ability to change, reduce the effect or even its ability.
Interestingly, nucleotide alogue Remdesivir is known to eliminate CoV production through eksoribonuklis and RNA polymerisi based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most powerful vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 tested for medical tests.
Despite this, CoV's change rates are about a million times more than its carriers.
Also, changing rates are often high when CoV virus is not reflected in the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV virus with high rates of adaptation, SARS-CoV-2 change rates are evident that they are below, a condition that signals the highest potential for human transmission.
It can be taken that, they have already been exposed to another human-based carrier.
Along with SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, a virus that has been well-seasoned within the tallest camels.
In theory, there is no possibility that electronic changes can make vaccines and anti-virus anti- SARS-CoV-2 not to be quickly appropriate.
Second, the large RNA tooth on CoVs has more ability to change shape in tooth repair for change and re-consolidation, thus increasing the potential for growth together between creatures, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoV while suitable.
These are supported by a special open frame and the function of proteins sung towards the end of 3 of the tooth.
Third, CoV without order and occasionally changes the model during RNA production through a special process of "copy-choice".
Inside a virus carrier serving as a mixer, stradi exchange is held regularly during the copy of CoV RNA.
The most similar RNAs of full length and small tooth can be reunited to produce a new COV.
The eccletic evidence of the re-existing of natural integration has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as theCoV virus found within animals such as the SL-CoV virus of bats and CoV-HKU9 bat virus.
A virus carrier's interaction associated with distribution
Apart from the three models of the virus mentioned above, the interaction of the carrier's receptors is another important example of influence on the distribution between creatures.
Here, the reunification of SARS-CoV is considered a common model, which also showed evidence of positive selection during the distribution events between creatures.
According to comparative analysis between SARS-CoV within humans and ngawa, SARS-CoV is thought to be quickly absorbed within different carriers, especially for changes in the RBD of S protein.
In total, RBD on the CoV protein interacts with the cell receiver and is carefully selected by the driver's antibodi answer.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the amino acid of 318 and 510 in the S1 piece, which you don't dream ACE2 human with major receptors for the entry of the virus.
SARS-CoV's RBD has the ability to identify the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, ngawa, rats and dogs, allowing the distribution of viruses between creatures.
In fact, only 6 remains of amino acids were found to be different from humanized viruses and ngawa on RBD and 4 of them are in the connecting of receivers for interaction with ACE2 receivers.
SARS-CoV virus within Ngawa has a change of K479N and S487T on their RBD, which can increase the possibility of the S protein and human receivers of ACE2.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be important in the human virus.
It is important to remember that SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same cell receptors and SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the ability of S protein to be connected with the human ACE2 may have changed.
Of course, croyo-EM research shows the possibility of a 10-to 20-more of this plant than between the human protein of ACE2 and SARS-CoV S.
It will be interesting to determine if any volenzas can be required for SARS-CoV-2 distribution.
Ironically, HCoV-NL63 also doesn't dream on ACE2 but for a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminoptisi N of HCoV-229E, and anti-specific acid of 9-O-acetylated HCoV-OC43.
They can also lead to the effectiveness of these CoV virus to humans after the distribution between creatures from their carriers.
Along with cell receivers, the results of HCoV distribution between creatures are also dominated by support and other carriers and prevention patterns.
The difference of these animal proteins between humans and natural carriers of HCoV virus such as bats, longer camels and weed animals may be a setback to distribution between creatures.
HCoV virus must be avirus of the virus carrier's support and replace the anti-virus prevention devices to succeed in spreading viruses between creatures.
For this album, the melodics in this vital part of the interaction between the virus and its carrier have not yet been identified and classified.
A thorough survey of the tooth carrier with a teemetery and SARS-CoV-2 prevention patterns using its CRISPR technology may produce fruit.
The emergence of the new HCoV virus: going back completely
Various types of bat CoV offer many opportunities for the emergence of the new HCoV.
With this logic, the CoV virus of bats serves as a collection of various HCoV genes.
Despite this, rapid change and integration also enable HCoV growth and becomes two key steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing a new protein-song gene is likely to quickly change the virus sample.
Among SARS-CoV's access proteins, ORF8 has been considered essential to humanization, as SARS-CoV virus related to bats was released but were found to sing different ORF8 proteins.
The reputation of the 29 SARS-CoV nukleotidi is found in samples dedicated at the beginning of the human disaster.
This re-election divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a change in the process that allows for the replacement of virus carriers.
Also, SARS-CoV has the possibility of having a history of merger with alpha-and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small areas of connecting units were identified on RNA polymerisi based on RNA.
The connecting areas were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV disaster saw events of integration between different generations, which occurred in the tallest camels in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-unification events that other HCoV species have also been witnessed, where the various HCoVs are re-connected with other CoV virus of animals on their non-shaped genes.
A caution should also be remembered that artificial selection can contribute to undiscorporated changes in viral tooth, often due to the removal of the selection virus, such as the immune system of a virus carrier.
An example of these effects is the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the original HCoV-229E sample, due to the removal of two nukleotidi.
With ORF4 stable with the possibility of being found in a virus found on bats and camels related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV virus found in alpaca showed the installation of one nukleotidi, causing the change of frame.
Eventually, the growth of the new HCoV virus also comes from the pressure of selection at the carrier's reserve.
The absence of symptoms or moderate symptoms was discovered when bats were infected with CoV, suggesting a joint contact between CoV and bats.
It seemed that the CoV virus was transmitted to good bats and body function.
For example, the fault in coping with burns inside bats was able to reduce the risk of causing disease is made possible by CoV.
Also, the operation of the natural killer cell on bats has been developed due to the production of receptors of the NKG2/CD94 natural cell and low levels of I's of tissue combination.
Moreover, a large amount of active oxygen (ROS) produced from multiple activities in the body of bats can cause the CoV and affect the Eksoribonuklis review, thus providing a selection pressure for the production of a virus with the main potential for causing disease when it is introduced into new environments.
More samples to cause CoV can grow through re-consolidation, resulting in the availability of new proteins or protein qualities for the transmission of the carrier.
Thus, it is not lucky that three new HCoVs virus has emerged in the last two decades.
CoV virus is not capable of causing disease or causes moderate symptoms for their carriers such as bats and camels.
It is produced in large numbers without showing the strong immune confrontation of its carrier.
Here is a secret about why non-remarked virus carriers are found and which causes severe cases in human infection.
Strong symptoms often result from high pressure from the body’s immune system to fight excessively by a sytokin explosion where the body’s immune system is very stable, the lungs become more damaged.
On the other hand, in non-remarked carriers, the body's immune confrontation is separated from CoV production.
The same strategy to separate the body's immune confrontations can be beneficial in medicine against SARS-CoV-2.
The effect of proteins provided by a virus carrier is particularly stable on bats.
Thus, the protein release provided by I virus carrier at least in the early SARS-CoV-2 phase in humans should be useful.
Moreover, NLRP3 inflammasome on bats is harmful.
With this logic, NLRP3 prevention inflammasome using MCC950 may be important in COVID-19 treatment.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 follows a general style where SARS-CoV virus and MERS-CoV emerged.
Although beta-CoV bat virus with 95% of nukleotidi and SARS-CoV have been found, there are also the CoV virus of bats that have had a 96% of nukleotidi and SARS-CoV-2.
Although ngawa and other animals in the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the nearby SARS-CoV-2 carriers have not been identified.
Beta-CoVs virus available to the brothers that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, this suggests that the brother sees them may be middle carriers or beta-CoV virus available to the brother see you can contribute gene fragments to the last type of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 virus is deliberately made by humans.
CoV virus has returned to re-existing due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 rebound.
CoV virus research within bats and other animals has quickly changed our attitudes about the importance of animal slaughter and the preservation of HCoV animals in human distribution.
The widespread evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have roots from bats and are distributed to humans through middle carriers.
Since SARS-CoV's release comes from human confusion and ngawa in the market, closing animal markets and killing all the ngawa there would help to end SARS disaster.
With similar logic, the brother saw you should be removed from the animal market to prevent animal distribution, due to the discovery of many generations of beta-CoV available to the brothers closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, with the way SARS-CoV-2 virus is distributed to humans through the brothers and other mammals remains open in future investigation.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been in the longest camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool in transporting with the main source of meat, milk, leather products and cotton products for people in the street.
They have spread across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to kill all camels to control MERS, as done in Chinese wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the regular MERS' frequent leaks, the direction todoti should be taken to create a suitable vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, as well as other strategies to control the transmission.
Because we cannot remove this virus, new types can emerge and cause leaks.
Many types of CoV virus distributed by animals are distributed in the wild.
Hususan, CoV virus caused by bats with the ability to be distributed by animals is too much.
There are many opportunities where these CoV virus distributed by animals grows and merges again, resulting in the emergence of other CoV virus that is most distributed by/or is the most dangerous for humans in the future.
The culture of wild eating animals in some areas in China should be abandoned to reduce the interaction between humans and animals.
Because of SARS's problems, MERS and COVID-19, the situation of good preparation and the plan to deal should be set.
Indeed, many viruses have existed on earth for a long time.
This virus lives in their natural reserves until there is a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that enable the spread of viruses, the human position to interact with bats and other wild creatures can be reduced if people are educated to stay away from the animals.
It is important to study the continuation of animals to better understand the CoVology and their natural carriers, which will show that it is important in preventing distribution from animal to human beings and future leaks.
To conclude, the best way to prevent the distribution of viruses from animals is for humans to stay away from the biological environment of natural conservationists distributed from animals.
There are still many unknown features about SARS-CoV-2's origin from animals.
First, if bats are distributing SARS-CoV-2 virus to an older brother, it would be interesting to see in what circumstances bats and brothers can be found in the same ecological environment.
Second, if bats have a more direct position in human distribution, it should be noted how humans interact with bats.
Third, if the third mammals serve as a real middle carrier, it should be defined how the animal interacts with other creatures including humans, bats and brothers.
Finally, since other animals including domestic animals may be at risk of getting SARS-CoV-2, the study and testing process should be conducted.
If it is bats, a brother or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its virus is almost identical to its natural carriers in the future.
The continued investigation in this field will determine the way of SARS-CoV-2 growth in animals, and a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Retrieved the testing process of "a suspected" and "confirmed" COVID-19 is essential
On 6 February 2020, our team published a guide to rapid research and treatment of new korona 2019 virus (2019-nCoV), and guidance provided our experience and set good references for fighting this major global disaster.
However, the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge continue to develop according to the results of the ongoing degree and experience of medical actions; thus, the testing and treatment cuts are also being decided.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our guidance and provided a new process of testing of "a suspected" test and "confirmed" according to the recent guidelines of COVID-19 Survey and Treatment (seven edition) by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 new korona virus (2019-nCoV) has caused a re-existing, now officially known as korona 2019 virus (COVID-19) and its virus is named as a sevete respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a major disaster.
To fight SARS-CoV-2, our team has created a quick advice guide and has been published online on Army Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted great attention since its publication.
Remember, however, that COVID-19 is a new illness, our awareness and knowledge are increasing according to the results of ongoing research and medical services experience, so the research and treatment strategies are also underway.
For example, COVID-19 Surveying and Treatment Guides issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 until 3 March 2020, it has released a total of seven editions with some of the contexts being adapted to content.
Now our guidance received comments from Zhou and his colleagues., they brought a simple proposal to get a instrument according to their medical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guidance and also made a valuable reference to this tragedy around the world.
We recommend their vital work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be adapted according to the recent Guide of COVID-19 Survey and Treatment (the seventh test) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirming suspected cases requires including any single of the elements of ecological history and two certifications to conduct an examination of the todots or needs to satisfy three medical manifestations if there is no clear history of the physiology:
Archaeological history: (1) travel history or living in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days before the start of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases (in positive levels of nyklea acid); (3) a history of contact with patients with high temperatures or asthma from Wuhan and other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the past 14 days before starting with symptoms; (4) the history of touching cases with more heat symptoms or asthma from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the past 14 days before starting with symptoms; (4) the history of contact with a collection of confirmed cases (2 or more hot symptoms/or symptoms of the body/or symptoms within the week, such as the school.
Medical manifestation: (1) high body temperature and/or asthma symptoms; (2) the visible qualities of COVID-19; (3) the total number of white blood cells that show the normal number, reduced white blood cells in the early phase.
The testing of the confirmed case should be based on the case with a suspected case of any of the evidence of the gnosology or biology follows: (1) the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus for a real time through PCR measurements; (2) the entire genome of the virus that shows a large similarity to the new korona virus known; (3) there is a specific antibodi of IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in the measure of the policy; or the change of the specific IgG of SARS-CoV-2 to be absent or increased 4 times more in the process of recovery.
We can see that PCR's actual measure for nuclear acid on the respiratory path or blood sample was added to the second edition (Tarehe 18 January 2020) and third (Tarehe 22 January 2020).
The discovery of a blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); and the biological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These amendments according to researchers continued the job of finding a better package to detect nyklea acid for quick testing, as well as samples from asthma including blood sample, which increased the packaging of different samples and helped bring with positive results of specific antibodis in a proven process.
Besides, there is much more resistance that reminds us of caution from patients with unusual symptoms and those who have no symptoms.
Thus, the Zhou chart and his colleagues should be decided, because it classified a person without medical symptoms as "low risk".
The mark system also needs to be confirmed in later medical actions and research.
Complete, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and we give readers their opinion.
With a test of "a suspected" and "confirmed" test, we suggest being followed by the allegiance of new guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also move for the right time our guidance to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest reported daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 for that day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day from viruses.
By yesterday, Bangladesh's Epidiology Institute, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded cases of infection that included 114 cases existing with 33 cases of people living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were of people over 60, two between 51 and 60 years of age and one 41–50.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a major disaster on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu, a domestic news agency that one of those who lost their lives was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director at the Bengani Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video broadcast online, Bangladesh's Minister of Transportation Obaidul Quader said public transportation would be closed for more time than originally planned, until this next Saturday.
The closure of this public transport had begun earlier on 26 March and was planned to end on Saturday, 4th.
Transport of important products -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first COVID-19 events in Bangladesh were on 8 March, for two people who returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 virus exceeds one million attacks worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of korona SARS-CoV-2 cases passed one million worldwide, data from Johns Hopkins University showed it.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the korona virus.
This summit was reached the same day when Malawi confirmed its first outbreak of korona and Zambia cases confirmed the first death related to the korona virus.
North Korea announced, by Thursday, that it was one of the few countries that had no korona virus infection.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours before 10 a.m., Central European Hours (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, over 244 thousand cases of korona virus were recorded, combining 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were over 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by koronavirus infection.
Around the world, various countries announced more serious measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, was continued to be closed for city operations until 1 May.
National, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian citizens would continue to be paid without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to increase the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed by 215 votes of support, ten of the MPs who chose not to participate in a vote and one of the opposing votes.
Saudi Arabia added the kafyu day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to continue for the whole day; originally, the kafyu time was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to carry out a kafyu between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state increased the time of the order to stay at home until 1 May.
Stores in Australia reduced the number of sheet paper that one could buy
On Sunday evening and Saturday, Australian supermarkets of Woolworths and Coles reduced their sales of paper-selling to two and one monk for each single in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also launched a single package limit, on Monday.
These sets were published as messages in pay areas and on shopping Facebook pages.
Consumers were reported to buy goods in abundance due to COVID-19 fears if people need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolsworth also placed the bars for the purchase of a sheet from home delivery to one package for each order.
These changes followed the original four packages per single set by Woolsworths and Coles on 4 March and 5 March monk.
Coles, in his press release on 8 March, reported that even after placing four paper packages, "other cuts were still selling all paper products within an hour of transmission", and citing the need as "unpredicted", with ALDI, on Facebook on Tuesday calling it "unpredicted".
Sales increased "in the top talk" last week, according to Wolsworths.
Costco Store at Canberra also placed the level allowed to be two packages last week.
In response to the shortage, Coles hung large packages from the bidha and added occasionally to deliver products, Woolworths ordered extra products, with ALDI made products for special Wednesday plans earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Rejareja Association in Australia, said that retailers try to add goods, but local council restrictions on the time of the delivery of goods by car disabled his rai.
He expects to rise at production costs, with suppliers trying to meet a few special needs and plans.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that the early release of goods, some stores cannot run a special Wednesday plan.
In News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, retailer from Queensland University of Technology, said their stores fill goods every night.
He noted that the sheet is a large product, causing a small number of goods and sold, leaves large portions of their shelves empty and increases the feeling of deficit.
Coles and Woolworths have a view that if there were enough products on the shelf, if products such as shashi paper and the chips could be bought and widely available, there is a possibility of reducing anxiety, said Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The paper-making company from the paper used in Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday ago that they sold all their products.
Kimberly-Clark, a company that produces Kleenex Toilet Tisue and Solaris Paper that produces Sorbent, insisted that they were working 24/7 hours to maintain distribution of products, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a residential area, reported that some property dealers donated a sheet to the first broker in the organ in Melbourne, while a few auctions were made due to consumers getting a vacation from the long Leba Day wikend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily magazine published in Darwin, included an eight-page cut-out section and used as a sheet.
Stores originally did not want to impose restrictions, to be surprised by reports from ABC Australia on 3 March where they said they have no plans to place purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a high-profile need, including the mainland, chips, dry foods, soap washing hands and flour.
Also, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, the British online store Ocado seemed to reduce the purchase of Andres paper to 12 paper packs.
The World Health Organization has announced a widespread COVID-19 disease
Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced the continued outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the korona SARS-CoV-2 virus — a major disaster.
Although the term "great man" indicates how widespread illness is, not how dangerous special cases are, the World Health Organization saw the importance of encouraging nations to be a step:
All countries can still change the stage of this major disaster.
If countries recognize, measure, treat, separate, track and inspire their people in response, said Tedros Adharmo Ghebreyesus, Director-Prince of the World Health Organization.
We are deeply concerned with the standards of frustration and severity and the terrifying standards of non-activity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this major disaster "is unprecedented."
He said, in a comment published by CNN February, "but with influenza, no respiratory virus was traced from spread to international spread."
Ghebreyesus commented similar, saying "We have never seen a major tragedy caused by the korona virus before."
He continued, "and we've never seen a big tragedy that can be controlled at the same time."
A new situation as a major disaster follows the decision of the World Health Organization in January to announce the outbreak of this disease as a public health emergency for international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergology and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak of illness, "the foundation, goes to worse."
By Thursday, the United States Broadcasting Corporation reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, which resulted in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 main virus of the korona virus is a major disaster that goes through the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19), caused by serious respiratory problems 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak of illness was identified in Wuhan, China, December 2019, was declared the Concern for International Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and identified as a major disaster on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 nations and asylums, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
Death rates have been estimated to be 4% China, while the international is different from 13.04% Algeria to .08% New Zealand.
Common symptoms include high temperatures, cough and respiratory failure.
Problems may include pneumonia and chronic lung disease.
While from infection to the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or special antivirus treatment.
The primary treatment is to treat symptoms of illness and helpful treatment. The proposed preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when you cough, maintaining distances with other people, and monitoring and isolation for suspected people are infected.
Organizations in the world have taken action by setting restrictions on travel, installation of karantin, walking periods, risk restrictions at work, and closure of buildings.
This major tragedy has caused great social and economic chaos, delay or frustration with spot, religious, political and cultural events, and the spread of a shortage of goods due to the purchase of fear.
Schools and universities are closed on the international or local basis involved in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world's student population.
The lies about viruses are spread online, and there have been incidents of discrimination from other countries and discrimination against Chinese, other people from Eastern and South-east Asia or have the appearance, and others from areas with multiple viral cases.
Following reduced transport and closure of large industries, there has been a shortage of air pollution and carbon production.
Health Organizations Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of pneumonia with no source known on 31 January 2019, and a study was launched at the beginning of January 2020.
The cases were related to Huanan's Total Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a source of distribution from animals to humans.
The virus that caused the outbreak of disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, new viruses discovered and related to bat korona virus, the connavirus of the brother, and SARS-CoV. The first person known and the symptom was identified with suffering on 1 December 2019, and the person had no visible relationship with anyone in the market.
In the previous events reported on December 2019, two thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning magazine said that there was a case followed until 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei province, it may be the first episode.Tarehe 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that, how new cases said to have been reduced to China but exceeded Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China was first over the number of new cases in China.
There may be a lack of information for major cases, especially among those with weak symptoms.
By 26 February, at least a few cases were reported in young people, those aged 19 and below at 2.4% of the world's cases. British General Science Advisor Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population will need to be infected before immunity will be available through vaccines.
Cases mean the number of people measured by COVID-19, and their measure is proved positive according to official consensus.
By 23 March, no country measured over 3% of the population, and many countries have had official policy not to measure those with only weak symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
Research published on 16 March found that China, by 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19's release had not been discovered and that these unwritten transmissions were the source of 79% of the cases copied.
A study of 30 March data estimated that the Italian number was much higher than reported cases.
The original review of the number of production (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not see, time from the appearance of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, the numbers of the regular day being 14.
By 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, by 5 February as much as 80% of deaths were for those over 60, and 75% had previously health conditions with heart and vascular and diabetes diseases. The official death rate due to the major COVID-19 crisis generally means dead people who were tested and positive to COVID according to official utilification.
The sure number of deaths from COVID-19 may be more, as it may not include people who die without testing - k.m. home, in nursing rooms, etc.
The only amount of data from Italy became the number of additional deaths in a major disaster increased the official death figure of COVID deaths for 4–5x.
A spokesman for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention admitted "We know that [the mention of deaths] is a low estimate", a statement confirmed by confirmed reports of poor counting in the United States. A low estimate often occurs in a major disaster, as a disease of 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death was Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China Continent occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first outside of Asia was France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside China Continent, more than several deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries had reported deaths, in every continent except Antarctica. Several measures serve to count deaths.
These numbers differ from the area and when it increases, they are affected by the standard of measurement, the quality of the health care system, the type of treatment, during the first appearance, and the population condition as age, gender, and general health. The death rate to the case shows the death number divided by the number of cases identified in some time.
According to Johns Hopkins University figure, the international ratio of death-hadi-kisa is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) by 10 April 2020.
The numbers differ according to the area.
In China, estimates of the death rate compared to the case were reduced from 17.3% (for people with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms from 1 February 2020). Other units include the death rate for each case (CFR), which shines on the percentage of people tested who die of illness, the death rate from infection (IFR), which shines on the percentage of infected people (c.) die from disease.
These statistics are not bound by a temporary pattern and follow a specific number of people from the event to the solution of the case.
The number of scholars have tried to count these numbers in a special population.
Oxford University Witness Center estimates that death rates due to the total disaster are between 0.1% and 0.9%.
High estimates of this percentage are comparable to results from the test of chance for COVID-19 Germany, and data studies to investigate the impact of CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that this major disaster can be controlled.
The peak and time of the outbreak of this disease is unknown and may differ from the area.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Unless they are tracked, the outbreak of infection continues and then begins to decline when the disease ends with infected people.
But it is difficult to estimate or have an estimate now about when it is".
China's chief government adviser Zhong Nanshan said that "it may end by June" if all countries can be encouraged to follow the advice of the World Health Organization for the process of ending the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski Institute of Health & Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to spread, there is a year or two possibilities".
According to Imperial College's study led by Neil Ferguson, maintaining distances and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (there is a possibility of 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think there is no possibility that this korona virus—because it is easily infected—it will be completely lost" and may be "a seasonal illness, if it happens every year".
The resistance to return will depend on vaccines and the rate of viral change.
COVID-19 symptoms may not be special and people infected may not show any symptoms.
Two common symptoms are high temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Unusual symptoms include fatigue, breathing cough (hozi), loss of sense of smell, failure to breathe well, muscle pain and joints, throat pain, headache, feeling cold, vomiting, coughing blood, driving, or skin color. The World Health Organization says that about one out of six people suffer severe and trouble breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention is re-remarked by emergency symptoms such as a failure to breathe properly, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden anxiety, difficulty walking, face or lips of blue; quick treatment is advised if these symptoms exist. The continued disease can cause severe pneumonia, chronic lung disease, joint infection, shock and death.
Some of the infected people may not show any symptoms, without any medical symptoms but their test results prove that they are infected, so researchers have advised that those who have contact with people who have been confirmed infected should be traced and examined to eliminate fear of infection.
The Chinese estimate a range of non-remarkable people from a few to 44%.
The normal period of the presence of symptoms (the period between infection and the appearance of symptoms) comes from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. For example of uncertainty, the estimate of part of the COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was previously 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Other details of how the disease is infected are still under scrutiny.
The disease is believed to be primarily infected during the time of being close to drops from coughing, sneezing, or talking; and the person about to 1 to 2 m (6 to 6 m).
Studies have found that uncovering cough can enable drops to 4.5 m (6 ft) to 8.2 feet (27 ft).
Some have suggested that this virus is also able to be spread by long-term small drops in the air, which can come from the time of conversation. The breathing process is also able to get out of breathing, as well as when speaking, but these viruses are generally not infected through air.
These are able to reach the lips or noses of people nearby or pulled to the lungs.
Other medical procedures such as tube and lung revival (CPR) are able to cause respiratory fluids to be absorbed in the air and thus spread through air.
It can also be spread when a person touches a virus, as well as skin, and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
There is some doubt that it can be spread by feces, the danger is believed to be inferior.
The Chinese government opposed the possibility of distribution from waste to SARS-CoV-2 mouth. These Russians are heavily infected three days after the appearance of symptoms, although the distribution is possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of illness.
People have been tested and found positive for illness until three days before the appearance of symptoms indicates that distribution is possible before many symptoms occur.
There are only a few reports of confirmed cases of people who do not show any symptoms while they have a virus, but cases of infected and non-remarked people have been identified by other countries while monitoring people who have been infected with patients.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) mentions that although it is not perfectly clear to the spread of this disease, one person generally infects two or three people. Russians have the ability to pray alive for various parts of the hour to day.
Haswa, these viruses were found to be able to be discovered up to three days on plastic and steel that does not enter 304 rust, for a day on the cardboard, and up to four hours with copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature levels. Animals are popular with other animals have been found by COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread this virus to humans, but the British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, as after touching the infected people may have touched.
The chronic lung disease of the korona 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first found from three people with pneumonia related to cases of chronic respiratory diseases Wuhan.
Symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the world's related korona virus. The human body's body, these viruses are eaten by home-use soap, breaking the surrounding flower.SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be an infection from animals to humans.
genetic analysis has shown that the korona virus merges with the korona Beta virus cell, in a small species of Sarbe virus (generation B) as well as two species from bats.
It is a form of 96% in the cell level for other korona virus samples in bats (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in some part of the cell order between these viruses from the brother and those from humans.
All cell comparisons have so far discovered 92% of the cell material found in the connavirus of the brother and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove the brother to be a central parasite creature.
The infection of this virus can be temporarily identified with the symptoms, but the evidence is ultimately following the process of returning to a chemical cell and a combination (rRT-PCR) of infected liquids or CT medical photography.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has proposed that CT is much better than PCR, though not specific, and its photo-based components to interfere with other pneumonia and disease processes.
By March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends that "CT is not suitable for filtering or as the first test method to identify COVID-19".
WHO has published many of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the first publication released on 17 January.
The test uses to return to the chemical cell and the series (rRT-PCR).
An experiment can be made with samples of breathing or blood.
The overall results are found within hours to a few days.
This experiment is generally implemented using cotton in the nose although taking samples in the mouth is also used. Several laboratories and companies are creating a blood-based test, recognizing the immune system.
By 6 April 2020, none of these were proved real to be approved by many.
The United States blood test is created by Cellex has been approved for emergency use and a specially authorized laboratory.
The characteristics of radiology and computer medical images (CT) of people who are infected include a part of the lungs with low pressure and the absence of a liquid collection between the chest wall and lungs.
The Italian Radiology Society collects international storage of the results of proven medical images of confirmed cases.
Due to the integration of other issues such as adenovirus, giving images without proof through PCR has a shortage of specific issues in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of CT to PCR's chest image and showed that although medical images are not special to be transmitted, they are quick and better, to show his consideration as a filter device in the disaster areas.
Online programs designed by artificial intelligence have been designed to discover the medical components of the virus and medical images and CT.
The prevention process includes maintaining personal hygiene in general, washing hands, blocking eyes, nose, or mouth and hands that are not washed, and coughing or sneezing in tissue and putting dirty tissue directly into the garbage container.
Those who may be infected have already been advised to wear medical land in public.
The measures to maintain distance are also proposed to prevent distribution. Most governments have imposed restrictions or advised against any non-profit journey towards and from countries and affected areas and the outbreak of disease.
However, these viruses have reached the point of spreading to society in several parts of the world.
This means that viruses are spreading within the community and some community members do not know where or how they were infected. Medical providers who have treated a person who may be infected are recommended to use common precautions, the precautions of contact with eye protection. Tracking people who touched each other is an important way of health authority to determine the source of further distribution and prevent further distribution.
The use of local data from runu and government phones for these uses has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations to make an announcement wanting to be placed on borders for such surveillance.
A different runu phone program has been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than twelve professional groups were creating a solution that protects privacy, such as using Bluetooth to send distances and other runu phones.
The users then receive messages if they have been close to anyone who has been measured and found by COVID-19. The lie spreads about how to prevent the infection; for example, cleaning noses and slashing and oral cleaning compounds are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are busy making one.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of illness.
CDC proposes people to wash their hands from time to time with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if your hands seem dirty; before eating; after scraping the deacons, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, these viruses are eaten by home-use soap, which blasts its protective foam.
CDC further recommends using a cell liquid containing a disease - killer liquid with at least 60% of alcohol in moderation when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people not to hold eyes, nose, or mouth and hands that are not washed.
The used parts are able to be cleaned and killed with a different chemical (in one minute of using chemicals for a non-specific steel), as well as 62–71% ethanoli, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrojeni peroxide, and 0.2–7.5%povidone-iodine.
Other sulhus, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, have not been very successful.
CDC suggests that if COVID's case is suspected or confirmed in a building such as offices or child - care schools, each place such as offices, bathrooms, living rooms, electronic devices such as flat computers, touchdowns, keyboards, rimoti, and ATM machine used by patients, should be cleaned by antimicrobial drugs.
Health agencies recommended that people cover their lips and noses with a folded elbow or tissue when they cough or sneeze, throwing any tissue at once.
Medical land is recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a baroa can control the amount and distance to travel by breathing drops distributed when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued time instructions and how to use the mainland.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus scientist at Leeds University, "The wearing of the baroa can reduce [of] people touch their face, which is a major source of exposure without better hand hygiene. "Barakoa has also been recommended for use by those who care for anyone who may have this illness.
WHO recommends wearing the mainland and healthy people only if they are at risk, such as those who care for someone with COVID-19, although they have also admitted that wearing the baroa can help people touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of the continent and the public.
The United States, CDC recommends wearing a non-medical but a cloth-made plant.Uchina has specifically recommended the use of medical land that can be cast by people with public health, especially as it approaches (1 km) or less) and other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical bar when using public transportation or staying in a place where there is a lot of people.
Health officials Thailand urge people to make landers using cloths at home and washing them daily.
The Republic of Czech and Slovakia banned going out publicly without wearing a bargo or covering your noses and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear the bargoa while going to public places to protect themselves from others.
The Austrian government ordered everyone entering the store must wear the mainland.
Israel has asked all residents to wear land in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million landlands every day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and city buss to the city to wear facelands on 1st.
Panama has made it necessary to wear every time you go out, while it also proposes home production for those who can't buy the bargoa.
Barakoa has been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Staying away from society (also known as non-competitive) includes acts of control that are intended to reduce the spread of disease by reducing contact between people.
The strategy includes; travel restrictions; school closure, workplaces, fields, movies, or stores.
People can follow the methods of staying away from society by staying at home, reducing the journey, not going to a crowded area, greeting each other without touching, and maintaining distances with others.
Many governments have now ordered or proposed not to interact with people in affected areas and outbreaks of disease.
The size of a collection proposed by US government agencies and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no COVID-19 in some area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned a public gathering of more than two people. Old and walw people with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure, and a affected body immune system have a high risk of serious illness and problems and have been advised by CDC to stay at home as often as possible in the part of the outbreak of disease in society. Toward the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to change the word "not to be confused with people" and "to maintain distance with people", to describe that the goal is to reduce contact directly while maintaining a social relationship, or social distance.
The use of the word "based away from society" has led to the fact that people should be involved in a perfect social isolation, rather than urging them to continue contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have provided sexual health guidelines to use during a major disaster.
These include suggestions only to get along with someone you live with, with whom he has no virus or a sign of a virus.
The isolation-of-home has been proposed for those found by COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected.
Health agencies have provided detailed instructions for isolation-of-home in a proper way. Many governments have ordered or proposed the karantin of people living in affected areas.
The strict instructions on placing katanti are given to those in groups in high risk.
Those who may have had someone who had a COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or area with large distribution have been advised to put the katanti for 14 days from the time of the end may have been infected.
The controversy in the control of the outbreak of illness is to prevent increasing or suppressing, and avoiding each other.
Control is conducted in early phases of the re-existing and aims to track and isolate infected people together and bring other measures to control the transmission and vaccines to stop the spread of other people.
If it is no longer possible to control the spread of illness , effort is then moved into a process of avoiding each other: measures are taken to reduce the spread and avoid its impact on the health and social health system.
A combination of measures to prevent increasing and avoiding each other can be done together.
Oppression calls for a difficult step to change a major disaster by reducing the number of production bases to less than 1. The counter-confessive process is to try to reduce the peak of the explosion, known as balancing the disaster outbreak.
This reduces the risk of health care to be overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-specific issues that can control this leak include personal prevention measures such as washing hands, wearing face-faces and placing themselves in katanti; community measures aimed at staying socially as schools closed and interrupted by mass events to meet publicly; community ties to encourage acceptance and participation in similar strategies; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning areas. The most aggressive measures aimed at controlling the re-existing were taken in China only when the edge of the re-existing was open, such as putting the entire city in the karant and setting a solid ban on transport.
Other countries have also implemented various measures aimed at reducing the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduced public testing and regional katas, and warned of the transport of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected with those who put up karantin and fined a large fine for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased facial production and fined for the adoption of medical products.
Better prevention policies can reduce the demand for medical services during the explosion of 2/3 and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to be overwhelmed.

In Australia, this major disaster offered a new opportunity for exports from Australia in China.
The operation has caused a shortage of children's food in some supermarkets and was thus banned by the Australian government.Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and Wuhan, and continued to grow in demand for food products, the two parts have been sold in severe food shortages.
The measures of China and Italy against the adoption and illegal trade of important products have been successful, preventing the severe lack of food expected in Europe and North America as well.
Northern Italy and its large production of agricultural products have not suffered a significant shortage, but prices may rise according to industrial representatives.
Lack of food in the store was witnessed only for a while, even in Wuhan, with Chinese State officials offering pork reserves to assure people of sufficient food.
Such laws also exist in Italy that require food producers to save for such an emergency.
The destruction of the international economy has had a negative impact in China: according to a press report on 16 March, China's economy was heavily affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of viruses and retail sales declined by 20.5%.

The impact in the sector of the luxury ships was at an previously invisible level.
The train station and the ferry port are also closed.
This tragedy coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season associated with Chinese New Year's holiday.
Many events involving many people were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festival, and a private company also closing their only stores and tourist attraction such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and tourist attraction have been closed to block a mass collection, including Forbidden City Beijing and natural exhibitions at the temple.
In the 24th of China's 31 provinces, munispa and territories, authorities added New Year's vacation to 10 February, ordering parts of much work not to open until that day.
These areas represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of foreign sales.
Hong Kong increased the response to infectious diseases to the highest level and announced the emergency, and shut down school until March and cancelled New Year's festivals.Skta's retail business has been affected internationally, and the loss of working hours or temporarily closed.
Visits to European and Latin American dealers fell by 40%.
North and Middle American dealers saw a 50–60% decline.
This also caused a 33–43% shortage on foot trips to supermarkets in March compared to February.
The world's largest store operators set more steps, such as increasing sanitation, setting the heat-to-season devices to measure the temperature of consumers, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for a Latin American estimate, the recession following adversity may leave people from 14 to 22 million more in extreme Latin American poverty than it would be in that situation without adversity.
In January and February 2020, when the disaster was more severe Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs.

In the second phase of March, 4 million French workers applied for the benefit of non-employed and 1 million British employees sent applications for a loan plan for all.Takriban companies in Germany have sent their employees to a program funded by a short-term government known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work program has also been used by France and England.
The arts of activity and cultural turaths have been heavily influenced by this major disaster, having affected the operation of organizations and individuals—employed and employed—in nations.
Organizations in the art and cultural sectors tried to endorse their goal (usually funded by the public) to provide the ability to reach cultural turaths to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and to help possible artists.
By March 2020, around the world and in different levels, museums, libraries, theater, and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely by their performances, events and performances being deleted or suspended.

Fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially Europe, Central Asia, North America, and Asia Pacific.
Reports from February (where many cases were still only China) have seen the feelings of racism being directed to different Chinese groups in the world to qualify for a virus or receive what is claimed to be a proper penalty.
Other countries in Africa have seen feelings against the Chinese.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination according to the area from.
There have been support of Chinese, online and out hands, and for those in viral-related areas.

Many magazines with registration have removed them from some or with all information about the korona virus.
Many scientific publishers wrote scientific papers related to the re-existing and free access capacity.
Other scientists decided to spread their results quickly in the otomatics such as bioRxiv.

The test of asthma of the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19) and viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 including techniques that discover the existence of viruses and those that discover antibodis produced to fight the infection.
The presence of viruses on a virus sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which discovers the RNA protein of the korona virus.
This rating is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA protein alone.
It is used to confirm recent or ongoing attacks.
The discovery of antibodi (serology) can be used in investigation as well as surveillance.
Antibodi measurements show the number of people suffering from illness including those whose symptoms were too low to be reported or those who showed no symptoms.
The correct rate of deaths caused by this disease and the level of solid body immunity among people can be defined from this measurement.
Due to low testing rates, by March 2020 no countries had reliable data about the spread of viruses among its people.
By 23 March, no country had measured over 3% of its population, and there is a significant difference in the number of measurements made in various countries.
This diversity also has the potential to affect the high mortality rate, which is more likely to be estimated in some countries.
Using a real-time measure (rRT-PCR) the measure can be made on a sample of asthma found in various ways, including a sample of nose products or a sample of a cough.
The overall results are found within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR ratings made using throat samples are only expected in the first week of illness.
Later, viruses can be lost in the throat while they continue to breed in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternative sample devices can be taken from the depth of respiratory channels through a body fluid or cough (shozi) can be used.
One of the original PCR measurements was created in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a real-time measure (rRT-PCR), and became the basis for 250,000 packages distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also created a measure by 23 January 2020. South Korean Kogenebiotech , created a package to discover SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR of medical status (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It seeks a "E" type of "E" similar to all beta koronavirus, and RdRp's jingle which is especially found in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Administration of Medical Products in China for the SARS-CoV-2 package based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes its PCR Study System of the Real PCR of the Cron 2019 (2019) for the public health of the International Society of the World of the World of the World Society.
One of the three electronic measurements in the original versions of testing packages caused an unincorporated release from evil testing instruments, and the testing sequence at the CDC station in Atlanta; this caused an average number of 100 samples to be tested effectively throughout the entire February 2020.
The measurements using the ingredients were not defined as reliable until 28 February 2020, it was until this time that national and street romance was allowed to operate measurements.
The rating was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the adoption of Use in Emergency. Markani's commercial disaster began to perform measurements in March 2020.
By 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the presence of COVID-19 in a nation using RT-PCR.
Quest Dignostics also made COVID-19 measurements available by 9 March 2020.
No ratings were announced; collection and sample cutting must be made according to CDC needs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 measure was created and produced by the National Environmental Research Center and Bayoteknological VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the measure was registered by the Federal Treatment Service.Tarehe 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to create a test to discover COVID-19 .Tarehe 13 March 2020, Roche Dignotics received approval from FDA for a measure that would be made within 3.5 hours for the top, thus allowing one machine to do about 4,128 measurements for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency-use approval (EUA) to Abbott Laboratorys in a measure of the Abbott system of m2000; the FDA had previously issued the same approval for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the same EUA approval from FDA for a measure that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a measure using nuclear acid production technology based on a solid temperature measure rather than PCR.
Because this measure does not require a changing temperature pick, this technique can give positive results in a short five-minute minute and negative releases in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott expect to increase production to provide 50,000 measurements per day. A test using similar antibodis of nucleocapsid protein (protin N) of new korona virus is formed in Taiwan, with the belief that it will produce results after 15 to 20 minutes as only as a flu test.
The review of the March 2020 article concluded that "the chest units are of low value in the original phase, with CT's results [a photo of the body's organs shown by computers] being able to exist even before the appearance of symptoms."
Common features on CT include glass with two rock lines that block light with side-side, non-specific, non-specific and back-up.
The presence of Subpleural in abundance, the evil way and strengthening grow the disease if it continues to grow.
A study comparing PCR to CT at Wuhan during the emergence of the current major disaster has proposed that CT is much better than PCR, although not specific with its many graphic components to interfere with other pneumonia and disease processes.
By March 2020, the American Radioology College suggests that "CT should not be used to investigate or first phase of COVID-19". By March 2020, CDC recommends PCR to be used in the original investigation.
The body's immune part is an antibodi production including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect interference within people from 7 days after the start of symptoms, detect the immune system, and the monitoring of the people. The tests can be made in the middle romance (CLT) or by testing in the care areas (PoCT).
The automatic body testing systems in many clinic information will be able to implement these tests but their access will depend on the level of production of each system.
For CLT one sample of side blood is used, although the zugu sample can be used to monitor the body's immune confrontation.
For PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained from skin pressure.
Unlike PCR's methods of taking action is not necessary before the test.Tarehe 26 March 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that reported to the organization needed and therefore currently have the ability to distribute their antibodi measurements.
By 7 April 2020, one single attempt has been approved by FDA under emergency approval. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Disagnostics and Epitope Dignotics received European approval of their packages, which can detect IgG and IgA anti-virus on a blood sample.
The testing capacity is hundreds of samples within the clock and is thus faster than the usual PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibodi can usually be discovered 14 days after the start of the release.Mapema April, England found that no antibodi package bought to be best used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan where suspected victims may stay at home, "an emergency care will give the patient a sample bottle", he will spit in it, return and get a test results in time.NHS of England has announced that it is conducting tests to measure people suspected of being sick at home, which removes the risk of other patients coming to hospital or forced to kill germs on ambulances if used by the patient. In COVID-19 tests for suspected cases, a health expert takes samples with appropriate precautions.
Car-based stations have helped South Korea implement some of the fastest and most extensive measurements of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March, that it had a rate of approximately 12,000 per day in the ambulansi and 10,700 had been measured last week.
The cost is funded by health insurance when the measure is prescribed by the doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 per week.
By 19 March drive measurements were made in several major cities.
By 26 March 2020 the total number of measurements carried out in Germany was unknown, because the results of the only victims were reported.
The first laboratory study showed that by the week of 12/2020 calendars total of at least 483,295 samples were measured to and including 12/2020 weeks and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2.It is Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tried a sample test method from 64 patients at one time, by putting together samples and measuring more if a sample mix is available to be affected. There Wuhan lab of emergency discovery created of 2000 square metres called "Hian" (Ki) (Ki: ed.
And if construction was managed by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and completed in 5 days, estimates have shown the case Hubei would be 47% more and the accompanying cost of facing the katanti would double if this measurement rate was not established.
Wuhan Laboratory has been quickly followed by the Hu-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020 the total daily possibility was 50,000 measurements per day. Different options available free of charge by Origami Assays have been released and have the capacity to measure the amount of 1122 COVID19 patients using only 93 measurements . These balanced designs can be used in a small laboratory without needing the use of robots to handle water.
As of March, the decline and poor ratings of the testing of the EU and the United States have been a challenge for public testing EU and the United States.
This has caused publishers to study sample processing processes involving heat samples in 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for more measurements.Tarehe 31 March was announced that the Arab Empire's Union was now measuring more people with koronavirus than any other country, and was running to increase testing rates to reach the highest population.
This was through the inclusion of the ability to serve when people have a romantic purchase to measure a large number of people from Group 42 and BGI (according to their romance of the "Hoo-Yan" emergency discovery in China).
Built within 14 days, this romance has the capacity to make thousands of RT-PCR measurements daily and the first world with similar abilities used outside China.
Various testing units aimed at various parts of the korona virus process were formed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The Health Organization of the U.S. Health Organization began using German reprises to make packages sent to low-income nations with no ability to create their own.
The German response was published on 17 January 2020; a consensus produced by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, and delayed the ratings available in the United States.Uchina and the United States had problems and efficiency of the pre-existing units, and these countries and Australia could not provide adequate equipment according to the needs and recommendations for testing by health experts.
In comparison, experts say that access to testing in many areas of South Korea helped reduce the spread of new korona viruses.
The ability to measure, the largest in the romance of the private sector, was built over a long period by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for a jersey for testing plans as a means to reduce the spread of the major COVID-19 disaster. The top-level package of testing packages due to the spread of many viruses caused hundreds of thousands of measurements in personal romance in the United States, and there was a decrease in the distribution of chemical testing chemicals.
In March 2020 China reported problems in the accuracy of testing packages.
In the United States, the testing packages created by CDC had "freeness;" the government then removed restrictions that blocked personal testing .The Spanish country purchased testing packages from China's Shenzhen Bioessy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the measurement were incorrect.
The organization explained that these incorrect results can result from not collecting samples or not using packages properly.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove packages that returned incorrect results, and would use packages released by Shenzhen Bioeasy instead.80% of the testing packages that the Czech Republic purchased from China provided incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million packages from China that were found to not produce correct results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube.Ateş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the testing packages that Turkey purchased from China had "high level of wrongdoing" and "did not use them." The UK country bought 3.5 million packages from China but in early April 2020 announced they were not able to be used.
Surveying, being picked up by the katanti of those tested and diagnosed with disease and the monitoring of those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2, occurred in the effects of infection.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vō, the first death scene from COVID-19 in Italy, operated two measuring phases for a total population of 3,400, about ten days.
About half of the people diagnosed with illness had no symptoms and all the cases discovered were placed in katanti.
With transport controlled, this completely removed new growth.
With a strong track program, internal transport restrictions, testing and karantin, the 2020 korona virus crisis in Singapore has spread more slowly than other developed nations, but without restrictions on the worst conditions such as forcing restaurants and retail stores.
Many events have been interrupted by Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened for the right time after vacation on 23 March.
Many other countries have also controlled this major disaster with a strong track program, travel restrictions within the country, testing and karantin, but at a low rate of closing normal operations, such as Aisland and South Korea.
A digital study has shown that nations that have measured more, compared to the death toll, have low rates of cases, probably because of these nations being able to detect those with moderate or no symptoms.
WHO suggests that unable nations to measure and national romance with low experience about COVID-19 send the first five cases of the availability of disease and the first ten samples without COVID-19 in one of WHO's 16 romances for evidence testing.
Between romance involved 16, 7 is in Asia, 5 is in Europe, 2 Africa, 1 North America and 1 Australia.
On the following chart, the vertical column of "The disease as % of measurement" is inspired by the test policy.
The country that measures hospital admission only will have a higher number of cases of disease such as % of measurement than the country measuring all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other factors being equal.
Washing hands (or handwashing), where it is also known as handwashing, is an act of handwashing for the purpose of removing sand, dirt, germs or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap every time in "some important times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example driving and cholera, which is distributed through the feces to the mouth.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common fever, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. membreni with liquid).
Five important times during the day when washing the hand with soap is important include: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby’s toilet or changing the tube, before giving food to the baby, before eating and before and after providing food or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after serving the patient.
After changing the nepi or cleaning the baby who has gone to the toilet.
After scraping the deacons, coughing or sneezing.
After catching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
The purity of medical hands refers to cleaning activities related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary objective of handwashing is to clean hands from viruses (bakteria, viruses, or other germs that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important act for the public in general.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, koronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes by driving; reducing infectious diseases; reducing infectious diseases;
and reduced infant mortality during delivery at home.
Research conducted 2013 showed that improving handwashing actions can lead to low levels in children's height under the age of five.
In developing nations, child mortality rates related to respiratory and operating diseases can be prevented by introducing changes in simple behaviors, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
The issues that urge people to wash hands can reduce operating periods by about a third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low income areas.
48% of the decline in operating sessions can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is one of the most expensive ways to prevent operating and respiratory disease (AR), as a common conduct followed at home, school and in society around the world.
Nimonia, the main type of ARI, is the number one cause of the deaths of children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Driving and pneumonia collectively contribute to the deaths of about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet as habits can save more lives than any vaccine or medical strategy, reducing deaths from nearly half and deaths from asthma attacks for a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other cleaning strategies as part of water, cleaning plans and satisfaction (OSH).
Washing hands also prevents rash skin disease that is distributed through direct contact of the body.
A small negative effect on handwashing is that washing hands can always cause damage to the skin from the drying of the disease.
A 2012 Denmaki study showed that excessive handwashing can cause a condition of skin irritation known as handwashing or skin disease of monjno conditions especially common among medical personnel.
Washing hands each time also appears to be one of the symptoms of a mental or repeated disease (OCD).
There are five important times a day when washing hands with soap is necessary to reduce the distribution of feces to the mouth: after using the toilet (to go to a small need, go to a great need), after cleaning his need (changes his nepis), before giving him food, before eating and before/after providing food or touching raw meat, fish or breeding birds.
Other events where the correct method of handwashing should be done to prevent the distribution of the disease include before and after treating the injury; after sneezing, coughing or releasing deacons; after touching animal waste or dealing with them; after touching the waste.
In many countries, there is a low level of washing hands with soap.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 recognized that on average, 38.7% of the house were washing their hands with soap. 2014 research showed that Saudi Arabia had a higher rate of 97%; the United States around the middle and 77%; and China and the lowest rate of 23 percent of the change of behavior are currently present to increase the habit of washing hands with soap in these critical times. Washing hands to groups to school children in scheduled hours is one of the methods in developing countries taught and reminded children of their hands to wash their hands.
"The Basic Health Service Service" implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of high-profile action to promote health and child education.
Kill worms twice a year, added and washing hands daily with soap, brushing daily with a fluorini, is the basis for this national project.
It has also been able to be implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of germs from the skin has been made possible by adding soap or a severe treatment to clean up the water.
An important act of soap and severe medicine is to reduce the combination barriers, adding fluid.
Water alone is not able to clean the skin because fat and protein, which are organic soil components, are not easily absorbed in water.
Cleaning, however, is assisted by a good flow of water.
Soap the mango, for its re-use condition, can keep bacteria obtained from the original use.
A few research numbers that have handled bacterial distribution from contaminated soap have concluded that distribution is not easy to occur because bacteria are washed and removed through form.
The CDC still mentions that "uncontrolled water design in its spill is recommended".
The bacterial - killer beans have been widely broadcast to a healthy public.
To this day, there is no evidence that using the proposed antiseptic or parasiteicides selects creatures that are not killed by drugs in nature.
However, bacterial - killer soaps have common products that fight bacteria such as triclosan, which contains a long list of non-dead germs.
So even if immortal species have not been given to soap against bacteria, they may not work as effectively as they are announced.
Apart from skin protection, a combination of confederations may contain acid (austic, acid assekiki, acid of milk that is based on the co-author) as a pH, a acid that fights the benzoic germs and other skin-speeds (aloe vera, vitamins, mentha, medicine from trees). An analysis of Oregon University School of Public Health showed that conventional soaps are only as suitable as those of users to combat bacteria with triclosan in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that is all right to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster in body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot, soapy water is much better than cold water with a sabulu in removing natural oil that holds sand and bacteria.
Contrary to popular beliefs however, scientific research has shown that using water movement has no effect on reducing the waste of obedience to the hands.
An amplifier or an antiseptic is a non-water treatment for handwashing.
In the late 1990s and early 21st decade, a bath of waterless hands (which is also known as alcohol-based models, antiseptic or hand chips.) began to become popular.
Most have isopropyl or ethanoli alcohol was mixed with weight - giving organs such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) and forming oil, or a damper such as making glyrin liquid, or foam to be used quickly and reduce the effects of alcohol fluid.
Adding molten Hydrogen peroxide increases the combat of waste. Hand chips with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are suitable for the treatment of germs.
Alcohol-based alcohol products become bacteria, non-died bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, light, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccnia, flu flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based units for 70% are 99.97% (a 3.5th log reductions, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria 30 seconds after using them with 99.99% to 99.999% (a 4 to 5) of bacteria in hand 1 minutes after using them. Hand-sizes are more suitable against bacteria and are less suitable against certain viruses.
The alcohol-based hand products are almost entirely inappropriate against the norovirus (or Norwalk), which are the most common causes of gastroenteritis.A sufficient or alcohol-based drug must be used properly to supply liquid hands or cover all hands.
The front and back of all hands and in the middle and the tips of all fingers are rubbed for at least 30 seconds to liquid, foam or matus dry.
The finger tips must also be washed properly, by rubbing them on all hands. The Center for Control and Prevention of American Diseases recommends washing hands rather than using chips, especially when it is clear that hands are dirty.
The increased use of these liquids is due to the ease of its use and the rapid treatment of germs, however, he should not be used as a handwasher unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based chips can cause skin drying except the emolient organs and/or the skin smoothing organs have been added to the form.
The effects of skin drying alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glyrin and/or other emolinet organs on the form.
In clinical experiments, alcohol - containing emolients caused a low concentration of solvents and skin drying compared to other germs.
The problems of allergic reactions that are associated with skin touch, skin swelling or alcohol - related problems or alcohol - related organs did not occur much.
The lower ability to cause skin burns turned into a charm compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water products do not wash their hands from bath materials, but they become germs by them.
It is due to this reason that hand chips are not as useful as soap and water in preventing the spread of germs because the germs still remain on the hands.
The prosperity of the non - alcoholless selection depends largely on its organs and cells, and historically has not done well compared to those with alcohol.
More recently, the combinations that use the benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a stable and general activity against germs after being used, compared to alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in its efficiency after temporary use, probably due to continuing to cause serious skin problems.
Many people from low income communities cannot afford soap prices and use ash or sand instead.
The liquid or sand can be more suitable than water alone but cannot be more effective than soap.
One concern is that if sand or ash is contaminated, it can increase the impact rather than reduce its spread.
Like soap, ash is also a biological product because it is mixed with water, it produces a mixture of alkaline.
WHO recommends ash or sand as alternative soap products when soap is not available.
The correct method of washing hands proposed by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Control for the spread of disease includes the following steps:
Use warm water to wash hands or cold running water.
The flowing water is recommended because the wet can be contaminated, although water temperature does not seem to be different.
Brush your hands with a sufficient amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and even under the claws.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people are more sensitive to washing their hands with soap than only water.
Fight for at least 20 seconds.
Snailing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin and rubbing longer, eliminates even more germs.
Sell well if you use running water.
The washing of the bass can again pollute the hands.
Wash water with clean towels or allow it to dry in the air.
Hands that are liquid and moist can be easily rough. The parts that are often forgotten are thumbs, wrists, areas between the fingers and under the claws.
False claws and nail paints keep them carrying germs.
Skin - softening oil is occasionally recommended to help the hands break; dry skin can cause damage to the skin that can cause increased risk of spread.
Low-season options can be made to enable the washing of hands where the tap water and/or soap is not available for example to pour water from a well-seasoned can be made and/or using ash if necessary in nations continues. In a case where there is no sufficient water (such as schools and stem areas in developing nations), there are solutions to water storage, such as "care channels" and other low-season options.
The hanging canal is a simple technology that uses a stringed pitcher and a foot-run button to pour a little water into the hand and on a piece soap.
Proper handwashing is an important part of the handwashing process, but the debate continues on the most suitable methods of handwashing in public bath areas.
The biggest growing research suggests that paper towels is a cleaner way than electric drys in most bathrooms.
In 2008, research was conducted by Westminster University, London, and funded by the European paper manufacturer's paper manufacturer Show, to compare the standards of cleanliness provided by paper towels, dry air hands movement and the most modern-speed air-speed-air drys.
After washing and drying hands with an air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on the fingers by 194% on the palm for 254%.
The drying of the jet-air cut caused an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with tissue, the total number of bacteria decreased on the fingers by 76%na in the palm by 7%, and the scientists also experimented to determine if there was a potential pollution of other bathroom users and bathroom environments due to every type of hand drying technique.
The drying machine, which releases the unit air at a speed that is claimed to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), had the ability to blow germs from the hands and unit and the possibility of polluting other bathroom users and bathroom environments to 2 m.
The use of the air - drying of the air-speed air is spread the germs to a distance of 0.25 m from the machine.
Tishu did not show too much germs. In 2005, a study by T&V Produkt und Umult, different hand - drying techniques were assessed.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after drying hands were witnessed:
There are many manufacturers of water - drying products, and these hand - drying products have been compared to using tissue.
Washing hands with a liquid - killer hand tissue is an alternative way when you travel and there is no soap and water.
Handicide fluid is worth at least 60% of alcohol.
Washing medical hands became necessary long after an expert from Hungary, Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices used to provide answers to remind hospital workers to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has been reduced by rates of infection due to its use.
Washing hands is recommended for 15 seconds to be treated, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or oil to rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be washed together by tying the fingers.
If there is dirt under the claws, a soft brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can pray in handwater, it is important to sell well and dry hands with clean towels.
After wiping it out, these tissues are suitable to be used to close water (and open any exit door if required).
This prevents further transmission of hands from these parts.
The motive for washing hands in the health care section is to remove germs ("the bugs") and prevent them from distributing them.
The New England reports that lack of handwashing remains in many unacceptable levels in many medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients and thus distributing germs.
One study showed that properly washing hands and other simple procedures can reduce the amount of blood transplants related to katheta for 66. The World Health Organization published a table that shows common washing and rubbing hands in medical sectors.
The organization's hand-washing guide can also be found on the organization's website in public opinion.
Related investigations were conducted by Whitby and other authors.
Commercial devices can measure and confirm the purity of hands, if law enforcement shows are needed.
The World Health Organization has "Five Times" to wash hands:
after being in the possibility of touching blood/speeds of the body
before a role that can infect bacteria, and
after serving the patient. The addition of bacterial bacteria to soap (a "medical" or "in-lawed" product") enables a product used to wash hands to kill bacteria.
Such an act of killing bacteria may be required before performing surgery or in a scene where germs that are resistant to anti-regulated drugs and kill bacteria are widely present. In order to 'suck' your hands with surgery, it is necessary to have a canal that can be opened and closed without holding it by hand, the amount of chloroexini or an iotic solvent, towels executed on hand-washing parasites after washing, and a brush that was executed to rub the parasites and other equipment executed to clean up under the claws.
All the jewelry is worth being released.
This process requires washing hands and handwashing to the elbow, usually for 2–6 minutes.
A long time of rubbing (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When you sell it, the hand-side must be blocked from flowing back and back by hand.
After the time of washing the hands is completed, the hands are touched by a clothes executed parasites and the operating gas are worn.
To reduce the distribution of germs, it is good to wash hands or use a battria chemical before and after serving the patient.
With control of bacterial infection in the hospital, it has been found to be the greatest advantage from washing hands occurred in the first 20% of the washing, and that poor profit was found when the washing rate was added over 35%.
The washing of soap alone causes more than three times more than three times the amount of disease infected by bacteria spread to food compared to washing with a bacterial chemical. Compared to rubbing hands with a mixture containing alcohol and washing hands with bacterial chemicals for an average time of 30 seconds showed that rubbing hands with a mixture containing alcohol reduced bacterial infection by 26% more than a bacterial chemical soap.
But soap and water are more suitable than a mixture of alcohol - rich hands by reducing H1N1 flu virus A and Clostridium difficile cells from hands. The strategy to improve handwashing in the health care scene may involve staff education about washing hands, increasing the availability of a mixture of alcohol - containing contact, and a museum written and spoken to the staff.
There is a need for more research in which of these strategies are effective in different health care scenes.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a cheap, important tool in good health, and even good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water, handwashing equipment or soap in people’s homes, at school and working areas is a challenge in meeting the world’s handwashing behavior.
For example, most of our rurals in Africa where handwashing areas near each private or public toilet are few, even though affordable methods are available to build handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing standards can also be the result of a habit of practicing but not because of lack of soap or water.
The development and defense of washing hands with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and causing changes in people's long-term behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and assessment are essential.
A study of 70 studies found that the techniques involving society are appropriate in increasing handwashing in LMIC, with efforts to encourage society to change behavior appropriate to a low level. One of the production of handwashing in school is the "Three Stars" of UNICEF urging schools to take simple, cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning needs.
When low standards have been fulfilled, schools can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building handwashing stations can be part of the campaign to raise hands that are promoted to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign trying to bring about climate change. Due to the 2019–20-century korona virus crisis, UNICEF improved the use of handwashing.
A small number of studies have focused on the overall cost of washing hands in developing countries with connection with DALY scale.
One study, however, recommends that encouraging handwashing with soap is much cheaper than other water and cleaning strategies.
The importance of washing hands to human health - especially for people in a state of emergency such as the mother who had given birth or soldiers injured in the hospital—was first discovered in the mid-19th century by two predecessors of hand hygiene: a doctor from Hungary by the name Ignaz Semmelweis aubye worked in Vienna, Australia and Florence Nightingale, English "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time many people still believed that the infection was caused by a bad odor known as the mamas.
In 1980, the leaks caused through food and health care related to health services made the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Disease to promote perfect hygiene of hands as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The flu pandemic in 2009 and COVID-19 disaster in 2020 caused increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, banners written "right handwashing techniques" were written near handwashes in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
Article "washing your hands from" something, means declaring to someone not wanting to take responsibility for something or join others in an illegal or ethical matter.
It comes from the mistress’s passage in Matthew where Pilate washed his hands from the decision to settle Jesus Christ, but has been a key passage in some British communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Daughter Macbeth begins to wash his hands with compulsion to try to clean the supposed spot, pointing to a guilty conscience about the crime he committed and persuaded her husband to act.
It has also been discovered that people, after remembering or meditating on immoral acts, seem to wash more hands than others, and seem to appreciate more handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, those who are accepted to wash their hands after meditating on such things are less likely to engage in other acts of paying for "a desire", such as self-dependent.
Religion orders washing hands due to cleanliness and as a sign. Washing hands as signs, washing hands with water without soap, is part of the worship of washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í'í Faith , Hinduism, tevilah and netlat ofdayim in Judea, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.Dini also orders to wash hands with purity, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam order washing hands after using the toilet.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam order to wash hands before and every meal.
Risk controls at COVID-19
The risk control of COVID-19 is the use of safety techniques at work and risk control in preventing korona 2019 virus (COVID-19).
Proper risk controls in the workplace correspond to the work and work being implemented, following a review of the risk of the source of risk, the level of disease in society, and the risk factors of workers who may be infected with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Labor and Health Administration (OSHA), the work of the few at risk is limited to working people with the public and other employees, and the basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, urging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing manners, and maintaining systematic hygiene and cleaning of the work scene.
The work of the average risk includes those that need constant or close contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but are likely infected from ongoing distribution of society or international transportation.
This includes employees who interact with the public in general such as school, a work scene with a large population, and several areas of high-profile retail business.
Risk controls for this group, beyond the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using a high-profile air filter, sneezing restrictions, and personal protection equipment available if someone with COVID-19 is available.
OSHA considers health workers and remains in danger of people known or suspected of having COVID-19 to be at high risk of risk, which is increasing at greater risk if workers perform the processes that provide erosoli in, or collect and handle models, known or suspected from someone with COVID-19.
The control of the risks that these workers include engineering control such as air-based rooms with low quality and environment, and the appropriate personal protection equipment done.
COVID-19 leaks can have a lot of damage in the workplace.
Workers may be unemployed from getting sick, needing to care for others, or in fear of being at risk.
Business styles can change, in the type of products required, and access to the products (such as buying goods at times when there are few people or through delivery or service while on the car).
Finally, the export of goods from badly affected areas by COVID-19 can be interrupted. The preparation plans and response to infection can be used to lead security measures.
Plans address risk rates related to parts of different jobs and jobs, including reasons for risk, the potential impact from household and social areas, and the risk of private workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also list appropriate control to deal with these risks, and emergency plans for possible situations following the re-existing.
Preparations for infectious diseases and response plans are able to follow national or local recommendations.
The objectives of response to the re-election include reducing distribution between employees, protecting people who are more at risk for chronic medical problems, maintaining business operations, and reducing the negative impact on other organizations and involved in transporting goods.
The severity of illness in society where business is affecting the reaction taken.
The system of risk control rates is a system used extensively in professional safety and health to place in risk control according to efficiency.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be stopped, the most suitable control is engineering, followed by administrative control, and the end of personal protection equipment.
Engineering control involves separating workers from job-related risks without relying on the behavior of workers, and can be a cheap solution to implement.
The control of governance is a change in labor policies or procedures that require action by a worker or a professional.
Personal protection devices (PPE) are considered to be less effective than engineering control and governance, but they can prevent some events of risk.
All types of PPE must be selected according to danger to the worker, and well worn as required (k.m., respiratory aid machines), each time and well worn, checked from time to time, maintained, and replaced, and properly removed, cleaned, and placed or thrown away.
According to the U.S. Labor and Health Safety Administration, the work of a few at risk is in conflict with people working with the public and other employees.
The basic measures to prevent the proposed exposure to all work scenes include constant and good washing, urging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing manners including covering cough and sneezing, releasing tissue and trash barrels, preparing by working from home or working on shifts that were maintained if necessary, advising workers not to use the equipment of others, and maintaining the cleanup of coordination and cleaning of the work scene.
The quick discovery and isolation of people who are thought to be infected is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that workers with symptoms of chronic respiratory disease are fit to stay at home until they are less hot, signs of high temperature, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of high temperatures or coping with symptoms, and that the vacation policies of illness change according to circumstances, allowing workers to stay at home to serve a family member who is ill, and that workers are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, the work of being at average risk includes those that require regular contact with people or be close to people between six feet (1.8 m) who are unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing social distribution near the business area, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a large area of COVID-19.
This includes employees who are in general contact with the public such as in schools, a multi-specific work scene, and other parts of the business rejereja with many people. The engineering controls for this and the most likely groups include keeping high-profile air filters, increasing air-based standards, setting restrictions such as the clear restrictions of sneezing, and setting a window through the drive through the service of customers. The control of the administration to this group and other endangered personnel is to encourage the staff to stay at home, change the face-to-face meetings and communications, to start the work of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process, and the use of the use of the public's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the services of the staff, and the use of the use of the services of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the services of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the services of the staff, and the use of the services of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the environment of the use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the environment, and the use of the use of the staff's use of the environment, and the use of the services of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of the services of the community, and the use of the use of the environment, and the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the environment, and the use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the environment, and use of the use of the use of the use of the staff's use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the services of the staff, and the use of the use of the use of
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use a respiratory aid machine.
If a person becomes ill in a plane, a good stability to protect the crew and other passengers includes separating a sick person and others at 6 feet, choosing one flight worker to handle the patient, giving him a patient's face or asking the patient to cover their mouth and noses and tissue when he coughs or sneezing.
Air workers are fit to wear medical gloves that you can throw when serving sick passengers or touch body fluids or areas that may have been infected, and if possible more self - protection equipment if sick passengers are too hot, coughed, or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other tools thrown after use are not suitable to be thrown into special hospital waste bags, and infected areas are suitable for the removal and cleaning of medicine later. By ship transport, including luxury ships and other passenger equipment, risk controls include the journey if you are sick, and separate and inform the health center immediately if one has a temperature or other symptoms while he is on the vessel.
It is appropriate, medical monitoring takes place in the room of a isolated person. For schools and child protection facilities, CDC proposes a temporary closure to wipe or clean up with medication if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of social distribution.
While there are few distributions to social average, non-competitive techniques can be implemented such as interrupting educational trips, meetings, and other large conventions such as sports sessions or training of the choirs or meals in restaurants, increasing space between desks, relaxing the times of arrival and departure, reducing the number of unwanted visitors, and using a different area of health office for children who have symptoms such as influenza.
While there is a major social impact, by talking about strategies not to be close to each other, the closure of more school can be considered. For law enforcement ministers working on daily operations, the current danger is considered to be below by CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact certified or suspected people with COVID-19 are nominated to follow the instructions such as emergency medical technicians, as well as real defensive equipment.
If there is a close contact at the time of being taken, workers should clean and purify their belt and work equipment before reuse them with a spray or home cleaning unit, and follow the usual processes to work with the PPE and to keep and wash the clothes.
Osha considers other workers and staff of the corpse storage room to be at high risk or in the high risk of infection.
Works that have high risk include healthcare, assistance, laboratory, medical personnel who have contacted known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These works are highly dangerous to be infected if workers are implementing aerosoli production processes, or collecting or handling sampiulis from known patients or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosoli production processes include inserting tube into the esoph, bronkospi, some processes and dental observations, or sample collection by injection,
High-profile tasks of the corpse storage room include staff involved in providing bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 units during their farewell; these become high-profile tasks if they carry out a corpse investigation. The additional engineering controls of these risk groups include the isolation rooms of patients known or suspected of having COVID-19, including when the production processes of the aerosoli are implemented.
Special transmission of positive air of motivation can be appropriate in some health care patterns and corpse storage rooms.
Samples should be handled with a 3rd Standard Safety alert.
The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that patients entering to be isolated in special waiting areas according to whether they are suspected of having COVID-19.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends breathing machines for those working about 6 feet of patients who are known to be, or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who implement the production processes of aerosoli.
In the United States, N95 facial breathing machines approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of the complete written process of the liquid system that includes, measuring fit, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respiratory machines can provide greater immunity and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO recommends ovaroli, as COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is infected through body fluids.
WHO proposes the operating units alone for a study minister in the entry area.
For those who collect samples of the respiratory system starting to care for them, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosili production procedures, WHO recommends surgery, glasses, facial shield, gauni, and glove.
If the production process is implemented, the operating plant is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respiratory aid machine.
Since PPE's international acquisition is not enough, WHO proposes to reduce PPE's needs through the transfer of medical notes, physical restrictions such as clear windows, to allow those involved only in the direct service to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, using the only PPE essential for the specific work, continuing to use the breathing machine without removing it while serving several patients with the same recognition, monitoring and scheduling the PPE supply column, and not encouraging the use of the continent for people with symptoms.

MADE: [Covid-19] Resting the load and providing the future
TARE/SULTS: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LESENI: CC0: No rights preserved
We find ourselves in special circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 tragedy is something that makes it clear our close human relationship in the world and the commitment we have for ourselves.
We have no first place for its challenges, but we do not know that our best answers depend on the kind of emotion-spouse in the world, cooperation, and social creation that is the heart of this organization.
The faith and friendship and concern we have among all our partners through emails, telephones, and soga are the unique validity of good humans with whom we have been lucky to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to rely on all of you as my comrades.
Last week, there was someone who shared with me thanks for our work.
He reminded me of the world's importance to be able to use Wikipedia right now, and the main mark is for this important resource to pray online and the availability of all people.
Your work makes this possible, whether it is to keep stations working or our colleagues paid or our community safe.
The world needs an explanation Wikipedia gives, this time more than ever.
This is a time when not just what we do, but how we do it, will bring significant results in the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your work to him, we'll be making some important adjustments about how we work together, starting this next week.
Reform to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team c met last night to discuss our way and schedule of days and months to come.
In the discussion, we considered what we thought would be the correct answer to what we are going through and the best way to develop the organization at this time.
Ironically all of us wanted to remove the tribulation and support our long-term mission.
If you want to call us, that's all right.
For workers, montrakta, and all contract staff:
Our daily job prospects will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until an unknown time.
We don't watch vacation - if you can work for more regular hours, our mission can use you.
However, this world cannot be predicted at present, and whether you need to care for your loved ones, get vegetables, or go to the doctor, your interests are our priority.
We do not pursue your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should be clear, but we say it.
No days of illness or PTO are required - just tell your manager and help your team through calendars and schedules to ensure the main areas of the work have been handled.
(If you are found to have COVID-19, please tell Bryana at T&C Ops to know so that T&C can help you with help and ensure your situation can be well considered by management).
The workers working for an hour will be paid all the money.
We have already said, and we are again committed to respect our promises to our montrakta and our staff working for an hour.
Everyone will be paid on the grounds of his regular hours they worked during normal circumstances.
This includes if you're sick and you can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to deal with their tribulation and our world.
What we do can be very satisfying, especially at this time.
Again, this involves caring for yourself.
What we ask is that you contact our manager, so that we can know what we should expect and be able to fix what is.
Other tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising (between other teams) perform important tasks that may require additional assistance.
We will start all the process and departments to assess current goals and we can aim to support what is important to our mission.
There are many things to do for all of us, all of us will focus on the most important goals.
Speed reduction now will not be harmful later.
We don't plan to go for "more time to compensate" soon as this tragedy passes.
You will not be expected to work overtime to reach conclusions that are currently impossible.
We agree that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and time if possible.
What happens by APP (The Annual Planning)?
To adjust to our new truth and the prospects of working hours daily, we aim to adjust the delivery of our 2020–2021 Annual Program.
Our goal is to recommend an extension of our 2019–2020 plan that allows more time to budget to allow our employees to give priority to the important work, self-care, and care for their loved ones while keeping those who need or want to work for a reduced time for the next few weeks.
The extension of this time reduces the current sword and pressure work in the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Committee next week and we will inform the delegates and teams about the following steps as soon as possible as we have evidence.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Office status, intervention, and cleanup
Last week, we knew that one of our partners in SF may have been infected with COVID-19 virus.
With great lecturers, however, we hired the cleaning workers to purify all areas in the San Francisco office.
They used a viral killer used in the hospital to purify everywhere, even in the hall and stairs reaching our floor.
The building uses its own care role that uses products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel good that the office will be well provided for the time when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 and we and all the employees in DC.
Until last week, our DC office moved its jobs to be given away according to instructions shared by San Francisco.
According to the understanding of some of our fellows in NYC, we have also been discussing housing in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work far away for the first time.
Wenzetu who worked for a long time know that it could be difficult to adjust, and they wanted to give reasonable advice:
Reduce the length of meetings by an increase of one or two hours.
If long sessions are needed, consider how they can be separated over a period of days.
Describe the meeting clearly, having a agenda, and mission early reading resources.
Make the video a choice-based, and tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to enable direct cooperation and combination.
Having a leader to enable each meeting, a soga tracker for questions and tracking the list of speakers, and someone to help write quotes (or share in writing quotes).
Send an email with technical assistance if you need a good head device.
Use your well-being compensation to buy snacks.
Join #remoties at Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work distributed
HR Operations team considers the guidance of the web environment to help in the increase in the work distributed in Dedication.
This past week we asked all recipients of social welfare to regret all the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edathons, until WHO announces this disaster is over.
We informed them that we understand that our request for regret and other obstacles could make it difficult to complete their approved grant operations and that no one will be punished for delaying or correcting those goals.
This next week we will follow additional instructions on Wikimania and other regional conferences and the topical community.
A general view from world societies seems to express sorrow for discomfort but comfort to the clarity and ability to target their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
To advance, CRT is dealing with setting a page about Meta-Wiki to provide space for society to track the results and track our communication with them.
Continue to communicate on issues related to COVID-19
We'll be sending an invitation to your calendar on the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will take this time to share additional additions, answer your questions and take time to be united with themselves.
We're together and we're here to help in any way we can.
Currently, you can continue to search for explanations from this email, and all other important explanations related to COVID-19, at Office Wiki.
CRT will shake these pages and all the details in one place.
We also deal with maintaining frequent communication with workers living in countries that have been affected by the current impact.
If you have any questions about transportation, events, great work, or the challenge of reaching, or anything else that you may need help, please do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We're here to help provide needed assistance and cooperation.
If you have a private or sensitive issue, please send an email to Bryanm Judan - Director of HR International Operations.
None of these changes should seem to be abandoned by your work and responsibilities.
Rather, it is a realization that in the meantime, our work and responsibilities are likely to change in a way we have not seen before.
These are the steps we believe are essential in joining the hand so that we can continue working, giving our movement the necessary assistance, and the world the services they can rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when time will come.
Currently, it is time to help one another and create an important role that will be coming in the weeks and months to come.
We need all of you to help you, and so we need all of you to protect you from our families so that you can be in good condition when the need will arise.
For now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doraen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the remaining Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The 2 enzyme to turn b'Angiotensin (ACE2) is an enzyme that was threatened with the outer part (the cell network) of cells in lungs, veins, heart, kidney and gut.
ACE2 faces activities related to enzyme that transforms angiotensin (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotens-II and adding Ang(1–7) by making it a good treatment for heart disease. ACE2 also serves as part of entering the cell of some koronavirus.
Man's enzyme edition is referred to from time to time as hACE2.
The 2 enzyme to convert angiotensin is zinc containing enzymes of metal atoms located in the final cell nerve area and other cells.
ACE2 protein has a M2 pepptide team of temino N and a team to transport amino acid acid of kolektini temino C
ACE2 is a single-way membrane protein, its used digestive organ in the upper part of the cell in the lungs and other tissues.
The giligili outside ACE2 has held a membrane for another enzyme known as shedase, and the resulting liquid protein is released from the blood system and eventually released through urine.
ACE2 is found in many organs: ACE2 has been attached to the alveola cell membrane II types of lungs, enerosati of a small gut, veins and final veins and soft muscle cells in many organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in brain membranes, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain system.
ACE2's main work is to work as ACE's imagination.
ACE develops the hormone I of angiotensin on angiotensin II of blood pressure.
His ACE2 side is lit with carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and breaks it into angiotensin of vasodilator (1–7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also be attached to several links including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apenin, neurotensin, dysnorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the transport of the travel membrane SLC6A19 of natural amino and is cited by Hartnup's disease.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 is used as the main component of entering the cells of some korona virus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS CoV (Russian that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (Russians that cause COVID-19).
In particular, the combination of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV protein for the ACE2 organ in the upper cell causes endocytosis and viral transfer and enzyme to endosoms within the cell.
This entry process also requires protein processing S and anti-specific protein-based TMPRSS2, a prevention that is currently being investigated as possible treatment. This has caused others to assume that reducing the levels of ACE2, in the cell, can help cope with the transmission.
However, many professional and administrative organizations have proposed continuing the usual ACE and ARB treatment.
System review and metre analysis published on 11 July 2013, found that "the use of ACE restrictions was associated with a significant 34% decline in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced to patients treated by ACE restrictions who had a high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
The use of ACE restrictions was also combined with declining deaths related to pneumonia, although the results were weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 connected human (rhACE2) has been considered a new treatment for severe lung injury, and seemed to improve the circulation of blood and oxygen in small pigs with a severe respiratory disorder.
Half-life of rhACE2 for humans is 10 hours and will start working after 30 minutes with the cause of the results (time) at 24 hours.
Several results indicate that rhACE2 may be a good drug for those who cannot tolerate the restrictions of the renin-angiotensin (AS's restrictions) or in diseases where angiotensin II surrounding ima love. The rhACE2 mix has been estimated in clinical tests for treatment of chronic respiratory problems.
COVID-19 programs are a prodium-use of mobile phones designed to help find people who have been inducted to handle the korona 2019-20 virus disease, namely a process of identifying people ("people who met them") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many programs were made or proposed, and official government assistance in several districts and territories.
Several systems to create prorams to search for people who have wandered are designed.
Private issues have been suggested, especially about systems that depend on monitoring the geographic area of software users.
Non-specific substitutes include the use of Bluetooth signals to place the user's close area on other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple unanimously announced that they would connect operations to accept the Bluetooth directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has provided a program that allows citizens to look at if they are in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It serves over 200 Chinese towns. In Singapore, a proframu called TraceTogether is used.
The program was produced by the local community and IY, released as a clear source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a program based on Bluetooth to find infected people who can spread and provide immediate response to the health care authority.
The program was produced by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Health Wiraza.
Retrieved 14 April 2020, the program was waiting to be approved by Google Play Store and Appple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the search program was in the top stages of development, and will be used after a few weeks. The same program is planned in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand focus on the program according to the TraceTogether program of Singapoo and BlueTrace's utile. Russia expects to establish a program based on the area of patients found to have COVID-19 living in Moscow, which was designed to be confirmed not home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed several functional problems of software systems, including a good false view and possible lack of efficiency if the use of software is limited to a small number of people.
To address problems about the distribution of "the koronavirus" programs for misleading or bad, Apple places restrictions on what kind of organizations can set up programs related to the korona virus in its Program Store, preventing only those who are "rasmi" or other prominent organizations.
Google and Amazon have also used the restrictions.
Private campaigners expressed concern over the impact of a large population investigation using a koronavirus pro-reference, especially about whether the study infrastructure designed to deal with koronavirus will be threatened after the disease is controlled.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have released a report saying that restrictions should be placed in this type of investigation
The organizations announced four conditions in government projects:
The investigation must be "right, important, and consistent";
must be continued monitoring and investigation to have temporary rules;
The use of data is forced to have restrictions for COVID-19 purposes.
data security and unknown must be protected and shown to be protected according to evidence;
digital investigation must avoid increasing discrimination and isolation;
must share all data with other characters to be defined by law;
There must be protection against violence and civil justice to deal with violence;
The significant participation of "all the important auctions" will be required, including public health experts and isolated groups. Chaos Computer Club of Germany (CCC) and Writers Without Block (Reportist ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also released a survey list.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to settle the problem of continuing investigation by removing the process of re-existing from their device's operating system after it is no longer needed.
Other countries used web-based monitoring rather than software, removing the need to download software and ability and avoid searching.
In Israel, a web-based surveillance was accepted.
A web-based analysis that has access to the real data of the area has important problems that are possible for privacy.
However, not all systems with the main seva need to have access to personal data; several private care systems are designed that use only the main seva for communication (see the section below).
In South Korea, a non-specific system was used to make a search for the people who had been in contact with each other.
Instead of using one program, the system collected search details from sources to kill including the search data for a mobile device and card-selling data, and included these to release arifa through text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this explanation to inform possible people, the government has also made the local explanation available to the public, something allowed due to the change in private law of explanation after the MERS explosion in the country.
This explanation is available to the public through several programs and websites. Several countries including Germany focused on using major and private systems.
By 6 April 2020, the explanation has not been made.
The search for people whose privacy has been preserved is a well established concept, and a former-started group in 2013. Until 7 April 2020, many groups of experts were dealing with private solutions that are easy to use, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to keep the user's close area on other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is an effort to coordinate which has all the means of one authority and authority to kill, and not one consensus. The authority-in-chiefs include the Search for the Near Site whose Private Private Is Archived by Authority Anuwai (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Number of the Time Asians (TCN, fka Number of the Asians of the Event, CEN), Private Identifications and Tracking Methods of Phone Communications (PCT) and others.
These ziks, personal data that can be detected is not available on the device, and all comparisons are made on the device.
The Private group has been producing SafePaths, a search for using private storage techniques during collecting and using area or data to monitor COVID-19 infections.
Based on research from the hitipoper "The ‹ Has Been Lagai: Keeping Personal Private Private in the Explosion" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technology that was also established in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe software to allow users to participate in a sensitive area and health data for users and other officials, without affecting the privacy of the data.
On 5 April, the TCN international cooperation was established by groups that had been associated with similar techniques and the corresponding utilis, with the aim of reducing division, and enabling international cooperation of search and awareness programs, an important part of achieving large uses.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapoo government announced that it opened the BlueTrace's consensus used by its official government program.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Appe, companies that control Android and iOs telephone platforms, announced a plan to find people who had been inducted, which claimed to be private defenders, according to the combination of Bluetooth Low Enerygy technology and the cover of private conservation.
They also published the introduction of the basic technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three stages:
providing tools to enable governments to create official search programs for people with korona virus that protects privacy
The combination of this operation directly in iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple's plan to address ongoing research problems by first distributing the system through the transmission of the operating system, and later removing it in a similar way after the threat has ended.
The replacement of drugs (also known as using other drugs, setting new shape, causing new work or changing drugs) is to release a licensed drug for treatment of different diseases or medical condition rather than using it for the original cause.
This is one way of scientific research that is currently being pursued to promote safe treatment and COVID-19's field.
Other research guidelines include the cultivation of COVID-19 vaccines and takes protection of a man who recovered and sent them to a patient through blood. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 pharmaceutical proteins, each with many molecular areas.
Critically critical of these connecting areas provides a good project to create a better anti-virus drug that will release COVID-19 proteins.
The most targeted SARS-CoV-2 proteins are protease as shark, RNA based on RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphotase.

On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its savings, and use the military to send the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an earlier conversation with Trump's administration about buying the drug, which may not be a factor for severe illness where viruses have already increased.
It may not be safe to be used by pregnant women or those who are trying to get pregnant.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir virus and ritonavir, concluded that "no profit was seen".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from releasing copies by scoring with protease.

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a fictional vaccine to prevent the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19).
Although no panel completed clinical tests, there are several ongoing attempts to create the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2, a virus that causes the disease, found in less than 18 months.
Five selected vaccines were in the I Awamu's security research in April.
COVID-19 was recognized in December 2019.
A global explosion in 2020, resulting in large investment and research operations.
Many organizations use genomes published to create possible vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
When mentioned in April, the needs of the CEPI program for development of vaccines are fast, production capacity, moderate consumption, and access to the world.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and advanced in early 2020 to create a suitable vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The main objectives of the jukwa continued in the I Awamu security research include:
Cell cell acid (DNA and RNA) (I's phase producer and selected vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus surveillance tools (I and the designated panel: CanSino Biologics, adeno virus of the type 5).
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 selected vaccines are being developed in the early stages, with 78 confirmed as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been announced, but with a few details available to the public (thought to be planned or formed).
The I-II Awamu test runs an early safety attempt and imunogeniti, usually not following a special procedure, controlled through a platinum and in the areas of the awai, while identifying the most accurate and faf.
The III phase test usually involves more participants, including a group of dissertation, and assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while following the negative effects on the best measure.
Of the 79 selected vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April), 79 vaccines were not made to man (still in research "before clinical testing").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it is conducting a study of possible molecular vaccine that can change the virus proteins to stimulate the immune system.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Tattoo Center (VIDO-InterVac) at Saskatchewan University began to begin handling vaccines, aimed at the start of blood testing in 2021.
The development projects of vaccines were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2929, and Hong Kong University on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they began handling vaccines.
Janssen develops vaccines in conjunction with its biotechnology partners, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolations announced the production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.

On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolated people, and that even quickly following it would take at least one and a half to two years to create vaccines.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of cells such as a korona virus under the scholarship of sehemi from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
A vaccine test is in laboratory research, and a human test plan is planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trumo released CureVac, "a large amount of money for the unique reach of Covid-19 vaccine", which the German government opposed.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical Company Pfizer announced collaboration with the German BioNTech company to form a vaccine based on mRNA.
The selected vaccine that supports mRNA, BN162, is currently measured by animals and the clinic ratings are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, the Italian biotechnological company announced that they would have a test for animals in April 2020 and the last selected vaccine can begin to be tested during the leaf-speed season.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Discovery of Eruptions (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in the study of COVID-19 vaccines involving Pasteur Institute, Themis Biosciece (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, and bringing the total investment of CEPI's development of COVID-19 vaccine to be $29 million.
Other members of CEPI investment for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Modema, Curevac, Innovaio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun testing animals with six selected vaccines.
Imperial College researchers in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing the strongest RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The selected vaccine was provided within 14 days of receiving order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 million programs for medical testing research against COVID-19, including several vaccines selected in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medical plans and University of Saskatchewan.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government announced 192 million dollars to develop a COVID-19 vaccine alone, with plans to establish a national "date vaccine" of several new vaccines that can be used if another korona virus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, Pittsburgh University researchers reported measuring PittCoVac, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, saying that "MNA released a small SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines persuaded a powerful antigen—a special response to antibodies [in the mouse] which appeared to be an idea from 2 weeks after the vaccine."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, Waterloo University of the School of Medicine announced a selected vaccine based on DNA as a possible steel drug.
Using bacteria, DNA will be made from copies within a human bacterium to release cells like harmless viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to release the immune system against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industry, and three American universities provided the resources to reach the main computer from IBM, as well as the resources to provide computer services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Other vaccines have different effects, also known as non-special effects.
This means that they can be more beneficial than a disease that prevents it.
More random attempts in Australia are seeking to hire 4,170 health care workers.
It is possible that the vaccines developed were unsafe or will not bring the expected results.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using special covid-19 units of animalists, such as ACE2 with genes from mice, other laboratory animals, and other non-human cells, shows the need for a 3rd-century blockage of infectious cell safety, and international coordination to ensure safety processes.
Vaccination against SARS and MARS have been measured in examples of nonhuman animals.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that have been shown safe by the expected results for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, recognition and growth of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world.There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MARS began to spread, it was believed that SARS's current research can provide an important model for developing vaccines and treatment against MERS-CoV infections.
Until March2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based DNA) that completed tests of the I's phase of clinics for humans, and three others continue, all of which are a vaccine to prevent viruses, two DNA virus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications have developed a controversial theory claiming that the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and that vaccines were already available.
The patents mentioned by various social media publications refer to existing patents of the electronic series and vaccines for another type of korona virus such as SARS koronavirus.
The korona 2019 virus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the korona virus of severe respiratory problems (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat lesions, odor loss, and abdominal pain.
From the time of infection and symptoms seen by the auction is about five days but can start on the second or fourteenth day.
While a large number of cases cause severe symptoms, some promote viral pneumonia or organs to stop working.
By 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 nations and asylums, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, especially among people who wander closely, often through small drops given when they cough, sneeze, or talk.
Although these drops are produced when it grows out, they fall on the floor or on areas rather than infect each other in a long distance.
People can also be infected by touching an infected area and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live in areas until 72 hours.
It is more infected in the first three days after the symptoms have been seen, although its spread is possible before the symptoms appear and in later stages of illness. The common process of investigating the real-time adaptation of polymeras (rRT-PCR) from the cells released in the nose.
People who suspect that their virus and adoptives are recommended to use the baroa.
Public recommendations generally wear a continent differ, with some authorities suggesting their non-use, some suggesting that they be used and others want people to use them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or special treatment to protect COVID-19 virus.
Internal infections have been reported in many countries for all six WHO areas.
Those infected with the virus may be wrong with exposure to symptoms or symptoms such as flu, fatigue, and respiratory problems.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory problems, pain or pressure going on in the chest, confusion, walking problems, and face or mouth of blue; it is advised to seek treatment if these symptoms exist.
Unusual; symptoms in the upper part of breathing such as sneezing, like noses or throat pain can be seen.
Symptoms in the stomach such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea have been observed in different percent.
Other cases in China showed stress in the chest and only heart attacks.
In other cases, illness may remain pneumonia, limbs kill him from working and death.
This is known as a period of maturity.
The COVID-19 mature period is usually five to six days but can range from second or fourteen.
97.5 percent of people who show symptoms will show within 11.5 days after infection. Ripits indicate that not all infected will show symptoms.
The role of these non-remarked evangelists in infections is still totally unknown, however, the original evidence shows that they can contribute to the distribution of the disease.
The ratio of people infected with abao does not show signs is not currently known and is researched, and Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting 20% of all confirmed people continued to fail to show signs in the hospital.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include people who do not show signs in their daily cases on 1 April; 166 people infected that day, 130 people (78%) did not show signs during testing.
The cough and saliva can have high levels of viruses,
Sound speaking is more drops than normal conversation.
Research at Singapoo showed that uncovering cough could cause drops to 4.5 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus cannot be spread into the air, the National Academy of Sciences has proposed that it can infect each other through air particles and air collectors in the way outside the rooms had positive samples of RNA virus.
Some medical procedures such as the introduction of the tube and raising the heart and lungs (CPR) can cause asthma fluids to be converted into air and thus cause air-specifics.
Although there is concern that it can be spread through feces, this danger is believed to be low, which can be highly transmitted when people show symptoms; although infections are possible before symptoms appear, its risk is low.
The European Center for Information and Disease Control (ECDC) states although it is unclear how the disease is spreading, one person generally infects two or three others, and the virus stays on the spread of hours until several days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detected for a day on the cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and steel (304), and up to four hours on 99% bronze.
This, however, varies according to humidity and heat.
Soap and cleaning medicine are also best if used properly; soap products weaken the immune range of viral fat, maiming its strength, and also releasing them from skin and other areas.
Other fluids, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a operating process), are not working well. In research in Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on an average of two days after starting to be hospitalized.
Among six patients, the first sample showed the highest rate of viruses and sixth patient showed the highest rate of virus on the second day of testing.
A severe respiratory disorder, koronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new korona virus of severe respiratory problems,
All the elements of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus appear in viruses related to the korona in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is eaten by a home-based seven, which splits its immune bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because viruses reach viral cells via enzaim angiotensin-turning enzaim 2 (ACE2), which are widely found in the II alveorar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special gliprotin of areas known as "spike" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 and enter the native cell.
A severe heart injury was found in 12% of people infected and hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is occurring extensively in severe illness.
The rates of symptoms of heart disease are high, due to the disease of response to sedition and immune system during the development of the disease, but a severe heart wall injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receivers are very visible in the heart and are involved in heart function.
Many cases of heart umbrella (31%) and blood begin to freeze in a vein (25%) have been found for ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with poor predictions. A study of dead dead dead due to COVID-19 has found special changes due to the disease (DAD), and lymph-genye cells in tumors within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV 2 has a ACE-2 growth featuring cells that stretch your body's faces in the respiratory system, patients with COVID-19 severe have symptoms of systemic hypopainflamation.
In particular, T cells from GM-CSF germs that fell in accordance with the use of monotics that release IL-6 of tumors and causes severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
A rare skin disease has also been reported during blood tests.
WHO has published several of the traumas of the disease.
The standard test method is in the research laboratory to monitor genetic access (rRT-PCR).
The study is usually done on breath samples obtained by a sample of the test of the nose clinic; however; a sample of kohozi and saliva can also be used.
The overall results are available within hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they need two blood samples that took two weeks apart and the results have a low value.
Chinese scientists were able to set aside the stress of the korona virus and the genetic series so that laboratories around the world can develop the ratings of special DNA sample to detect the virus's transmission.
As of April 2020, immune measurements (which can detect serious infections and if the person had previously been infected) were going on but not widely used.
Chinese testing experience has shown accuracy only 60 to 70 percent.
FDA in the United States approved the first medical attempt on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of the month. The recognition guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuham University gave up the methods of detecting infections according to the characteristics of clinics and the risk of epidemic diseases.
Two soft-sized and many metals with side parts used to study asthma cords ,
The presence of Subpleural in abundance, the evil way (the fat related to the lobular and the different alveolasi servant), and connecting can be seen as the disease continues.
A few Datas are available about minor lesions and COVID-19 pathology.
The main results of the corpse investigation are:
Eye examination: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung filled with liquid instead of air and water collection in tissue and lung air space.
Four types of viral pneumonia are being studied:
Non-specific nimonary oedema, pneumocyte hypoplasia, charge atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflamation with lymphocytic infilation and the structure of a large cell.
Nimonia: special changes in the lungs due to lung disease (DAD) liquid from the lungs.
DAD is filled with acute respirary distress syndrome (ARDS) and sharp hiposemia.
A healing pneumonia: liquid release in the gaps of gum and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: serious problems where proteins that control blood clots become more cautious (DIC);
Defense measures to reduce infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water occasionally for at least 20 seconds, training to have good cough manners and avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth and hands that are not washed.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when you cough or sneeze and suggests using it inside the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene after a cough or sneezing is urged.
CDC has proposed using the surface restrictions on the public environment, to prevent infection from a person who shows symptoms. The isolation from society aims to reduce integration with infected people in large groups by closing schools and working places; preventing transportation and banning large public tensions.
Guides to stay away also include people to stay away at least 6 feet (6 m).
There is no known drug to work to prevent COVID-19. Although no vaccine is expected until 2021 as soon as possible, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the rate of the explosion, known as "reducing infection"
CDC also suggests that people wash their hands occasionally with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt is seen on the hands, before eating and after such a spell, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using alcohol - rich handcuts at least 60% of germs, but it is when soap and water are not available. In areas where the alcohol - rich hand cleaners are not readily available, WHO provides a formula for internal production.
In these structures, the diplomatic activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanoli.
Hidrojeni peroxide is used to help remove bacterial seeds from alcohol; not "a substance used for hand labels"
Gliseroli is added as a substance used to keep things moist.
People are treated with care, which may include using liquids such as treatment, oxygen aid, and treatment of other affected organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have these viruses wear a common continent.
The external respiratory device (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory problems, but its benefits are still being considered.
Physical hygiene and healthy life have been recommended to improve immunity.
Treatment can be used for those who show less severe symptoms at the beginning of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published proposals to care for people admitted to hopitian due to COVID-19.
Doctors of critical condition and lung doctors in the United States have included medical recommendations from organizations to kill him as a free resource, IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no special COVID-19 treatment.
In symptoms, some experts recommended paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first choice to use.
A caution must be maintained to reduce viral infections, especially in the health care environment during the process that can provide erosoli, such as putting tube or passing air to the patient by hand.
For health professionals who treat people with COVID-19, CDC recommends putting someone in the Air Contagion Room (AIIR) as well as using common reviews, the concerns of people who have touched each other with air-based alerts.CDC offers a guide on how to use Self-protective Tools (PPE) during a major disaster.
The proposed clothing is: PPE's gas, breath or baroa, eye care and gloves. When available, breathing (rather than the mainland) is recommended.
N95's albums have been approved for industrial environments but FDA has approved the continent to be used under Emergency Use (EUA).
They are designed to protect against flying cells such as dust but its effectiveness against special biological cells is not guaranteed for undiscorporated use.
When the mainland is not available, CDC recommends using facial barriers, or as a final option, homemade land.
Most COVID-19 events are not too severe to require air-speed or substitutes, but it is needed for a large percentage of events.
The type of respiratory aid for people with respiratory problems related to COVID-19 is being researched for people in the hospital, and some evidence that keeping the tube can be avoided by a high-profile ventilation device.
It is unclear whether one of these two causes equal benefits to people who are seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer to use air - conditioning reactors when available because this method reduces liquid cells compared to a high-profile air conditioning device. Strong events are common for older people (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds for everyone, which reduces the capacity of the health system to address the sudden COVID-19 events that are too severe to need hospital admission.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to the units of people in critical condition, 2.3% needed breathing machines and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 , were eventually admitted to a critical room.
It is more difficult to use air conditioning reactors as a severe respiratory disorder (ARDS) occurs with COVID-19 and is becoming increasingly difficult to increase oxygen.
Air transmission devices that can control pressure and PEEP are required to increase oxygen emissions and still reduce the risk of lung injury related to air transmission device
The top PEEP may be not available in old air importers.
A possible medical study began in January 2010, and several antivirus drugs are being tested for clinics.
Remdesivir seems to bring good results.
Although a new drug can reach 2021 to be developed, a number of drugs measured have already been approved for other uses or are more measured.
A virus prevention can be used by people with severe illness.
WHO proposed volunteers to participate in effective and safety tests of possible treatment. FDA has issued temporary permission to distribute antibodies as experimental treatment in events where the person's life has been severely threatened or immediately.
It has not been reviewed by clinical research needed to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a telephone program and handled the outbreak.
Users are asked to share their name and identity number.
The program can discover "the person you have moved around" by placing data on investigation and thus being able to detect the potential danger and infection.
Each user can also look at the situation of three other users.
If the possible risk has been discovered, the program does not only recommend isolation, but also informs domestic health officials. A major analysis of phone data, facial awareness technology, mobile phone monitoring and machine awareness serves to track infected and intersected people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapoo.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to monitor mobile data of people believed to have a korona virus.
The move was taken to ensure that they have withdrawn and protected those who can interact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom participated in the general data of the telephone area and the German federal government organization, Robert Koch Institute, to do research and prevent the virus from spreading.
Russia spread facial recognition technology to discover them to break the karantian law.
Giulio Gallera, Italian provincial health Commissioner, said that he has been informed by mobile phone providers that "40% of the people just go on walking-walk".
The German government operated a computer program event and over 42.000 participants.
Also, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for innovative solutions against the spread of the korona virus.
People may suffer tribulations, travel restrictions, medical effects or fear of infections themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connoe saying, "The rise in isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economics is a good method of harming mental health and well-being."
The disease may have fewer symptoms or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as colds.
A severe illness usually recovers within two weeks, where people with severe or serious illness may take three or six weeks to recover.
pregnant women may be at high risk of infection by COVID-19 according to data compared to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. For other people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
For the most affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly become a chronic respiratory disease (ARDS) that causes total failure, ogan or ogan infections to kill him unable to work.
Problems related to COVID-19 include bacterial disease, blood clots, heart damage, kidney and liver.
Blood frozen, especially the temporary increase of prothrombin, is described in 6% of those hospitalized due to COVID-19, where unusual kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20–30% of people with COVID-19 show multiple liver enzymes (high liver damage units)
According to the report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, and five days used for hospital admission.
However, patients transferred to a critical room had an average of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In an early examination, the average time to show the initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the full rate of six to 41 days.
In a survey by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8% death rate where women had a 1.7% death rate.
Histopathology measurements of post-dead lung samples show some changes in the lung structure and severe respiratory disease in all lungs.
The major changes between cells were also seen in gum cells.
The lung image is similar to severe respiratory problems (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was seen by increased levels of troponni or heart attack.
According to March data from the United States, 89 percent of those hospitalized had previous conditions. Access to medical resources and regional social and economic conditions can also affect the condition of death.
Estimates of deaths from this condition vary due to these provincial differences, but also due to special strategy problems.
A low number of non-violent cases can lead to an estimated death rate.
However, the fact that death is the result of previously infected people may mean that the current death rate has been ignored.
Smokingers were more likely to have COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more than needing special treatment or death compared to non-smokers. Questions have been given about the time the disease will be.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority became the rate dropped to 20 to 30 percent in lung capacity for people who recovered from the disease, lung measurements showed the destruction of the ogan.
This can also lead to health problems that remain after a severe illness recovers.
By March 2020, it was unknown if the previous release provided a suitable and long-term defense within the victims of the disease.
Defense looks like possible, according to the behavior of other korona viruses, but there is a report of events that people have recovered COVID-19 and are accompanied by positive levels of korona virus in the future.
These events are believed to be increasing in long-term infections rather than new resolutions.
The virus is thought to be natural and from animals, through spread infections.
Its source is unknown but by December 2019, the infection was due to infections from person to person.
A study of the first 41 events of COVID-19 controlled, published on January 2020 in The Lancet, showed the first date the symptoms began is 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported that the first signs to appear were on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to measure the mortality rate.
These numbers vary according to the county and time and are affected by the number of measurements, the quality of the health care system, the options of treatment, time since the first outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender, and health overall.
At the end of 2019, WHO handed over the ICD-10 emergency cases which are U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in romance and U07.2 for deaths due to COVID-19 tested medical or physiology without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in news. The death rate according to cases reflects the death toll by the number of cases measured within a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate according to cases in the world is 6.9% (153,822/2,240.191) to 17 April 2020.
The number varies according to the county. Other measures include the death rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of discovered people who die of illness, and the death rate of infection (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected people (disclosed and undiagnosed) who die of illness.
These statistics have not been blocked by time and follow a number of people from infection to a solution to the case.
Although not all infected people get antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide an explanation of the number of people infected.
At the center of the explosion in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread in the Kanivali ceremony, and spread to young people, causing less deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths can be officially listed in that way.
Furthermore, the German health system has not failed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as was assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.0004% of the population) have been confirmed dead due to COVID-19.
The effects of this disease and its death rate are different for men and women.
In a study conducted in China and Italy, the death rate is high for men.
The main risk is for men aged 50 and older, and the gap between men and women approaching each other at only 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The real reasons for this gender diversity are unknown, but elements of nature and behavior may be the reason.
Sexually related immunity differences, the rate of women smoking is reduced and men have more than one disease such as blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher deaths for men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died because of COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not follow data related to the sex of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viruses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect different men and women.
A large percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced the terehe 11 February 2020 as the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adharmo Ghebreyesus, explained that CO represents korona, VI for viruses, D for illness and 19 is the first year the explosion was discovered: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic area (k.m. China), species of animals or groups, according to international proposals on naming the name aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the korona virus of severe asthma 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses " COVID-19 virus" and "Russian causing COVID-19" in public communication.
Disease and viruses are commonly known as "a korona virus".
During the first explosion in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly known as "the korona virus" and " Wuhan's koronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO proposed that a severe respiratory disorder of 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov as temporary names of the virus and the disease according to the 2015 anti-use guide as names of disease and viruses,
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-12 were released on February 11, 2020.
Because of the power restrictions in the regular supply chain, some digital manufacturers publish health care equipment such as nose cleaners and ventilation parts.
In one example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed an ventilation tube, and the seller was unable to communicate for a time, the domestic dealer made and published 100 tube needed for one night.
After the first COVID-19 delay, false theories, false information and lack of information emerged regarding the origin, standard, immunity, treatment and other resources of disease and rapid spread online.
Humans seem to be able to distribute viruses to other animals.
Research failed to find evidence of the virus's self-impression of pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine was confirmed to treat the disease.
International study of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being continued by government agencies, academic groups, and research.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "The UMOJA Test" to assess the impact of four available drugs fighting viruses with a strong promise of success.
No vaccine is available, but the organizations kill are developing various vaccines.
The original SARS-CoV works are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all use ACE2 receiver to enter human cells.
There are three vaccines that are being investigated.
First, researchers intend to create a vaccine for all viruses.
The use of viruses like this, whether inactive or dead, aims to increase the effects of human antibodies to new COVID-19 infections.
The second method, the vaccine section, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system feel certain components of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 event, such research is focused on S-spike protein that helps the virus incorporate the ACE2 enzyme receiver.
The third method is of a cell acid vaccine ( DNA or RNA, a new vaccine technique).
Experimental vaccines from any of these techniques will have to be tested for safety and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, the first test of the vaccine clinic began with 4 volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine has an harmless genetic code copied from the disease. The development based on antibodies has been proposed as a possible challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but is controversial.
There are over 300 clinical tests that are active from April 2020.
Seven tests were assessing proven treatment of malaria, including four hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine studies.
The modified antivirus drugs include much Chinese research, and tests of the III phase in several countries due to reports before the end of April.
A study of the development of the COVID-19 vaccine clinic continues, starting in April 2020. Several antivirus drugs are being assessed for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir/ritonavir/ritonavir/ritonavir/ritonavir with interferon beta.
There is evidence of remdesivir's efficiency, starting in March 2020.
The development of the clinic was seen for patients treated by remdesivir use.
The III phase test of clinics is conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Kloroquini, originally used to treat malaria was researched in China on February 2020, using the original results.
However, there is a call for a survey of the Americans of the study.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authority proposed the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's Virology Institute, although it recommends a daily measure of one gram, notes that using the rate twice is very dangerous and can cause death.
On March 28, 2020, FDA granted permission for emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine voluntarily of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The guidelines for the 7th edition of Chinese also include the use of interferon, interestvirin or umifonovir to prevent COVID-19.
The original data shows the high rate of interestvirin is necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in a glass container.
Izaxonide has been proposed for further volo research after showing a low-profile blockage of SARS-CoV-2. Research has shown that the increase in protein preparation using transmbrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for SARS-CpV-2 entry through contact with ACE2 receptors.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine whether or not having a biogenic cell has a significant decrease that has prevented medical professionals from embracing this treatment without further research being done. Oseltamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the production and has no role known in COVID-19 treatment.
The presence of Cytokinine protein in abundance can cause a confederation in later levels of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have a reputation for combating the excessive number of cytokini. Tocilizumab is included in the medical instructions of the Chinese national Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It passes through the 2nd phase of non-specific measurements at the national level in Italy after showing positive results for people with severe illness.
Mixed with the blood measure of ferryin's policy to identify the excessive increase in the cytokin, it is designed to deal with such results, which are considered the cause of deaths among infected people.
The counter-reference of interleukin-6 receivers was approved by FDA due to later research on treatment for over-season cytokin disease caused by different causes, CAR cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no special evidence, controlled to be tocimizumab is the best CRS treatment.
Moving the printed and active antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who recovered from COVID-19 for people who need them is being investigated as an unincorporated immune method of non-specific immune system.
This technique was tested for SARS and incomplete results.
The balance of the virus is the expected way of the action in which an unincorporated treatment of antibodies can bring protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques, such as cell-based and/or phagocytosis that are immune, are possible.
Other methods of non-specific treatment, for example, using one - made oak antibodies are developed.
The production of ahua vaccine, with a blood fluid from patients who recovered and has antibodies that are special to the virus, can increase due to rapid production.
koronavirus disease, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, daktrari at Wuhan General Hospital, who was later infected and farewell to the world due to COVID-19 after educating the public about the spread of the virus.
