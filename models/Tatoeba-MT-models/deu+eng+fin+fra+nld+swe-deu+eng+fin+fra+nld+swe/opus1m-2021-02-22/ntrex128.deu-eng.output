Members of the Wales National Assembly fear confusion with the Muppets
The proposal to amend its title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) is reluctant to some members of the National Assembly.
This is why we are planning to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament (Walish Parliament).
National Assembly members in all political directions fear to become the target of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party National Assembly said his group was concerned because the name ‘reims with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-Wales readers: In Wales, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party National Assembly said that the whole group was “unhappy” and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Walisian letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a law on the change of names, said: "The final decision on the appointments of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Wales National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which broadly supported the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the panel 'Welsh Parliament Members' (Walish Members) or 'WMPs' preferred, while the MWP option was most supported during a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but ringing for a consensus for President Elin Jones, who should present a bill within weeks, could pose a problem.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the design of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the name of the country
On Sunday the voters decide whether the name of their country should be changed to the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The referendum was called on to settle a decades of dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with a similar name of Macedonia.
For a long time Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised on the Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its admission to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silence in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people with whom I spoke said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today there is no longer both."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"The social life of people today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood in which people are regularly located."
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “be back at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with dwellings in which people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy dwellings in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community, which held its services nearby, became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support black people.
During a fire in 1939 the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who called the bell game in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had changed 18 years ago to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's in recent months is a complex story with architects and contractors, which have been attracted in part by the lay leaders of the Church and in part by the bishop's diocese.
In July, the municipal board – the municipal board consisting of Laien leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to transfer the costs to the municipal board, although the diocese had not been involved in the assignment of the diocese's commissioned architects and contractors.
Some community members complained about lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Shark wounded in California 13-year-olds when diving after lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark, according to official statements, attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for praise.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends in the Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's help screaming and paddling with several others to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was happy to catch a lobster. But then he realized that the boy screamed “I was bite!
I've been bite!".
When Hammel arrived with the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been cut up.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’”, added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical condition.
The type of hay responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials for investigation purposes and for security reasons locked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attackes boats, superdrugs and Debenhams with cosmetic departments that are in charge of shopping houses.
As part of a major advance on the 2.8 billion UK pounds of cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetic departments will be tested in eleven branches across the country. If they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search for the supermarkets for possibilities to use previously used laden spaces for television, microwave and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetic offer for the first time doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boots.
The supermarket also runs a relaunch of its make-up series “Butique” so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test at two Sainsbury's Filial Sales Centres. Last week the first sale site was opened in Croydon, south of London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local demand goods shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to make customers visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales sites will increasingly look like shops, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food products.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos sales offices and a number of Habitat sales sites, which has increased food sales and profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after a discussion about the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches into the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches of pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as an extended range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic shopping that questions the current type of shopping."
Peter Jones 'rageous' after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million UK pounds
"Dragons 'The' star Peter Jones is 'rageous' after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million UK pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company in order to focus on their own new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been "raged" when the "golden girl" of the television at an exciting meeting on Tuesday in the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that, due to its new business – worth up to 1.5 million UK pounds – Truly could no longer devote enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million UK pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure their future over the next decades in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw was absolutely surprising for all interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the market launch.
A warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold in Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the 'This Morning' moderator, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost millions of companies due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market introduction.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is expected to be brand messenger for M&S and to replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV broadcast.
A close source of Jones said last night: "We are not commenting on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he expected from the media for a comment, which some would consider as 'non-presidential', and for such positive statements on the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news moderator:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump in June as a major step towards denuklearisation of North Korea.
However, the denuklearisation negotiations have been in the process.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the highest North Korean diplomat, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North would not see a 'corresponding' reaction from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States held sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump showed himself much more optimistic in his speech of inauguration.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the deadly remains of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to enter this overcrowded arena, there would be about 200 people here," said Trump, showing the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
For example, after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were said that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was expelled, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
"Sorry, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not request international support, so that's a little difficult," sneezing said.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu in order to see whether international agencies should be involved in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes with which Indonesia is constantly fighting, the country is still sadly poorly prepared for natural violence.
While Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a daily view on other coastlines.
The apparently missing tsunami warning rines in Palu, despite a warning in force, have probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is a challenge already in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A lazarett ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the attacked Indonesian infrastructure a key part of his election campaign and has spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko who seeks to re-election next year suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by continuing religious tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes and homes when bands from Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with macs, arrows and arches and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep balancing against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1-back of his team at about 27 metres from Chelsea gate.
He targeted the ball to the left and then shot him in the direction of the rear path.
The shooting sailed high over the penal area and drove into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I have just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I have simply tried to create as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edges coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and simply accepted the shot."
Chelsea led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard to the mid-term after a hit in the 25th minute with 1:0.
The Blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpooler half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so danger came into the prison space.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed with a left shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker back into the network.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea stands against the UEFA Europa League videoton in London on Thursday at 3:00 p.m.
Number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to be trapped in the dams of buildings that had been crashed by the earthquake of the strength 7.5 from Friday, which had triggered up to six meters high waves, said the official speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was flooded with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested man, 32, for murder suspected after a woman was beaten
After finding a women's leak this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspected.
The police ask the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I would ask everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and had seen or heard something suspect.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers who may have taken up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe the woman to know arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police informed that she was about to inform the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The inhabitants are now informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeatedly, 'this is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the locking and another vehicle before the locking.
Within the lockdown, several police officers were in charge of the residential block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or refer anonymously to Crime Stopers under 0800 555 111 and refer to Protocol 247 dated 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament will be the most recent monument of the dispute about the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by his fanatic puritan followers, reminding the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as 'dartness' and 'an attempt to redefine history'.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's statue was the target of the Westminster Palace.
The image storm in the English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history written by a figure that is still worth being celebrated.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today as someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case, of course by monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly correct presentation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single identifiable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China.
The man named "Yuan" was found dead with a separated artery near a pig stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer made himself ready to inject pig vaccines in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a neighboring pig stable.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on the throat.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had bite the farmers dead.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin called "Wu" was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was trapped in order to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts. He suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilos of heavy pigs swept in a Welsh farmer between themselves and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to crush the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012 in Oregon, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a " trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like to twist and are very curious, ... they're not about to hurt someone.
You just have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread strong rain in the southwest of the United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way through the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rainfall in North Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock East Coast Time, pink wind speeds were 136 km/h, which corresponds to a category 1 hurricane, and were 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trog begins to form over the Pacific, moving east to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity will be transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday up to 25 centimeters.
The tropical moisture will then produce strong rainfall in the southwest in the coming days through interactions with the appealing trog.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flutary floods, water-driven scraps and possibly ground slides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, precipitation is expected to be up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the dispersion of tropical precipitation there is the possibility of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgently advised not to walk into the desert.
Strong precipitation can cause canyons to become decaying streams, and storms bring local winds as well as winds that lead to dust.
The nearest trog brings locally strong rain in parts of the coast of South California.
Total precipitation volumes of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to a low degree of water-driven shock and smooth pathways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first individual tropical rain viewers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads to the Four Corners region and lasts on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the United States, a warm early October with widespread temperatures of 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is approximately 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of over-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million viewers saw the fascinating statements of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patt situation stopped. On Friday, the television stations interrupted their regular program for a last minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, so that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, forced her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average audience numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this into the right perspective: this corresponds to about the number of viewers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, the broadcaster Fox News Channel, whose thinking-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million audiences.
ABC came second with 3,26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesters in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Judicial Committee strongly urged him to speak.
He stood for minutes with a lower view while he was smolten. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
'I'm standing right in front of you,' said a woman.
"Do you believe he will tell the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said a woman.
Flake said that his office had published a statement and supplemented it before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say to the Committee during the hearing.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later, when the Justice Committee was to vote on the transfer of the nomination of Kavanaughs to the entire Senate for a vote.
Flake, however, said that he would do this only on the condition that the FBI, as requested by the democratic minority, investigates the accusations against the candidate next week.
Flake was partially persuaded by talks with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance since it was obvious that without the investigation the Republicans would not have enough votes for the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
President Trump induced an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics to use Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for departure from the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May meets on September 29, 2018 for the Party Day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal for the reciprocal imposing of customs duties by the UK and the EU "globally absurd".
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police detects suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
In connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), a suspect was arrested.
According to the Baton Rouge police, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for murder.
The Authority published video recordings of the dispute between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had committed the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit was set at US$350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shooting wound on the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Criminal Technical Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the Regional Executive Authority for "her care and her pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father also played Wayne for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU said that Will Wade said that the team was "thought" over Wayde's death and "be under shock".
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wade said.
Volcano spies ashes on Mexico City.
Ashes thrown out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of frogs and shocks.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have found increased activity on the 72 km southeast of the capital volcano since a starch earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico was shocked in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence
In Barcelona, six persons were arrested on Saturday after collisions between the preparedness police and Pro-Independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to recall the first anniversary of the Polishing Independence Referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the preparedness police, threw them with eggs and also slew colour powder, so that dark dust clouds emerged in the streets usually populated with tourists.
In the next day, there were also crowds of hands with the police, who used their strikes to curb the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups "no forget, no forgiveness" scandalized, while Unionists confronted them with "Long Living Spain".
According to the local press, fourteen persons were treated for smaller injuries.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tensioned.
The voters had opted for independence with an overwhelming majority, although the participation in the elections was low, as the opponents of the division largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 persons were injured last year when the police tried to prevent voting in violent collisions in front of the electoral venues.
Pro-independence groups had fought outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electricist who participated in the protest of the separatists with his wife, said that he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer hopefully.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy because they were able to choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, although scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties in maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their best-known leaders are either in their own exile or in detention, waiting for their procedures for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favour of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been driven by politicians on both sides.
'The situation is becoming increasingly tense,' he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election to the European Parliament next year.
'As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to defend the decline in democratic values and the oppression of the Spanish government', he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the house had been picked up by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, the car may have been shot with a chest.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The risen Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved to be crucial to Gary Holt's team in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team stays in the Premiership with no outward victory in this season and is facing the Hearts next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime Livingston can increase his win series in the division to six games, i.e. Chief coach Holt has not seen any defeat since he took over Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead for a long time before the hit, since his directness put the Rangers in front of the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but became slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he was hereinged to hit Craig Halkett's head shot by the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play before themselves, as they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the crucial gate came to pass.
The Rangers allowed a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Menga in shooting position at Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the criminal room.
In this phase the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the host's defense, and gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unclear.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers Gatekeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow sled the ball from another standard situation in Livingston.
Flankes returned to Livingston's penal area and were regularly removed from the danger area, while two required penalties were refused – one by Halkett against the changed Glenn Middleton and one for handplay.
"Phänomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have exceeded expectations again in this upward trend.
Their play mode and team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt pays great praise for the way he has been awakening the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on Trab throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they were occasionally under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the host team – and that is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue sky prevailed when the government heads of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair the relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for keeping a large number of 25 000 people from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also heard. They condemned Erdogan's policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised as a hero by some German Turks and scourged by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in London in a collision with a car.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and medical officers took care of the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident with driver escape in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident on Saturday.
According to Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next relatives.
Road locks and redirections for buses are set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in the event of unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The unrests broke out at approximately 9:30 British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday and stopped.
Specialised 'Tornado' officials were added to end the unrests involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The officials were treated on site for minor injuries in the face.
A prison service spokesman said: “There was a specially trained prison staff in order to remedy a persistent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that police officials will be handed over and possibly spend longer behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison leader was reported to have been treated by a prison prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, officers were called into prison to deal with serious unrests in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen early next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move over the southwest of the desert and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flooding on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service informed in a Tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane within 64 kilometres from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with individual up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and individually up to 10 centimeters are possible.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink may be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, there is at least extreme drought in slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico on land.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will travel north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thereby weaken itself.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will meet in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The precipitation may be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, precipitation amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible," said weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will move as a tropical storm northward over Mexico, reach the border with Arizona in the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression and then move up to the late Tuesday evening through Arizona in the south of Utah.
"As a major danger, very strong precipitation is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the southwest of the United States, which is characterized by deserts," the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening flutary floods are expected in the desert and water-driven spoil as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
After finding a 16-year-old with spark wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to a hospital, and his condition is "stability".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Officials asked all those who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered 'under the community, the anger' of the Democrats.
"A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the scrupulous and unhearnable tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered the democrats 'under the community, the anger' during the whole process of nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh declared before the Congress and rejected the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually insulted them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also made a statement on her accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brightness, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote in favour of the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favour of the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in service for the general public," he said to the number of his followers in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the mid-elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not joining, but in reality I'm joining," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission to 'resistance and blocking'.
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high GOP leader in CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, numbers of victims rising
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swept off when, due to a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, gigantic waves were struck on the beaches.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu, when when darkness broke up to six meters high waves hit the beach and many people broke to death and destroyed everything they were in their way.
The tsunami had been preceded by an earthquake of strength 7.5.
"When yesterday the threat from the tsunami came, people still went on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he swimd cars, tree stems and houses, he met everything on land," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had been pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he came to the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees on their escape from the tsunami, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centres in Palu.
Air recordings published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by further afterbearings.
The earthquake series was known in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in the massive earthquake of Friday corresponded to the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have become bigger, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "completing" and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
According to his reports, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of crashed buildings. 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala was, according to Nugrohos, completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a statement of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,' said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not having informed that a tsunami Palu had hit, although the waves were reported to have arrived at the time of the warning.
Amateur images published in social media show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the road under him from the near tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall pushes on the shore and swims buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
As a result of the earthquake and the tsunami, there was a massive power failure that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuates still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and was only reopened for relief.
A visit of President Joko Widodo to evacuation centres in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have securely reached the city of Palu, in which the employees are located in tent accommodations in the inner courtyard of their office, but according to Dosebas, they passed the scenes of destruction on their way.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups started the hard task of launching disaster aid, some showed that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are not possible until the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status is not valid until now.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for them on one of the miracles that reveal the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewage channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces released a woman who had been stuck in the body of her mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia at the end of Asia games.
Others of the Roa-Roa hotel were prisoners, as Mandagi supplemented, his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told me how he had sent whatsapp messages to the competition participants from Palu who participated in the beach festival in the hours after the Roa-Roa hotel crashed among the paragliders.
His messages, however, led to grey question marks instead of blue cocks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been sent," he said.
Thefts steal 26.750 US dollars while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from Newport Police, the Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Dieve stole a staff member of Brink’s in filling a cash machine $26.750.
The driver of the vehicle had emptyed a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to spend more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man ran behind the staff of Brink's" and stole a bag full of money for the machine.
According to the press release, several suspects were seen fleeing from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The official being known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has used the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where his new album "Yandhi" is expected to be published.
He is a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has cancelled for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not only a shortening of its current professional name, but, according to its own statement, it has a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with Radiomoderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only ‘ye’ became a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects more what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West previously worked, has already written his name with and without strings and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never apply military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that " never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On 2 October 1968 soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square and killed 300 people. At that time left-handed student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
Given China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the IK announcements in various areas of the US government, although the USA generally lacks a formal IK strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of IK innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the USA. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next major IK results would be achieved in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent KIC companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at an AI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello players. Later he was leading at Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated earlier US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the date of the next competition, since he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee's words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive state subsidies.
"Not China takes away the leading academic forces, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited coryphes from universities to work at KI.
In Lee's view, a change in US immigration policy could also contribute to US IK efforts.
"I think that in the field of IK, PhD people should automatically be offered greencards," he said.
In July 2017, China's Council of State presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations awarded funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which a partner from industry and science should be involved. In addition, the White House announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of USD 2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, nothing has been done in US laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the name of the country
The people of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would resolve a decade old dispute with Greece which had blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises claim on the Greek territory, and therefore Greece has put in place a veto against the admission of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign doubts that the participation in the elections will reach the 50% required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, among which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the prize for inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The change in name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, election participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters had voted.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko gave their vote in Strumica, Macedonia, in the referendum on the change of the country's name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised main, not through the back entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of it, since more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian telma TV found that 57 per cent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour of 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the election participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow for the policy of the pro-western government since it took power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton defense to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling surpassed the Brighton Defense on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green tricots.
He played around a defender and then overcame several other defenders at the edge of the Brighton Penal Room.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the criminal room to play the ball back to Aguero, which with his right shoe Brighton gatekeeper Mathew Ryan covered and shot into the right side of the network.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about that he should play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he reached a gate at this moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League Duell.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before he jumped out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the rockies' game
Since the nationals were removed from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force further efforts.
However, the always powerful Scherzer hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies who in the NL West have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for which playoffs are relevant.
The rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can throw at least because we know the atmosphere among the audiences here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why shouldn't I want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but according to reports, they are inclined to throw scissors in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this was the 34th set as a starter, exercised in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
This season, Washington's right-wing hammer has a statistic of 18-7, showing an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds attendance in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh, which he chose for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the mid-elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks ago, one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big, big – I do not enter, but in reality I enter, that's why I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take over the power again by all means, you see the community, the disgusting.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, see their mission to 'resistance and blocking'.
'And you see this in the last four days', he said and referred to the Democrats as 'rageous and cruel and disgusting and dishonest'.
He named the highest-ranking democracy in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered noise in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document come out?
Uh, uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for you - that was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer allows all opinions to be applied.
The party is intolerable to those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted for me to blame, this was not surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticised by the motion for a pity for representing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically about similar issues, which Jeremy and former top politicians did not agree.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that 'the meetings should be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly the same.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not characterised by this sound, and the promised 'friendly, more cautious' policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is assessed as to whether it is accepted by the party's tip.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party. Collegaes who I previously believed in sharing similar political views now expected me to make a turning point and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was about national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – there is a shy ride in the social media, calling for my election, accusing the political center and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not here alone.
In fact, I know that I am feeling better than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of colleagues who are facing a daily flood of sexist or racist afflictions and who, however, never give little attention.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that scams have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn insisted last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we do not allow all opinions to be applied, and with any motion of censure and any change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more engaging.
In the past two years, I have often been advised to draw my head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have 'no problems'.
But I didn't go to politics for that.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally collapsed in the whole school, I have joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most urgently – as a council council as well as as as a Cabinet Minister.
I never made a hail from my political views, even not at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday's request: given that the country is going to have a brexit, which will harm the households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not send this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many threats of election or political purpose will not prevent me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unschlaged Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unschlaged at the top of the table.
At last, the success of the home team was due to its superior defense as well as to their better opportunities utilisation, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far, and we are still unschlaged, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Acknowledgment for Ayr, they have exploited their opportunities better than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, on the basis of a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose could let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught an unintended attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a sentence before he reached a hit directly at the mid-time and then achieved an increased attempt in sole entrance, so it stood for Ayr to break 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second half-time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the field of play. After the continuation, Ayr built his advances by an attempt by Stafford McDowall, increased by Climo.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as Captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again at the end of a phase Melrose made huge pressure pay the additional man by an unintended attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained a touchdown from the Penal Station behind the predecessor Ayr package.
Climo increased, as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's box kick and the flanker Gregor Henry had sent off for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in the gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be willing to switch to the hospitality after it turned out that he was called Managing Director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan's interest in entering Glasgow's "flooring restaurant business".
"The Sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is included in the country, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Matroses are patroling in front of the Marine headquarters decorated with dive work in La Paz.
There is a sea blue flag on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Titicacasee to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovering it is a duty."
The memory of the coastline lost in Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still as alive as the desire to drive over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and expects the result, of course, with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will pursue the IGH's judgment on large screens in the hope that the Hague Court will decide on Bolivia's claim, which states that Chile is obliged, after decades of sporadic talks, to negotiate a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who will be facing a controversial fight for his reelection next year, a lot is also at stake in the ruling on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would not change any more.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not empowered to agree to Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the fact that the judgment of the Court of Justice was held six months after the final plea, suggests that the case was not ‘incomplex’.
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also be a backlog.
"The current Bolivian government has broken the issue of access to the sea itself," said Zárate.
She indicated that Morales' warrior rhetoric has suffocated Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their discussions, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an exceptional opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "solve the 139 years of disputes to mutual advantage," he said.
Calzadilla also contests that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political hub.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgement is an opportunity to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never scratch its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the Heads of State of the Rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be about to relaunch the fortified nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean Head Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration of the end of the Korean war would ever force the North into the knees, as ‘spinned’.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement without Pyongjang taking important disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pjöngjang is serious about the absence of an arsenal in which the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongjang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hut collection or completely protect the sun, you don't need to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy over-size head coverings for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely unpractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations over the course.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a spring-like wide edge that just pushed the heads of the models.
Other overdimensional accessories were shown with jewels occupied watermelons, a magical hat and even ananas. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with sewed lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skin couture.
One creation resembled a dive equipment, including snorkel and dive glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you have luck.
Mode observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly on to 'La Bomba', the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide edge, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat, which struck large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the path: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as large as the model wearing a bath suit that kept the bag.
The bastash in red orange with bast french and a white leather hench at the Paris fashion week was the highlighting piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera".
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has so much attention that the demand for superdimensional accessories will hardly be ignorable."
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens essential
Schottland's independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to maintain their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for training and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design a tailor-made curriculum and actually implement it, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as choices in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current examination results this year show that languages with the highest levels of existence are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who learned foreign languages obtained Note A in higher examinations.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A in higher examinations, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also obtained Note A.
This illustrates the fact that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are today considered as selective subjects as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 per cent of the reasons for employers’ problems with the occupation of open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
Since more and more open jobs require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically provide an advance before competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken only by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today's children that we invest in language education now.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find a useful job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, for example, mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, independent schools will always have a number of languages with specialist teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and provides them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication capacity'."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting will soon end.
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in the opening game on Sunday.
However, the number of minutes he will play is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked for training for his plans for the six games of the Lakers' full pre-season playtable.
"I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's attendance in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaigns.
This is the first events planned by Trump for the next week, including well-meaned places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancies at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress.
When will Trump's event take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's attendance in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's attendance in West Virginia below as live stream at YouTube online.
Trump is likely to respond to the hearings of the board Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court, to accusations of sexual misconduct that have been carried out this week in an enthusiastic atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in the sweats up to one week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of talks is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult election in November.
That is why President Trump's campaign team against Reuters stated that these five events will serve to "mobilize volunteers and followers, while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is so important for his plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible, while the operational campaign season is nearing," said a Trump campaign speaker, who did not want to call his name, to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh" could participate in the event scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state that he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the former Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to push him into the surveys," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the United States shows battle willingness to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts could have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum as a sports concept is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So where do they think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now it's four, so I think this means a small moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when he left the playground.
Europe, of course, is in favour and is four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can present three of four points each.
Spieth was awkwardly strong from the drop to the green and proceeds with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams were louder in the course of his round, when he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both for himself, after he and Thomas had left after two holes with two points.
His pussy, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that remains to the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have only scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days and thus certainly wrote the Ryder Cup history.
Europe's unlike, but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and apparently between them and the amount of flowing energy left behind underlines that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who will defeat a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
One Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Swedish into a clamp that they could not overcome near.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
The four and four pairs are to be viewed as fascinating from the proximity due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or not, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team until now and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this four-year round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe lies in front of the United States after the four and four parties of Saturday with 10:6 and goes with a solid advance in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The genius playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the troubled Tiger Woods and could thus book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to regain the trophies lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the four the morning against the defective American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but could not recover the residue.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend, won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After they beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they harmonize excellently and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5&4.
Woods, who had slept through two matches on Saturday, occasionally blossomed his blossom, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four parties and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the 4th morning, returned and played the 4th parties as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris did not go all according to its ideas.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the brass for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the four, they achieved a tough 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-parts 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after it had gone to the individual with a residue of four points. However, as a title holder, Furyk's team is indeterminate enough to keep the trophies.
After they've only been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects one-sided disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their mistrust of the United States and, under these circumstances, not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken 'essential measures by goodwill' last year, for example, stopping nuclear and rocket tests, decreasing the nuclear testing site and committing itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see any corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances we will not at all end up one-sided first."
While Ri relied on North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phase-oriented' approach to deuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral deuclearisation from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a President of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim had assured to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump gave guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks an official end to the Korean war, which was conducted between 1950 and 1953, while the United States said that Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington is opposed to demands for a relief of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
'The United States insists on 'first denuklearisation' and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by compulsively, and are even opposed to 'the declaration of the end of the war', said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain spinning of people who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had emphasized at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party in the question of denulceration, then the denulceration of the Korean peninsula would not have been this stop."
However, the sound of Ris' speech was enormously different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States after "the evil president" called Trump Kim "Raketenmann" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who was threatened by the 'whelming destruction' of North Korea last year, has accustomed Kim to the United Nations with praise for his courage in terms of disarmament steps, but he said that there is still much work to be done and the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's de-uklearization.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timeframe for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongjang for the steps taken.
However, on Thursday, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: 'The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued vigorously until we have achieved complete, definitive and verified denuklearisation.'
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to drie Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes financially.
Pompeo met Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made only to be accused by North Korea hours later of having ‘games-like’ claims.
North Korea promised this month, at a meeting with Moon, to dismantle a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took 'comparative measures'.
He said that Kim told him that the 'corresponding measures' sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students in basic studies get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture to stay awake with caffeine and learn all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessarily needed when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after having held a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I learn it only now, in my last year?’
According to their words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained to students how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrics at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after she had found that students were under severe sleep withdrawal during the week.
The one hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the image of a room in a living room and click on coffee bags, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleeping deficiency on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university site with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the smoking decision affects your health," said Professor Czeisler.
He said and added that modern technologies and the growing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
He said that the "secret weapon" should be sufficient to ensure good sleep for all students against stress, exhaustion and fears. Furthermore, a weight gain could be avoided, as sleep withdrawal puts the brain in hunger mode, so they were constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. Last year, he had completed one of his courses in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should set up a wake-up for the sleeping time and the awakening time, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emanates from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the circular rhythm out of the pace, leading to problems in sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor enforces Gerrards players
The Rangers lost another outward game when the hit by Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unanimity team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book its first outward victory at St. Johnstone since the 4:1 triumph, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the leading Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the poor inspiring Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and lies only behind the Tord-Difference in Hibernian.
The Rangers are also at risk of further trouble after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a headache by an object that apparently was thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which Ayr vanished and reached the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point from the Hearts last week, and had to be enthusiastic about how his well trained team kept their opponents under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
You should have reached a gate after only two minutes when Mengas first shot Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot by the back.
The Rangers took over the control, but their game seemed rather hopeful in the last third rather than convincing.
Alfredo Morelos apparently felt that after a quarter of an hour he should have received an offence due to a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian.
In the first half of the season, the Rangers have only two hits, but the former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly had hardly any trouble with Lassana Coubaly's headball and a shaky shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits in the 34th minute may not match the course of the game, it is not denyable that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple graduation.
Gerrard acted in the mid-term and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the wing player put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that lies with them, with Lithgow and Halkett having a long ball after each other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor kept good and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers Exchange Player Glenn Middleton also late called for a offense after a crowd of Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geigerzähler
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geigerzähler.
The Geigerzähler, which has since become a standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this all over the world?"
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Really, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' detarized cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and destroy decayed cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to identify debarted cells during treatment.
The method takes immune cells from a patient that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can see a large number of cancer types of common protein and then be re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarial cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect detarted cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes immune cells from a patient that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancers of common HER2 protein. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, egg, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a Pro-Trump-Tirade and wore a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was cast out in the studio at Saturday Night Live after he had praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to become president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a make-america-great-against cap, he continued with a sparkling canonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I am so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He's a racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Justice Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the record of West's Schimpftirade was not sent, she was uploaded to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head cover.
"They've sniffed me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap. ’
You screwed me up!
And then they say I'm in a sinking area," he said to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunk area?" He said he would "wear my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments triggered calls from the audience at least twice, and SNL participants were embarrassingly touched, reports Variety. One person said to the magazine: "It was deadly in the studio."
West had late been obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture of the title "I Love it", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group. She tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, WHEN YOU TAKE THE MASH HAST."
However, talk show moderator Karen Hunter twittered that West was simply he himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, has a detrimental ideology for my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us.", she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and now was "The being formally known as Kanye West" (the officially known being Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg wore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then into "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (The formerly known artist as Prince).

"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington attackes toxic males
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the Machoheld. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often having to feel strong to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed something was wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also involved in "Game of Thrones", also 31, admitted that the solution to the problem was 'very important' to him.
"I personally find the question at the moment very important what has happened wrong with males," he said.
'What have we taught growing men about the problem that we are now seeing?'
Harington believes that, due to the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic maskulinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embodie this particular side of a man?
I think that is really one of the great questions of our time: how do we change this?
For there is clearly something wrong with the young men."
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series in the next summer he will not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones".
From November, Harington will be seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that for him the best was at "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this mission, so I have received my future family and life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow, with numerous Emmys.
Both married Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Contrary to the past, the transmission was done in the vast majority of the new cases through sexual intercourse.
To date, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who had been infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT members is expected to be widespread.
Based on the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men finally marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection of sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees have sent through the data of the GOP Senators, criticises "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, contested claims on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MEPs.
The democrats from Los Angeles felt that the claims of "ultra-legal" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"Liars, lies and even more disgusting lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The published information should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual errors raised against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three Senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of contributions was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for transmitting this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation prompted online criticism, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementia is angry," said Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You must not be defying.
You may not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be quiet and left."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having been angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joined the mid-term elections to redeem Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing if it's true," he twittered.
Waters stated in her statement that her office informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are brought to account for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous for all my staff."
Criticism for "Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-coloured film. This also seems to be true for this revival of the "Johnny English" action parodie franc, which started in 2003 with "Johnny English – The spy who scooped it" and resurrectly revived in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now quite".
Will an ironic self-parodie about how obvious we are to be torn into a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, slicing and incompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time to masturbate. His name signals more than anything else that he is a general funny creation for cinema visitors in the non-English room.
Of course, he is again the foolish secret agent who bizarrely thinks he's cool and world-manish, while in reality he's made up of some Clouseau, a Prise Mr. Bean and a cricket of this guy who contributed a single note to the title melody of "The hour of the winner" at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos left behind travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising spots.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves shortly stuck on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is emerging, but humor seems rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially because the 'serious' film series such as '007' and 'Mission Impossible' are now offering self-safe comodant elements.
The humor seems to target children more than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy discomfort is not as inventive and focussed as Atkinson's stumm film gags in the role of the bean.
The ever-current premiss is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents in operation, very much to the misfortune of the servant, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last throat for the Prime Minister, an inflamed and pressurised figure that is already facing the complete collapse due to its political in popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give much to work with.
Their intelligence consultants inform them that all active spies have been dismantled and therefore they have to take someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolpatish Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a well-functioning institution, but has inofficial teaching in working as a undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy that reminds of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall to an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always do everything terriblely wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are again in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously in the banner of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of the UK.
English and Bough begin their Odyssee of great spits: As a waitress, they dress up a chic French restaurant in fire, they make chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, although all the registers are drawn, however sympathic and funny it is, the subject is already discussed in detail in the children's television.
It's fairly moderate.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson play a role that really suits his talent?"
Labour denies working on a plan after which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan that provides that the British are working four days a week but are paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off to employees.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to the sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers is appropriate.
The transition to a four-day week was supported by the Trade Union Congress (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A directive review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'A change will not take place overnight, but a working week of four days is a desire that is in line with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance for workers and with the party's general industrial policy strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised during the 2017 general election campaign the introduction of a 4-day week.
However, the Labour Party is currently not in favour of the approach as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A 4-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell conceived his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of ‘anonymous directors’ and ‘profitmakers’ in public supply companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not recover their entire share, as a labour government could take 'reductions' due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees in the boards of companies and establish an inclusive ownership fund to hand over 10% of private companies' equity to employees who collect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion in the case of Kavanaugh
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court judge by at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could affect Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring about something, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I announced in the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be stoned.
"My opinion is firm with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to run a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett has vehement contested this," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called it could not confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was helped to reduce poverty during this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, to fight the world's poverty every year with an impressive lineup of stars and an impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival this year for the 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project. Within the framework of this project, an international group of stakeholders is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to carry out a number of tasks, including actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen will remain for 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of setting up a cool free concert, a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called Clicktivism – if you think to change something by signing an online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has had more than 19 million actions from its supporters and has achieved different objectives.
These actions should have contributed to encouraging leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least US$10 billion has already been paid out or received through fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, the secured funds have to date direct effects on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars to combat under-feeding in the country after they have received more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions that urged the United Kingdom to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “It will be a long and energetic path with heights and depths.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are one of the artists who are present at this year's event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy for blocking purposes to obstruct Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, if necessary, Washington can use the Navy so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East,” said Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
'I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in the field of energy, just as in Eastern Europe,' he said.
And according to the official, there are means and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, together with the Navy, ensure that the seaways remain open and block them if necessary in order to ensure that Russia's energy does not reach the market," he informed.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance events, a non-profit group, which understood itself to be the 'vote of electricity consumers' in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he called Russia 'One Trick Pony' with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was expanding the exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'inappropriate' Pipeline Project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became Moscow's 'captured'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline worth 11 billion US dollars, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exercising pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stand out from the EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," the BDI Dieter Kempf Executive Board commented after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a presidential candidate in 2020 “exactly review,” says Senator for Massachusetts
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "investigate" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considered a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren intends to examine a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump was driving this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump handles our democracy," she said.
Warren did not take a sheet in front of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should be candidates for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe survey, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be candidate.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidateship.
The survey showed more support for a candidate for former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who support a potential candidate, and 48 percent who are against.
The other names of prominent Democrats, which are eligible for a possible candidateship in 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator von Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make official decisions by January.
Sarah Palin expresses himself on the Donald Trump-Ralley on the post-traumatic stress disorder, under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son suffers from, what he's going through when he comes back, that's all that can imitate other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an elephant in the room and said about her son and other war veterans that they would come back, that they would come back, that they would come back and wonder if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a speaker of the Wasilla police department.
18 states and D.C. support an appeal to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new US policy, which refuses to provide asylum to victims of band activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seekers who questioned politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace vs. session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not announced.
She informed that her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but US officials refused their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where very many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations who face major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on their escape from domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "the decade of legislation at the state, federal and international level" ignored.
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court violates this principle," the Court's statement stated.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse to enter the country would have an adverse impact on the US economy, since immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour.
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
"Asyl is available for all who leave their country of origin because they are being persecuted or because of fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political belief," said sessions in his announcement of 11 June.
It was never the plan to remove all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face every day in the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little fevering son in a rescue centre in the destroyed city centre of Palu.
“Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to collect their fullest possessions and wealth, mounting everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who became vertebrates and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continuing strong afterbearings.
With tears in his eyes, he told me how the violent earthquake shocked the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"Everything went far too fast.
I think I was stuck under the walls," he reported to Associated Press, and added that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s call, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US ambassadors accuses China of Tyrannei with 'propaganda advertisements'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had posted a four-page announcement in an American newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China were announced, the US ambassador in China accused the capital city of Beijing of using the American press for Progaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he had accused China of intervening in the US Congress Elections on November 6, a charge that denies China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections correspond to the US officials' communication to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exercise pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an ending trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Republican party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exported agricultural products to China to a large extent, informed that Beijing's workers, farm owners and businesses were injured.
China, according to Branstad in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyrannie by switching propaganda ads in the US's own free press.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the proven tradition of freedom of expression and independent press in America by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will only find in a limited number of votes against the newspaper skioskens here in Beijing and do not find any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese might have on the worrying economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republicans conceal voters from the mid-elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans are supporting and defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming mid-elections, especially women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they will continue with a vote.
"There is no way to revoke such things," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute advance was sufficient for an FBI investigation to make angered voters calm.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the first adviser and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn Group, on Friday, so the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the corridor of the Senate called "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the Committee on Justice, decided to hold on to the nomination of Kavanaughs and reported that despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“The people say it is already high, that is true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which their accusations of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, Director at Priorities USA, a group supporting the election of Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to disagree with whom they should believe due to the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitively or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38 % indicated that they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his statement, while 30 % indicated the same about Ford.
According to Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least one other claimant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an oath statement last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had blurred his genitals against her when they were at a party during their study in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruptt, is a company based on the Open-Source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee bestowed that the intention behind inrupt was the "world domination".
"We have to become active now," he said on the issue of startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It can contain contact lists, tasks lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all contents are available in a browser and at the same time.
The particular thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea that the company will use resources, processes and appropriate skills to ensure that Solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers. A security platform acquired by IBM is also being used.
From the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee informed that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, which will completely redesign their entire business models overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a post on a medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months Berners-Lee has been significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Viktoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his engagement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British War Award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroct for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann conducted his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin, through dense fog and heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he moved to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest braveness" before he preeded with a field weapon in the sole entrance and turned out three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the acts of his grandfather were something that he could never be justified, and at the same time something that would make one humiliate.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a crane under the lead of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the courage of a true hero would be visible mainly through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their fight, the audiences in the United Kingdom were not badly surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained unaffected after staying awake until early morning hours to see the fight specifically.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the trick film figure as a kind of bad joke.
"On the basis of a government regulation, these contents are classified as non-adolescent, so that at 6 o'clock they had to be switched to a children's show," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in Marketing and Communication at Bellator, when he was interviewed about the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Board of Directors at Bellator, Scott Coker, informed that the company will process the run-up plan to take account of audiences from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that the problem could be solved in the replay game already," he said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday with the spectators in the United Kingdom, and we’re not going to solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday’s local time there.
But we'll stay there.
When the change was made, it was pretty messed up and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have assumed it to be a technical disruption.
What was not the case was a problem from the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as normally, and we have tried to offer the fans the best experience.
The whole situation is rather regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "subordinate" in the theme of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympics as a water jumper, says he's grown up with the feeling of being subdued to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne he said he spoke about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the wins in the Olympic Games are no longer so important for him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease for a few months.
In the first show of Laverne he said that he previously considered himself to be inferior compared to others, since love for boys and girls was completely unacceptable socially.
He said: "Today, the feeling of being subdued and different from the others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games today is a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had made a statement on this subject because, fortunately, he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to give courage to others.
The three-fold world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the difference in age was never a topic.
He thinks that when you were a child and a young person, he took part in the Olympic Games for the first 14 years and his father died three years later of cancer, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has a son who wears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, everything would have turned around gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the nearest death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be there very early.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that I finally realized that he is not invincible," he continued.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at Olympic Games – that was crazy,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song before the Olympic Games and still cared for goose skin.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bench
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that it doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the centre of the event as usual, the five-fold major winner spent his day with fireing others and working on his game, in the hope of resolving the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the directest golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misleading balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself was not discouraging enough, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, a new one at these tournaments to win every four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start with four points back in the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to him.
"He was perfectly aware of his role today, gave me a knock on the back and laid his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was on two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went, and that's what we were expecting.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games performed on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway that never fully matched the peaks of his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 victorys, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to do a few bits, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it may soon be over with the jump
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advance that leads to the last single games at the Ryder Cup can quickly become a displeasant situation.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advance against the Americans, but only just came over the target line and went in the lead with the smallest possible advance and gained a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
"The idea remains that we had a great advance in Valderrama, we had a great advance in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but it's just a little bit," said Bjørn (imaged on the photo), after he had seen the victory 5-3 of the 2018 class both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
It's going to be right tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is not over until the points are on the tab.
We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what is facing us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy for the performance of his players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overthrow this.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual services are at the forefront and that is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're out there alone, you're tested as a golfer up to the limits of your skills.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut out better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turnout on the last day of the tournament. He stood on the winner side in Brookline before he stood on the losers side after Europe's "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to withdraw the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medina.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of resolving the battle, he has to join the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as another European in the top half of the ranking.
"I decided for the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest Fregatte of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace warships coming into the years from the time of the Cold War. However, according to local media, it is only delivered early next year due to defective systems and fast-growing costs.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Palatinate', the pilot ship of the brand new Fregats of the 'Baden-Württemberg' class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time called for a military speaker.
The ship should have been put in service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Fregats of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to include a powerful canon, a series of air defence missiles and sea target aircraft as well as tarn technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest Fregats do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can lead to the outdated state-of-the-art warships that Germany is supposed to represent as a sea force at the time of their commissioning, according to The Time.
The Fregatte F125, followed by the accident, entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after it had been delivered.
There was little knowledge about the reasons for return, but German media called a number of major "software and hardware errors" which would have made the new ship unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 matros, only half as many as on the older Bremen class fregats.
It was also known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to a loss of performance and prevents the marine from performing upgrading measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes heavy 'Rheinland-Palatinate' appeared to be twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, were also a problem.
Apparently, the costs increased to stunning €3.1 billion compared to the original planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly significant in view of the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, German Federal Guardian, confirmed that the Navy "was able to leave ships".
Bartels said that the problem increased over time, since old ships were taken out of service, but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the Fregats of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow for further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals, helping to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mice flea mice as well as the brown long ear and water flea mice in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and the species that makes what is determined.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, NTS Naturschutzberater, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to demonstrate how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flea stocks in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of habitat.
Windbikes and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly catchers and the chemical treatment of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Flea mice aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echooration to detect insects and obstacles in their aerodrome.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the topic of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of sleeping sites and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only Fledermausreserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermaus species.
Wellsman David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there is many things we don't know yet about bats, so we are doing these works here and to other goods, which will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, as it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire local population.
Flea mouses are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to harass them or to destroy them or their nipples.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still have to learn a lot about bats, and in many of our species we do not know how their populations are concerned."
Ronaldo rejects rape claims while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape allegations against him as "Fake News" and said that people wanted to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to prosecute the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The storm of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He then claimed to pay her $375,000 to buy her silence to the incident, according to The Mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their publication as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or into the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute the mirror on the grounds of the charges they referred to as 'inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player claimed a compensation for “moral damage to a level that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went on his knees after the alleged incident, and she said he was a '99 percent good guy' who was killed by the 'one percent'.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that they had sex, but say it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but that she had later entered into an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of revenge" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to cancel the agreement because she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer, Ronaldo switched in a 100 million euros heavy deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘forever regret the loss of car manufacturers’
The United Kingdom would 'everytime regret' if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world leader in cars, says Minister for Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He further said that it was “unsettling” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production in the Burnaston plant at Derby, if Britain would leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the effect of delays at the border in a non-deal-brexit could lead to job losses.
The factory in Burnaston, in which Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis were produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that at the end of March we will experience production stops in our factory at an uncontrolled Brexit," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about a hard EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini factory in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain with a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both the UK and the EU to manufacture cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortcomings in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to run a stockhouse in the factory in Derbyshire that would be more than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers plan on future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he explained in the program Today of BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota was unable to indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but in the long term it warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite trade union in the work, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never returns to these jobs once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to information from the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be ' postponed by another week' while the dispute about the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, said on Sunday, out of the White House.
Rosenstein has been supervising the work of Robert Mueller, Special Investigator, who investigated the electoral interference of Russia, the links between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as the possible legal obstruction by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby jeopardise Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumours in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secret records of his talks with Trump and the resignation of the President by means of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, while new reports of his alleged resignation were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced at the UN General Assembly in New York for the next Thursday,
Trump explained that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to prevent it from colliding with the hearing before the Justice Committee of the U.S. Senate, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, pronounced.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
She answered a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this; it may be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
This will show, but I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would well contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her about the reason.
Sanders said that the low frequency of press conferences did not dislike the 'effect-hazard' of the TV reporters, but admitted: 'I would not object to the fact that they are conducting effect-hazards'.
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President is making more rounds of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, without providing precise evidence: 'We have looked at these figures.'
Press conferences will still exist, however, as Sanders says, “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, but much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done so often in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in open meetings or press conferences with visiting worthy parties.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president might have shown why this was the case when he had a regular and sometimes bizarre appearance of journalists gathered before.
Health Minister writes about the Brexit concerns of EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Ministry of Health speaks to people from the EU abroad who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already expressed its willingness to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the alarming times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was reported to have been subjected to an emergency operation by Mike Organ of Tennessee State after a head injury, which he suffered on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the side line and just broke down there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the side line before being placed on a carrier and transported for further investigations.
A speaker of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "not yet known details of the nature or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State attempts to find out when the injury occurred.
Butcrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after changing from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, which increased his total number in the season to 18 Tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp taxes for real estate purchases in the United Kingdom
In the future, foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp taxes for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The additional revenues are to be used by the Conservative Party's new plans for homeless people.
This step is to stop Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will cover all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the UK, with the additional income being for homeless benefit.
This step is an attempt to prevent Jeremy Corbyn's success in young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living spaces and to take top-payers into the vision.
The increase in stamp taxes will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenues are to be attributed to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge charged in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase to second-hand dwellings introduced two years ago and to the rental of residential properties could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not established in the United Kingdom. This drives prices up and makes it more difficult for buyers to take foot in the real estate business for the first time.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spiritual cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers, which spend most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has voted for a reduction in stamp taxes to allow more young people to go home.
He accused construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable dwellings in order to end the UK's 'residential shame'."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a vivid set of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price commitment to a ban on evacuation without a good reason.
He also wants to give urban councils more powers to build new dwellings.
May explained: “I said last year that I would spend my time as Prime Minister on the restoration of the British dream, which meant that life from generation to generation should be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live here and want to work and build up a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who don't live in the UK as well as for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for heavy-working British citizens.
The dream of homelessness has become too far away for too many people and the in dignity of homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘most goal’ to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scooter enjoys the challenge to bring new life to the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One and lacks three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I managed to go to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told the show Sportsound of BBC Scotland.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland play with my father in Hampden, and that is something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the association management."
Ross's predecessor as manager of Sunderland includes Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he would not be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names in such a club after he previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment as to whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this club, he is no doubt part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here as a success if I brought the association back there."
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as Trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels better than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This was probably a real breakthrough," he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than gambling.
It sounds funny because I didn't feel bad, could live well and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But play can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to experience every week.
I still do this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so comfortable as an adult in my skin all my life."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 pm, so a study
The heat wave in summer missed the revenues from British cristal pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Public and cash companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 per cent in July. However, according to statistics, revenues from restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin from CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Permanent sunshine and England’s long-term participation in the World Football Championship meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, in which Pubs could see sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant was even more difficult.
The decline of 1.8 per cent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on drinks showed the best performance, with a surface-adjusted sales development that increased higher than it fell at the restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the leisure and restaurants industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 per cent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at any worse time for operators of companies focusing on food and it is still waiting for the lower temperatures in August to provide the urgently needed breathing break."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of more than 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has shown an increase in so-called 'Fake Insta' pages.
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they owned a "main account" to show them their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of students said they owned a clean 'main account' that they can show their parents, but also own private accounts.
One mother who hit the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked the other to " rape me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of the independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, President of the HMC, said: "It is devastating that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the vote of the athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most commonly excellent light athlete and president Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports professionals to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the light sports community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that light sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and guide the sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance of over 200 and 400 metres in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, called his own four Olympic gold medals and often appeared today as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary blood flow disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can say if or how far I will heal.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
A advertising for milk pumps that compare mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A producer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip comparing breastfeeding mothers with milking cows.
On the market, according to its own mention of the 'first gruesome portable milk pump worldwide', Elvie's consumer technology manufacturers published a not very serious music video in order to highlight the freedom that gives the pump breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a cock on me" or "if you haven't noticed it, they're not my udder but my breasts."
The refrain continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, I pump it out, I pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among the viewers, many of whom say that it is "shorts" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Like we, they have to become pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days after birth," said a comment.
The milk pump of Elvie fits into a still BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Repealable traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This kind of nonrealist advertising."
Others defended the advertising and one woman admitted that you found the song "urcomic".
“I think that's a genius idea.
I'd have bought one if I still breastfeeded.
When I pumped out, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a genius product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertising directed to mothers who use milk pumps (often on the workplace or on the toilets) and feel like "cost".
This is not advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that all have danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women using milk pumps indicate that they feel like milk cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still BH, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges associated with them, and at the same time present in a entertaining and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump entered the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were taken quietly to a tent city at the texan border
The number of internalized migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively equal, including the increased rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target for expulsion even when they log in to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supervisors and other adult members of their household should give their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high officer of the Customs Authority Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before the Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have prior entries in the criminal record.
“Approximately 80 percent of people who are either self-careers or members of a household of a caretaker are illegally residing in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In order to be able to handle the cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which, according to some children's accommodation staff, require to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days after detention, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video switching and not personally in order to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of negative decisions, the person is expelled quickly.
The longer these children are kept in custody, the more likely it is, according to information from the housing staff, as well as reports that have been reported from the system in the last month that they are fearful and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to outbreak.
Defenders say that these concerns will be reinforced in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, because of the size is easier to overlook.
They also explained that it could strengthen traumas that many of the children already suffer if they were brought to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls upon the American, French and Turkish ‘occupied forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mr Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally found on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they were treated as such.
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions more people were expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus 'will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed' by terrorist groups as well as 'any illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed around 2000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are recruited against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-boiled country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were given and he accused 'some Western countries' of 'distributing irrational fears' to prevent refugees from going home.
'We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow return to their homes', he said.
'They are politiciating a purely humanitarian matter.'
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria until there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large rebel highburg Idlib was the opportunity to promote political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the Al-Qaida Nusra Front, which will be ‘exterminated’.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a post-war Constitution for Syria and to open the way to elections.
Moualem referred to the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the 'revision of the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, as many liberal viewers probably hope to terminate his office or a scandal of his presidency in advance.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times'.
So far there are no signs that the viewers were tired.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its input rates to 1.05 million for the best broadcast time and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million spectators for the best time of broadcast, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the intake rates with 3.5 million spectators in evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that magically attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" broadcast on the ABC television station via a cabinet member, who becomes president after an attack destroyed the capital.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said: ‘When he brings me to laugh, Scovell told me.
Chaos has fun.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike everything that can be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible combination of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabled is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it is also important to be an informed citizen when one is aware of having seen six hours of an expert tour on Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called 'Deep Background' for his book 'Fear', Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket made of straw leather (when Washington Post says a 'cloth rich in self-assessment') or discussing the effects of Stormy Daniel's rigorous description of Trumps, oh, anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he does can feel like a reality show he presents to you every evening," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series "The Three of the Pfandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily action applications (breaking a fight with the Football League NFL from the fence, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a result, otherwise you don't come with me anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he broke inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He just couldn't get rid of the screen, not if judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy broadcasts at the time and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization”,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donation money flies the closest races to seats in the Congress at the mid-elections
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly drawn borders of the constituency, which led to two officials standing in the race around the same seat.
The newly signed suburb district in Pittsburg will allow the Democrats Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is highly overlaping with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were violated against the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of campaign funding between the large financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a popular special election in March around the 18th constituency of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican over a decade, and Trump won with 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats a light leadership.
The United States examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partner kicked out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign delegations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to 'the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, Minister of Foreign Affairs in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was thought of penalties, which were estimated to have received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represented a step forward in their efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively concluded the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference held in mid-October in order, according to diplomats, to give a sign of the importance that the government has given to the Assembly.
The three American diplomatic representatives have returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new rigorous messages or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings under the condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the conditions of anonymity.
Learn from History
The next great surprise could be the report of Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible legal obstacle, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now also supposed to investigate whether Trump's electoral team has been conspiring with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the congress majority change, Trump faces an institution that makes him accountable at the moment when he passes by to go back before the voters; and possibly before a jury.
These are many ‘If’ and I do not want to say that the Donald Trump case, or the case of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were prepared to take a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history turns around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump releases Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the Devil's kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculate on the top of the office.
Rosenstein dementies the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly commissioned FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed in office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and falsehood?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-elections for a congress that compels Trump to be accountable?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to ignite sabbath pots on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive Remis against Villareal in Spain will place them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League at the beginning of the month.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 equation against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger.
"This was an important point for us because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we went home with one point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but in general, an indecision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we did work in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, however, this will be a heavy game because they achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to handle them, few talked about them with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study said to talk to your spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to lead the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Insurance Unit.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenditures.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Dispute at last minute.
If you have a precautionary authority so that you order a familiar person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express it yourself.
Consider also a power for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan, so you are ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
Due to the failure of the communication systems, helpers were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, there were estimated 299,200 people living in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue for the Central Sudan economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The reduction of nickel is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawese.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West-Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indish Ocean, of which almost half in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shocked the western coast of Sumatras between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands in front of the coast of Sumatras.
2006: A strong 6.8 earthquake shocked the southern Javas, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A strong 7.6 earthquake met the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength 7.5 shocked one of Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shocked the government district Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died through a crashing building.
2018: Serious earthquakes met the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular among tourists, and, above all, claimed over 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaska and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested due to allegations of body injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of reporting domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from one of the acquaintances when they wanted to contact the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in detention in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of 500 dollars was collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when he was asked for his petition, he answered with "Not guilty, absolutely certain" the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A irregularities, which can be punished with up to one year of imprisonment and a fine of up to USD 250,000.
He is also charged with a class B irregularity, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges were brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under drug influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend threw him for hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after bringing the behaviour of her son back to a post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi shocked on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of the coast of Central Sudan, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Public Prosecutor demands rare death penalty for suspects in New York’s terrorist attack
The U.S. Attorney in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the New York City terrorist attack, who cost eight lives. This is a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the building market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which he ran on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, passing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight Ofer 'targeted' and added "consciously" serious injuries, as stated in the declaration of intent on the claim for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Criminal Court Saipov filed a 22-point indictment involving eight accusations of murder in the context of the organized crime, which are normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'basic planning and intention', according to the prosecutors who described the way in which Saipov acted as 'abominable, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses," explains the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer persecuted a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a lifelong sentence in September 2009.
The last time in New York the death penalty was committed in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been accused two years earlier of the conspiracy of committing spying for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He announced before investigators that he felt good with what he did, according to the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was actually inspired after he had looked at videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the complaint.
He also called for the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, according to police information.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were “securitally disappointed” due to the decision of the Public Prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty will only extend the trauma that all parties suffer, rather than a confession of guilt in exchange for a lifelong sentence without the possibility of dismissal," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had asked the charges before not to claim the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for Nigel FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Mr Farage swore today to mobilize the 'power of the people' during a protest campaign in the context of the Tories Conference.
The former head of the Ukip Party stated that politicians must feel the "pressure" of the euroscepticists, while a member of the Theresa May Party suggested that Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Rear Banker Peter Bone explained to the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “already outside” if Farage Brexit was a minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciling its deep-disputed party has been exacerbated by the participation of members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, in a separate demonstration against the Brexit which took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping Chequer's compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and therefore force Eurosceptics and the Oppositional Labour Party to choose between her package and the chaos.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the garbage’.
He proposed that Farage should have been appointed a peer and should have given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he was responsible for it, then we would be out there already,’ he explained.
The member of Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for the Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We did not fight in wars to be subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit-proponent of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and explained to reporters: ‘I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is un popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is un popular in our own party and among our activists who actually walk through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a splendour message to May she continued: ‘The Prime Minister keeps her jobs if you keep her promises.’
Farage explained in a speech that politicians have to ‘feel the pressure’, they should be in the process of deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class’, according to Farage.
‘They are trying to cheat the Brexit and that is why we are here today to say to them, ‘that doesn’t mean you get away.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is just ahead of betraying the Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We mobilise the power of the people of this country, who will help us to win in the referendum and never come to peace as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
A few activists shifted banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, just like all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
‘This is a Farce.
There is just not the good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘exactly examine’ presidential candidate
The US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the elections in November, she would "examine the presidential candidate carefully".
The Boston Globe reports that the democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future on Saturday at a meeting with voters in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican MP in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's entry.
One of the people here asked her if you wanted to candidate for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be for women at the time to "go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shooting on LSU player Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday in the event of fatal shots on LSU Basketball player Wayde Sims.
At a press conference, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday they had published a video of the shooting and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shooting injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," says the sports media portal 247sports by police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene and possession of a weapon and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 launches in the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great prize from Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world championship after leaving his team victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in Qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's stable orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas succeeded in a good start and it was almost as if he performed Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton get into the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind Vettel, but overcame Hamilton after a narrow wheel-an-wheel manoeuvre, where the Ferrari pilot, resistantly released the inside, with the risk of endured two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the rear squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on seven.
He was the fastest for most of the race, since he stopped his tyres to quickly end and to beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished as fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri has done an excellent performance all weekend and how a true gentleman has acted when he should leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of a election event on Saturday about Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted not to have passed the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement to the Senate's Justice Committee did not address directly, but commented that the events in the Senate showed that people were “common, evil and dishonest”.
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see anger when you see people who are angry and cruel and evil and dishonest," says the President.
"When you look at the leaks and then say, "Oh, that wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Posted the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was played with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was published in early September. However, Feinstein refuses that the leak is from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," said Feinstein, according to information from The Hill, to the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for confidentiality."
Her dementi seemed not to be well at the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, the democrats claimed that the accusations would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the community, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control," the President said Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer achieved two gates for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5:3 victory in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two gates, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard appeared to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two gates.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe who hit Dundee unexpectedly on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant won the three previous parties.
Dwyer's opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the leadership.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie reached its counter after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the leadership of the Giants before the mid-term break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again looked out with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen bring Dundee into the game for the first time late in the second half of the season. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth gate after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in the Milton Keynes Stadium on Friday.
Pilot died after he was sure that hundreds of people escaped from the earthquake in a plane
A pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to make a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong afterbearings are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped under dooms in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could be lifted safely.
He then jumped out of the Tower when he thought he would crash.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia's ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousand. The State Civil Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
'The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the drains, while others cannot be reached', said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Wells up to 6 meters above sea level have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and, in a speech in front of the country’s military, he said: “I ask you to work every day and night to do all the tasks involved in the evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing person after aircraft crash in Lagune
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports a missing person after it first claimed that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the declining plane.
Air Niugini stated in a message that they could not say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water during the attempt to land on the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline stated that there were six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, but that they were in a stable condition.
The cause and the precise course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both declared that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the landing track.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane flew beyond the landing track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wipe through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the crewmen panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that the marina, working close to the improvement of a site, hurried with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane fell into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 persons have died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accusation closed her evidence in the re-trial of a case in which a man was accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said that he received position data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the witness stand on Saturday and said he hadn't been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied "when my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis announced that Chambers had known two weeks at the time of her death.
Mobile records, however, pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost some time after Chamber's death their messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He removed them from his life," said Hale.
Defense is expected to begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then be held before the jury on that day.

A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that Hip Hop has removed its roots from political embassy and social commitment.
They want to return to his roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York babygirl sues couple for dismissal after "rassistic" SMS
A New York childbird accused a couple of discriminating dismissal after receiving a misleading message from the mother, in which she complained that she was still a black woman.
The couple contested being racist and compared the dispute with a "extortion".
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her frustration when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NO ONE SWARZE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognising her Fauxpas, Plasco-Flaxman resigned Maurice and claimed that the open-ended Afro-American day mother had done bad work and had instead expected a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice charges the couple for compensation for the redundancies and claims for compensation for the 350 dollars per day that it should have due for over six months for the job for which it had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she explained to the newspaper on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple rejected the accusations of racism and argued that the resignation was the reasonable step because they feared Maurice, after they had insulted them, not to be able to trust anymore.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children to a person who was uncomfortable to them, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with a "extortion" and explained that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is "in a difficult situation".
“You want such a person to be interested?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in the public and accused of social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: “It is difficult to move into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge today of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, would have been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication was “bitter sweet” after his death last year.
She explained that your father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as “very important family member”.
"He was a very quiet man and didn't pronounce," said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you're proud, even if it wasn't really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chances," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the pump sounded slowly and left her body.
She had just died before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to rip myself up."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane together with the other passengers who didn't know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she told.
I had fallen my head and tears ran all the time over my wrinkles.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives by a suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hanged on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting stations.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel like I feel every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was coming to a promising career as a cook and had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smiles could enlighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after his suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have an effect."
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people to go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom. When the children packed out their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that had to go through: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the swing while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something that he asked, i.e. a time-limited and limited investigation, then we might get a little insult," said Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want FBI investigations?
Your reluctance can be relied on the timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone listener to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide in case of equality of votes, and to confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean cruisers ‘sinkt’ under Kim
The number of North Korean crosses to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who is calling for data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 cross-passers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher human smuggler prices than main factors.
Pjöngjang did not make public statements about this.
The majority of the overrunners from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean States.
China sees the traffickers rather as illegal immigrants than as refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still in the state of war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pyongyang to talk about the terminated denuklearisation negotiations.
This was done as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, in which they agreed generally to work on a deuklearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to unarm us one-sided first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t refrain from the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented all the accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stood shortly ahead of it when he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him a “great and coordinated call murder” organized by Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because she showed that he was prejudicial to democrats.
"I believe that he has declared himself inappropriate even with these statements and the way in which he was here about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court but also for his current judgeship," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Appeals Court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, precedented person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'It's not wonderful'," says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere speech of hatred, months and years of overcooking anger and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “A woman who was a manager was helping me a lot, and she said that she was crying when she became angry, but developed a technique. If she became angry and started crying, she said to the person she said: “They might think she was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I thought it was genius."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is a former job, in a man-dominated office, where one day I was crying because of an indescriptive anger, and by an older woman, a undercooled manager, who I was always a little afraid of, packed on my throat and moved into a staircase.
"Let's never see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinker.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Congressman, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship named Monkey Business in a non-marriage relationship and then withdrawn his candidateship, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"This was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Somebody called the situation: ‘Snowwhites and the seven dwarfs.
As the election campaign had already been advanced, it was in the back of the acquisition of funds and she swore not to apply if she did not get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, only supported their campaign with $250.
"Do they believe I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
She was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to obtain funds and direct address the voters instead of the delegates, as well as the anger about sexism, that she was close to the tears.
"You could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handcuff manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the USA and China
The opening ointments of the trade war between the USA and China were drowning. Although the battle is not yet over long, Beijing could benefit from a long-term tomb between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American President, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he ordered important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with criminal duties.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new criminal duties on goods worth 200 billion dollars, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing hit the same way every time and recently imposed criminal duties of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China swore to respond to any US action, and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to insinuate would mean giving up. However, a public incubation against the US would be much too tasty for China's president Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually far more dangerous than many observers have recognized before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific collaborator who focuses on Asia at the Think Factory Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests assistance for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the over seven years of war.
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
'Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government will rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and living conditions.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed assistance in the reconstruction of the desolate country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any conditional assistance from countries that had supported the revolt.
Europe succeeded in victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and since 1993 it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the USA.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over most of the tournament, lowered his drop on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in his current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who possibly played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t stand back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the pokal back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He goes on to his landsman John Rahm, who won Tiger Woods in the solo meetings against the American golf legend on Sunday 2:1.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods I've been following on TV since my childhood," says the 23-year-old cream.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup ball of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is only exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hut off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
