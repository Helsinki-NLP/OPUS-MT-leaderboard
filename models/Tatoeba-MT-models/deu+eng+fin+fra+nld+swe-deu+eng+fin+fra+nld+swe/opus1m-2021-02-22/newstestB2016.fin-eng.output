The 9-year-old boy who escaped from Tampere was found
The police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The report of disappearance of a boy who moved with his friend from West Tampere has been spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and he has no risk of life and health.
The father of the boy told the night-Sanoma when he knew that he was found.
He's okay, and now we're gonna start the ex-post.
The boy was found in the neighborhood, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, again, scratched the painting to the Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paintings in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to work in the Champions' league.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo from the champion's league was turned to the last advantage for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo alone moved to the top of the goalmaker statistics of all ages when he shot a visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of penalty shots and one of the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his balance to 80, when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess, who was playing a record, has 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been compiling in the Italian Football League in Serie A since the beginning, but in the Masters League D, it started with a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winner was made over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city attack bored the absence of Sergei Aguero's kneeling ship.
Aguero, who was injured at the weekend's election gaming game, came to the field only in the last 10 minutes.
The second company of Manchester United also experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
Luke Shaw's 20-year-old teamman's visitor's fight only lasts a quarter.
Hector Moreno's dangerous sliding clause hit the paint towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke a riot leg.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of the Eindhoven home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to 1-0 in 41 minutes, but ManU's joy only took a few minutes.
Moreno was up to the rest of the time before the break.
Luciano Narsingh was the winner of PSV in the second half of the time.
The season of painting in the Champions League began in the A-site Paris Saint-Germain.
The case was replaced by the Argentine Angel Di Maria with the PSG shirt of Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball to the back of the ball past Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made PSG 2-0 for the second half of the time.
PSG has been betting among the successors of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, belonging to the league's small associations, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, PSG's star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, Tsjechia, lost in the B-B game in Germany at Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce. The president made the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, held the same speech that he had held a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has held the same speech in Parliament again that he held at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether Mugabe, 91, is in full spirit.
MDC called for Mugabe to quit his mission because this is too old to control.
Mugabe's assistants hurried to say that the confusion had just happened in the Mugabe board and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now about the Chinese impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council, will assess the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe could be more effectively registered.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, included in the internal ministerial table.
Professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb at the University asked for a voice in an emergency call from the police of the tricks at home and told me he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their dear dog was alive and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the deceased woman’s family would be on her phone.
The police inside the house found Amy Prentis's body and a message written on the white paper: "I am very sorry and I hope I can withdraw my action. I loved Amya, and she's the only woman who never loved me," said the authorities in the letter signed by Lambi.
There were no signs that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University at Mississippi's Cleveland, had already traveled 500 km away to the school campus. The police found Professor Ethan Schmidt, who was thought to have shot Lambin, who was dead at the campus.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university's office was informed of the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
He said that Lamb called a fateful emergency call some time after this.
There was one more death on the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police found him.
The next day, students and teaching staff stayed behind the locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lambi’s motive.
Scientists explored the details in both places, and Lambi's familiar teachers told us about the man, and they were able to find a picture of a talented but perhaps a problematic teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to a professor's hours.
According to the Gautier Police Department of Prentiss, the professor had no previous evidence of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned in a book written by Lambi, with which he had given recognition to "loving people" with whom he was allowed to spend academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with 17 teaching staff. Many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, references to problems emerged.
Lambia's praised student Brandon Beavers told me that the professor seemed upset and nervous, "as if he had something wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him about stress at the end of the academic year 2014–2015.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for sick leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's wage policy meant that the claim for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the position of assistant professor.
The University Director William LaForge told me that there was no knowledge of conflicts between Lambi and Schmidt, but said that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the camp, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lambi, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber gun in the backyard of the house in Mississippin Greenville, about a mile away from the home of his parents, Washington County Death Detective Methel Johnson.
Lambi's car was still on the steep road.
The police didn't immediately know why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told me that he believed that he knew the inhabitants of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a teacher in geography and education at the University with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He was given a doctoral grade in education in spring.
One of Lambi’s long - term friends described this as intelligent, karismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met Lambi through his common friends when she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old.
He was still in high school with friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar play for years.
"Then Lamb was a pretty heartbreaker.
All the girls were on her side," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb in Brandon.
Looks like Lamb and Prentiss had met for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but no document says they've been married.
The couple had a dog called Lightning, and they lived in a stone house in the riverside in Gautier's small town.
According to the police, the dog was fine.
Prentiss's former husband Shawn O'Steen told me she had divorced Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was totally shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lambi but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they sometimes also called together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and plays his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, reported that he had seen Lambi and Prentiss on 5 September when Lamb had played guitar and lipsharp to the harsh audience.
There was nothing to say that something was wrong.
"Good couple," Shaffer said.
"We chose together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who received his blessing, led seminars for the first year and specialised in the history of Indians and colonial times," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own brotherhood and college.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people met in the candlelight commemorative event. There were teaching staff, other staff, students and residents in the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the evening event where the university choir presented songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi about Cleveland.
Assistant journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police now tell us that Lamb called an emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and that although Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife in an emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers
The Toys R Us company is not going to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the retailer of toys and baby products tells us that he will offer its current employees and seasonal workers a chance for additional hours of work.
The company intends to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month, and new workers will start in October to December.
Although there are still months for the holiday, the trade season is approaching good speed, and companies are preparing by employing temporary labour in stores and for shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana
Returning to the future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal meaning.
"We sat at the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. I found that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me that the back in time document was coming in the trailer.
"When the film started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document relates to the return to the future movies, and the document interviews Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie returns to the future got its first night 30 years ago.
"This movie is definitely a time travel movie for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be presented in selected cinemas from October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moo commented on Russia's intensified military action and noted that almost five years of conflict was not a military solution and that weapons only brought more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General reiterated its call on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite its strength and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference held on Wednesday, Ban told us about his intention to meet with five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Mr Ban regretted the fact that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has caused a situation which is impossible to resolve.
Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis, with which the nuclear agreement in Iran was reached.
8 chapters of support questions: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trumpia has been tried to stamp as an empty speaker.
He's also been thought to be a joke.
Some of them predict the collapse of Trump.
In the Republican circles (to date), all efforts have been made to pull Trump down from the gallup management.
Twenty-eleven national gallups show Donald Trump two-digit support numbers. Some are already seriously considering what it practically tells about the prospects of a property mogul.
However, the elections are only at the beginning.
No one has yet been informed that Trump is elected as a Republican candidate.
Experts recall that Rick Perry, who was at the top of the gall in 2011, was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain. Neither finally won the candidate elections in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would be difficult at the general elections.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth, have noticed the strong position of Trump and started digging his bubbles to drop him.
The following recent gallup data indicate that the property mold cannot be ignored by the tail:
There has been a complete translation of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced being a candidate in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University gallup, only two of the ten Republicans had a positive image of the property mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive picture.
At the beginning of August the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now, six of the ten Republicans have a positive picture of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures are also considered to be the first in the states where elections are held.
In the Quinnipiac gallup last week, 60% of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two third Republicans would be satisfied with Trump's candidateship.
Last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans at the CNN and ORC gallup said they were very satisfied or satisfied with the possible choice of Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the ten would be very discontented for Trump's candidateship.
Ben Carson brings about almost as much enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent would be very pleased with Carson's candidateship and 40 per cent of Trump's candidateship).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
Thirdly, Marco Rubio, with a corresponding percentage of 21 %.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperament of Trump to be a problem.
Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for the insult and insulting comments. 52 percent of the Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the property mugg to be suitable for the president.
The same is true of Iowa, where the first party meeting is held: According to Quinnipiac, 52 per cent of the Republicans consider Trump’s personal characteristics to be suitable for the Chief Defence Officer.
However, according to ABC and Post gallup, 44 percent believe that Trump is unable to function effectively, and six of the ten consider Trump’s temperament incompatible with the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, according to CNN and ORC gallup, four out of ten believes in Trump's opportunities.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten people would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Totality: The Republicans have not had a very reliable crystal ball before.
At this stage in the last elections, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry to be a probable candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Although the Republicans would support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that the split camp is likely to benefit from Trumpi when Trump's opponents split up into the supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, the opinion of Monmouth University revealed that in the imaginary dual struggle between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would have a larger support force almost always.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's on level.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take a victory from Trump in a 19-point biased battle.
The limited majority of Trump's supporters tells us that they have already taken a vote.
According to the gallup published on Tuesday by CBS and NYT, the fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their decision to vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46 % of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trumpi's most competitive at this moment is neurochirurg Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates will vote twice as likely as Trumpia.
Six of the ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of the immigration.
In his campaign speech called Donald Trump two months ago, migrants who came from Mexico as rapers, the immigration has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's powerful speeches will ban important Latin American voters from the republican forces and hinder brand reform.
However, according to the opinion measurement results of ABC News and Washington Post published on Monday, six of the ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump.
As long as the immigration is in light, there is also Donald Trump.
Discontent with the administration is at the top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican voices. The fact that both of them have come out of the competition is an important addition to the recommendation.
The Republican forces want to be a candidate for a fresh face instead of a political conkar. According to the latest assessment of the views of ABC News and Washington Post, this was about the Republicans six out of ten.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to the assessment made by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa have been frustrated by the Republicans in the Congress: 54 per cent are unhappy and 21 per cent on the edge of anger."
Jeremy Corby debuted at the Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, Mr Corbyn's first attendance at the Prime Minister's Question Time was awaited.
Jeremy Corbyn's new labour force image, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to rise for the first time to measure his strength by David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corby's first six questions are asked a little later than half a day.
Corby has asked for less theater and adds facts to the weekly show.
He has also said that he could miss some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed up for the first time and will now be subjected to a parliamentary test after the Shadow Government meeting and Corby's Trade Unions' Central Assembly at the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
The Labour Party's decision to silence the national song during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War held on Tuesday has been criticised by several Tory representatives, and the silence has also ended up in the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence in national songs attracted attention
Corbyn’s representative noted Corbyn’s standing during the national song in silence respecting the heroicity of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, in the BBC Two's Newsnight program, Mr. Owen Smith of the shadow government of Corbyn said that the leader of the party would have urged to join the national song despite the opposition to this monarchy.
Ten Shadow Ministers have refused to join Corbyn's 1st team, calling for disagreements in economic, defence and foreign matters, and less than one-six of the parties initially supported Corbyn's election to the party's leadership.
BBC's policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements on the UK EU membership and on the conditions for granting benefits imposed by the government have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour intends to propose amendments to eliminate restrictions in full.
Hourly later, Minister of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government Smith said that the party's position is very clear: it is only opposed to the government's plans to reduce the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour Director, whom David Cameron has met over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The new approach, promised by the Labour Director, says that he has chosen the questions to Cameron on the 30,000 proposals he has received from the public.
According to Corbyn, who was elected from the Islington North electoral district, he has too many interlocutions, and he promises to avoid smart wording and lending and instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and young people's challenges.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister, will attend her by questionnaire hours, for example when Cameron is on his way abroad.
Mr Corby has also raised the idea that others may also sometimes be able to speak, and he tells us that he has discussed this with Mr Bercow, President of the House.
Since Corbyn joined the party in 2005, Cameron said he wanted a doll-theater policy, which is often associated with the question hour, but some years later he admitted that he had failed in his efforts.
Since the first time in 1990, the survey was held as a central measure of the director's rating, sub-room management and position, but the critics said that the survey was a cartoonist who needed substantial reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a homeless environment.
For the group of former streets, there has been a meaningful way to learn and earn.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their homeland and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has completed the project among the first ones.

The red strengthens when British wages rise
The red was strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index.
In May-July, wages rose by 2.9% in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not calculated.
The faster growth forecast was the fastest since 2009.
The red was confirmed by 1% and its price was recorded at $1.5505. The red was also confirmed in relation to the euro, and recorded at EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended to 6,229.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course was 20 per cent painful when the company received a preliminary purchase offer from the competing company AB InBevil.
When trading would bring together the world's two largest brewery companies and bring the same brands under the roof, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the Richemont Group, which was concentrated on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than predicted. The development of sales was also based on the rises in Burberry’s key market in China.
Glencore's share increased by 5 per cent of its declared intention to collect $2.5 billion in equity as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packing and paper series Mond were the largest dropper of 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's prices for sales purposes.
The course of JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports industry had been informed that its return before taxes would rise by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage expenditures could hamper enlargement
According to Mr Peter Cowgilli, Chairman of the JD Sports Management Group, the increase in minimum wages in the United Kingdom would increase purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs may jeopardise JD Sports expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches the grass root campaign against Aldi's spine
Metcash is trying to secure its IGA store from Aldi's power in South and West Austria.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass root campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retailers in South and West Australia against Aldin's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centers and the first up to 120 stores in South and Western Austria at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build IGA brands by marketing mainstreaming and social media, and by organising events like the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory Simmo in Dunsborough offers taste in IGA stores, and retailers sell flags for South Australian football club games at a discount price.
It is expected that Metcash will publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trade Bag organises an annual investment strategy day.
This is an important market, since South and Western Austria account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash IGA stores, and in these areas, the overall yield is higher than the IGA network of the eastern states.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their corners, and IGA traders in the region have a much higher market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Austria, the market share is 30% and in Western Austria 24%, while in the eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysis believes that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that the sales of IGA dealers can be sold by 360 million and Metcash by the end of 2016.
The projection is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Austria next year and will be able to sell $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
The fixed costs of Metcash are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can lead to a loss of $13 million in the result before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan's recent study shows that IGA's customers are most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s sales of food will decrease by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group's leading portfolio manager Hamish Douglass told Melbourne that it was very likely that Metcash would disappear in ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that the Metcash government member contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and the results of Metcash food business activities serving IGA’s 1200 dealers have fallen by 43 per cent from the 2012 level.
However, the wholesaler is taking counter action and makes an annual bet of more than $150 million in Australia to meet the prices of Coles and Woolworth for hundreds of products every week. The chain wants to support retailers in renovating their stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food range of their own brands.
According to Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, price review and sales reform plans are at good pace, and the company will be able to increase its profit again in 2017 for the first time for four years.
President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his behaviour rather than criticism.
According to the Australian tennis union president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios junk. Kokkinakis deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
The younger part of the duel named "Special K" Kokkinakis was disproportionate when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly after this, in the match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison played in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate the competitors twice. "Wawrinkan should have given his back to Kyrgyzstan and my friend," Harrison said.
In the US open, Kokkinakis hit frustratedly into the field of the battle when strong cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth from the second single player behind Bernard Tomici in the semifinal of Davis Cup against the UK.
"I am strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has been attracted to the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the battle when losing the fight in the open of the United States. He is not at all the first player to break his battle because of frustration. I feel Thanas well that he is not proud of his action.
However, he has been very well endured, for example, the provocative behaviour of Harrison in the openness of the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a glossary around him, and I think he's only been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature for the age of 19, he works hard and supplements well the team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He exercises hard, is in good condition and really stable and mature young man. I think he should be assessed on the basis of his own merites."
Healy also supported the decision to drop from Kyrgios Australia's team from an important round starting Friday. Healy describes the solution to a joint decision for all parties. However, he supports the return of the Canberran breeder to a long-term reinforcement of the team.
"On the first hand, we want to focus fully on the fights instead of polemics related to Kyrgyzstan," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, a young man has to grow up in the light of the publicity. He deserves criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him so that he can understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to make him feel free. I believe it's the best thing for both the entire team and Nick."
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
On Tuesday, Hungary, who declared an emergency, closed its southern border from Serbia's direction and captured illegal invaders, with the aim of preventing the flow of the migrant.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-one country, and the Serbian authorities reacted sadly.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay in their roadside tents between country inspection stations for an indeterminate period
The frustration began to rise to the surface.
When a police helicopter flew over the air, they shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police.
Some of them began to protest for eating and drinking.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that it did not accept the return of immigrants to Hungary at the same time as more people arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in the next few days in Brussels and in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The death at the Hungarian-Serbia border began a day later when the 28-State group failed to develop a common immigration policy at the controversial meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the flood of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is common, and the meeting raised the hope that by the end of next month or year an agreement would be reached on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extra summit for the next week to discuss the continental immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on urgent action in Brussels or the neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergencies developed so that in two southern regions, the authorities were allowed to use more effective means, namely to close you and speed up the legal processes relating to asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter Szijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a steak wire to the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that the Serbian border is already ready to run.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the bidding for the finalisation of the work of steak wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottlenecks and a point of transit to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the incoming people are living-level refugees, not soldiers who have the right to seek security.
The new law, which came into force in Hungary at the time of midnight, provides for a crime to exceed or damage the four-metre-hitted steak wire, which has been built by the government on the southern border in the direction of Serbia, and for the longer periods of imprisonment for convicted human traders.
"As a result of immigration, the government declares crisis," told journalist Zoltan Kovacs to journalists in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
"We follow a rigorous line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to accept military action, as is expected next week. The Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavy armed soldiers and their vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Orban's Internal Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities have caught 45 attempted cross-borders immediately and 15 further away.
They're now in possession of the police, and they're charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points of Serbia on Tuesday.
Kaaos took over the main border crossing site near Roszke in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container where people were packed in.
About 20 people could get in, but thousands left out.
Another group of immigrants locked the main street that unites Serbia and Hungary. People reported to be in the food and drink shop until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership in relation to Bernie Sanders declined by national gallup
The percentage of the support of the former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still two-digit competition as a national presidential candidate for Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has gone away.
Clinton's support is now 47 per cent of the votes of the democrats (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential office, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the pre-elections, it is too early to tell most democrats who they support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more confident about their choice.
After CBS News last month, Clinton has lost its support for a number of democratic groups, while Sanders' camp has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has been reduced.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly, and he only has a 5 percent stake in the Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among democracies under the age of 50, and he is now on a level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among the parent voters.
Last month, the front line of Clinton's contributions to Sanders was two-digit among the Liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points to Clinton in this group.
About half of the democrats would like to announce their support for Clinton if he was elected as a party candidate.
The fourth would support Clinton with the smallest reservations, and 15 per cent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It is probably not surprising that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic, even if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more fragmentation among those who aren't in favour of Clinton at the moment. Only about a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
In fact, 48 per cent of the democratic voters would support Clinton, and only 35 per cent of the Republican voters would enthusiastically support Donald Trumpi, the most popular Republican candidate.
When Clinton's voters are asked to freely describe why they support his candidateship, the most popular reason is Clinton's right experience (16 per cent). The second most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female president (13 per cent) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
In addition, there are consistent views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President still pounded his potential candidateship, and 57 percent of the democratists wished he would go along with the race, and the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the democratic voters are asked to be the second most popular candidate for the party, most of them choose Biden.
From Clinton's supporters over half, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and much more popular with Sander's.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democrats' candidate competition, Hillary Clinton will increase his advance from Sanders. With Sanders, the advance is 20 percentage points, and it will grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of the democrats think Clinton is a candidate who has the best chance to win the real elections, but this percentage has fallen from 78 % last month.
The second Biden is far from Clinton, but more and more believes in Biden's ability to win the real elections.
However, the democratic voters consider the views on issues more important than the winning opportunities of candidates.
Voters do not consider anyone unacceptable to the candidates or potential candidates.
Voters consider candidates for democracy or potential candidates to be suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sander and Biden are honest, reliable and leaders.
Biden is most likely to be honest, whereas Clinton is most likely to be a leader.
Even 30% of the democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, and 15% of Sanders. 27% can't say if Sanders are honest.
In the opinion of the democrats, the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to their own ideology.
For all the features about a quarter, there is no opinion on Sanders.
When asked about the views of voters on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Foreign Minister, most of the voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and have not changed the view of these voters on Clinton.
The Americans more widely disagree.
Half of the Americans are unsatisfactory with Clinton's report, and only one third is satisfied.
The people’s views were shared in March, when the confusion had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the picture has changed in a negative direction.
The majority of these 36 percent, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when asked about the views of all the voters: Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy only 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters throughout the country do not consider Trumma to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are given good ratings of leadership.
Of the six candidates involved, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority thinks Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many do not have any opinion on Sanders.
The sample of the poll is 351 voters and the margin of error of the poll is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson holds Donald Trump's front line in the national support call
According to CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trumpi.
These two candidates doubled more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The share of support has risen from 23 per cent of the CBS survey conducted before the debate held last month by Fox News. According to the survey published on Tuesday, the share of support is 27 per cent.
However, Carson's support would be a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the question, Carson has a strong support in all the groups of the population, and in the high-skilled group he beats Trump sharply.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are staying far away. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio in Florida divided third place by 6%.
The error margin of 376 Republican voters in the sample is 6 per cent in the direction or another.
According to the latest survey published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is rising and 19% of the Republicans are in favour when Trump's support is 32 %.
In the latest ABC News and Washington Post survey, Trump was also in clear leadership before Carson.
At the men's meeting last week, Trump lodged irrevocable charges to a retired neurochirurg, but Carson apologised for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he campaigned in Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of Baruch College's death
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Ps department at Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally abused Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Dengi in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes had been tied, his back had been placed with almost 15 kilos of sand filled bag and had been attacked repeatedly in his attempt to reach the target that had been placed on the other side of the ice field.
First, Deng was told to complain about headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, Pi Delta Ps's members didn't call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they're supposed to have waited an hour before they took Deng to the hospital.
At the press conference, police officer Chris Wabner told us that members had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact the president of the department, Andy Meng.
"To this stage members began to hide the tools, setting the department's interest ahead of the health of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng was not recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsie protocol, Deng had been beaten several times in the head, upper body and thighs with a dumb object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the sparkling of the department, since at least one student per year has died as a result of sparking since 1970," says Deng's family representative, Douglas Fierberg.
The parties and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
The large jury of the Monroe district presented five members of the department to be charged with murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with bribery and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to have an even responsibility not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally accepted the smuggling," Wagner told at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the operation of the department, and the national department terminated the operation of the local department.
This will affect the rise in interest rates of the US Central Bank (Fed)
The increase in interest rates and the growth period of the stock market are deteriorating, the return on securities is rising and the economy is moving down.
That's what we know.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it takes and how long it takes.
In particular, as regards the economy, we find evidence in history of the timing.
Lama has arrived in up to 11 months after the first increase of interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises aggressive interest rates, although not always; the decisive factor is how economic and financial assets react.
That is why the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates, but to how long it takes to normalise the situation.
Of course, there are several variables.
Finally, however, market operators can notice that any increase in interest rates may be excessive.
"The first lifting of the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Capital Economics's global chief economist told its customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalization of interest rates at a fairly low level. It is a scary standing shock for many.
However, it does not mean that there are no effects.
Examples based on these historical trends of how the impact can be seen in the various sectors of the economy:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, the increase in interest rates may increase instability for some time.
When the interest rates finally rise, the effect is not that dramatic.
"The trend seems to be the rise in capital interest returns after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy, the German Bank analyst noted in the recent study of the impact of the increase in interest rates.
Specificated over 35 years, the market is generally seen at the time of the rise of interest rates, around 14 per cent, fairly steady following 250 days (average increase 2.6 per cent), after 500 days, the situation normalizes, and the average return on interest after the six-year ratio is 14,4 per cent, says Bob Doll, the Head Equity Strategyst of Nuvea Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares usually increases at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest returns are starting to decrease.
The depression is a reality in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually occurs.
In this case, if the central bank faces conditions which were not previously in place and which could accelerate the fall rate.
Particular attention should be paid to the fact that the gross domestic product is the lowest ever in view of the increase in the central bank's control interest rate.
According to the Deutsche Bank, 118 steer interest rates were raised since 1950, only two times the nominal value was below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it would last, and in the third quarter it will be 1.5 per cent, reports the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
In such a sensitive economic situation, interest increases may be at risk and can be asked whether this situation is different, German said.
In the market, operators have talked about the increase of the tax rate throughout the year, and the views will turn to the meeting of this week's Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and economies believe that even if the Open Market Committee would approve the lifting at this meeting, the fair trade is only likely to be 25%.
"In our studies since 1950, all the upward cycles have been in a supercyclical cycle, where GDP also rises very quickly before the downward trend," says the report.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression during the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last depression. The record had been 35 months, now is already on the 74th month.
In addition, fixed-income securities have been unstable in advance of interest rates on the market, and the formula is also recurring on the capital side.
"The basic difference is that the impact in bonds is faster than in shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bond debts, return appears to change the direction immediately when the first rise/calculation cycle starts.
At the end of the rise cycle, returns will fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategicists believe that the interest rate will bring long and short-term bonds closer to each other and the curve will be aligned.
"High-income bonds are often better done in such an environment, although we are still cautious about yields," said Schwab's real-income securities analyst Kathy Jones.
Intriguingly, Jones said that the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the increase in the dollar and the inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of alignment with the tightening of financial policy," says Jones.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the return curve is straight, the credit risk margins have increased and the volatility has increased.
In general, companies operating mainly on the US market will benefit as interest rates are falling and local products are starting to attract.
The prospects of indebted multinationals are weaker, as the dollar is increasing, making their products more expensive in the global market and the debts more expensive.
"History shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analyses tell its customers.
Enterprises with strong balance sheets were beaten by an average of five percentage points after interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares also managed better in their quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
"The one is a big question.
Enterprises with a significant share of variable interest rates in debt will lose the most," Goldman said.
In addition to the stock market, consumers are generally benefiting from the increase in the dollar.
Savers will also benefit thanks to higher yields, although experts disagree about how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for excessive popularization.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor.
Also claims BBC Music Awards awards only as a copy of the British gaala.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, for his part, is accusing the Voice channel of impersonality.
According to the important parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually becomes a copy of the Classic FM channel. The charges increase the pressure on the station to prove that it offers more than one commercial radio station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC's leadership that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer exactly separated from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to change in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards Prize, which was held last December, also receives criticism from Bingham:
"The last year, the BBC Music Awards for the first time, seems to be a copy of the British Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that, instead of new and different things, what is already in the market, is just a reflection," Bingham says.
BBC’s Director-General banned the charges and concluded that BBC Radio 3 has a significant increase in living music and illuminating content in its commercial competitors.
"From Radio 3 I learned from classical music what I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to living music and making music is in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey said that the position needs to work more firmly to keep public interest, because the British are more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only hard way in the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport that has been criticized by the BBC channel of entering the commercial channels.
Parliamentarian of the Tory Party Damien Collins criticized the The Voice Skills Race that BBC bought from a Dutch producer from Talpa Media. The price of the sale is estimated at GBP 22 million.
"The programme is not much discussed because it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, BBC1's program, which, as star judges of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced to BBC in a typical way.
In addition, Collins asked the company to look for a hit program from its own booth when it launches a new entertainment series next time.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude the fact that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that the taxpayers’ money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The slow growth of online trade in all times in August – perhaps because of black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by 7%.
Net sales have been statistics since 2000. Last month, growth was slower than ever.
Three years ago, the online trade became stronger with mobile purchase.
Experts believe that November's black Friday can curb shopping desires.
Over ten years, the seizure of the online trade has destroyed many of the UK’s shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is steadily increasing, and the new sales figures show only 7% increase over the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slower throughout the period when online sales were statistics, i.e. since 2000, and online trade grew by only five per cent last year.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is steadily increasing, and the new sales figures show only 7% increase over the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth to the 2000 readings, it is clear that growth will stabilise over time," said IMRG editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy to Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade accelerated three years ago when consumers accepted mobile purchase.
"Thus, more and more people were able to buy online, and many were able to buy in different environments, including from home to home.
Now that mobile acquisition is more moderate, growth can be stabilized."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the theme day to be held on the last Friday of November can cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, the five-fold number of online buyers compared to normal caused many retailers to crash websites.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which makes consumers go after the offers, can control purchase desires during the rest of the period.
According to a survey published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per five pound was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping streets.
Meka is buried in the victims of haulage accidents, the family of Bin Laden responsible
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the major construction company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured by the crash of the lifter.
The bodies were carried in high air when the Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the lifter that fell on the Great Mosque of Mecca
A number of white dressed people had gathered on the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last journey to the Al-Moisem cemetery.
The sad one walked on a pilgrimage site where the crashed builder had only a day earlier entered the mosque roof on the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia demands the family company in Bin Laden's construction sector to be responsible for the accident, where 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of the 29 victims who died in the Greater Mekka accident were transported on the streets.
After the Elevator fell among the dead, Qasim Akram from Bolton, from Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mekka on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were going to start their annual shark hike.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that a shark sanctuary will be held when thousands of people are coming to town for sanctuary.
According to King Salman, Binlad's Group should not have left the lifter's tree up when the lifter was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English service of the News Office did not report in detail. However, according to the English press release, the group's management was prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal, which caused the casting of the lifter at the Greater Mosque garden. Thousands of Muslims will direct their Greater Mosque to the Shark Pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a report on the lifting accident and no group representatives have been sought for the opinion.
The King also accused the group of not complying with the current security rules and working with meteorological experts.
Ten lifters were surrounded by Mekka's Great Mosque as part of Binlad's giant construction project.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi Arabian ruler family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
The former director of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate who had been abandoned by the family in the 1990s.
Only a few days before the pilgrimage of Mekka, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life, took place an accident in the heavy rain and in the heavy wind.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million € (approximately 250 000) to be paid to the families of the victims and permanently disabled persons.
Others injured in an accident will receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, there is cheap Eastern European labour force behind this phenomenon
The British hire the generals of the house more often, says Veronique Laury.
The recommendation has increased the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who are professionals.
More than 200 new Screwfix shops for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, main correspondent, Daily Mail
It is said that the British are transferring the hammaring and painting work of their home to those who come from Eastern Europe.
Nowadays, vasarization and painting skills seem to be scarce.
Nowadays, the British are increasingly recruiting generals in their homes to carry out home nickering work, says B&Q's head of the company.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the retail chain for home rehabilitation needs. Laury says that the phenomenon is based on professional workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at the most price.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for business operators. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more female labour for B&Q stores, because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store make a woman.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, population trends should be taken into account, as today more and more women living alone are renovating their homes.
"Our retailers are still the majority of men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play a significant role in decision-making."
Laury is one of the five women in the British FTSE 100 index, and has also reorganised the company's management group to ensure that male and female leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only of its quality, as 50% of its staff are women, including the Executive Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is important to us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher's business profit and sales figures for six months have declined, although the company was working hardly after the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new stores.
The three-axis government decided to resort to compulsive legislation to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were achieved rather quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other salaried central organisations began to force the country at the same time and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the vast expression of workers.
A lot of people think there's also a sense in it.
Let's ask if it's worth the strikes when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to report that they are not going to participate in the expression but are going to work.
In the old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but the open declaration of wealth would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few ten thousand people from a million professional organisations will not be much time, but it gives the subject of thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's tough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to the heavens.
After years of work seems to be rolling on their own weight, the alliances finally have the right to defend, visiblely and properly, the worker's rights.
Thus, the government may want to capture the role of the Ay movement when membership in the union is perhaps more necessary.
If we are to be of any opinion about the activities of the organisations, it is awkward that Friday’s expression would in some way stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decrease and unemployment will rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Heavy savings for Lappeenranna University: As a goal of 8.5 million savings, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranna will start a savings curve aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of savings, the university will start core staff negotiations with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
Other activities are also aimed at saving two million.
The Yt negotiations are underpinned by the budget for 2016, which anticipates actual activity to be 8.5 million deficits.
This also affects the cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial period, the University will produce a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will be reduced by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the University is around €85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between surgery in mass education and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very important," says Director Anneli Pauli at the University's newsletter.
Prior to the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be new.
Negotiations with trustees will be started next week on Tuesday and they will last for six weeks by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of the Halpabuss company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, says Souter.
Rail traffic is expected to be gradually open to competition.
The first is the nearest traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After short-range traffic, there is a long-distance traffic.
Souter already says he's approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, on the Ministry of Transport, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have indicated their interest in rail transport by at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
Time of interest rate decision by the U.S. Central Bank
On Wednesday and Thursday, the entire world will follow a meeting of the United States Central Bank of Fed, which will decide on the possible increase in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
The fair half of the economics who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now suggest that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current 0 to 0.25 per cent. This is reflected in the survey by Reuters 80 economic scientists.
"It is a historical situation, because the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching the situation in which a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus launch the standardization of interest rates," said Peterson Institute for International Economics, senior researcher Angel Ubide.
The economic situation in the United States has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billions of additional dollars into the balance sheet and has only speeded up little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation that is not as rose.
It has called on the market to be prepared for change, but there is also evidence of the opposite.

The shooter at Delta State University left an apology chip
After shooting her girlfriend in Mississipp on Monday morning – before a colleague was shot later the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologizes for the first murder and hopes to cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
Lamb, teaching geography and social sciences at the Delta State University at Mississippin Gautier, called an emergency number about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot a man.
In an emergency call, Lamb asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is no problem for anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked the name of the caller, but the man didn't tell me.
Nor did Lamb tell you the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, and a message written by Lambi handwritten, saying: "I am very sorry and I hope I can withdraw my action.
I loved Amya, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers away to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before taking his life late on Monday when the police reached him.
The University Director William LaForge told me that there was no knowledge of conflicts between Lambi and Schmidt, but said that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb probably believed that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle drama.
For seven years with Prentiss, Shawn O'Ste described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is shocked.
According to the husband, her daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lambi for three years. He also told me about a woman's dog called Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives on Monday and told them not to go to jail.
When the police reached Lambin Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the forest and took the life of herself.
According to the University's website, Lamb received a doctoral degree in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Celebrated stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (in a picture of his left son with Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that happened has really demanded its tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw page for months because of two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United League fight against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will be disturbed to stay on the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field still this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence area in the bad warlock of Héctor Moreno when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got emergency in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw's got two fractures on his foot, and he's in a hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw's being transferred tomorrow or overmorrow for surgery to Manchester.
A young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 years has experienced a lot of hard experience and now gets hurt after great matches.
Shaw was given oxygen in his dress.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks from two points, he's on the side for half a month and he's not playing in the block phase anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno had little impact on the situation when the red card was not followed by a punishment shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can decide on yourself, but I thought the situation was worth a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a two-foot hollow trunk."
Shaw said, "Thank you for all your messages, and I can't tell you how much I'm messed up.
Add to: Manchester United's Luke Shaw page in the PSV match
The defender of England has a special reason to recover in order to compete at the European Championships in France in June.
"The matter is very bad injury," said PSV's coach.
"In such cases of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The player's intent is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs in the Mexican rows of Van Gaal's balloons until the 2014 World Championships.
"He is very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It is regrettable to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw the ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's backbone."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult a situation like this can be," Moreno said on the SBS6 channel.
"I feel so sorry, I'm very sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent notices before long that the child learns his favorite book almost out.
Except to see David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to appoint his favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the environmental story of Dr. Seussi, published in 1971.
In the text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that it was difficult to choose. "Tarina is funny, touching and creative, and there is a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we haven't noticed before."
It sounds good, except that the next paragraph, in which Cameron is intended to describe the book's run, is a 2012 film version summary, which added new characters and details to supplement the short initial text.
"In the city of Tarville, where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is a merchandise, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dreams by performing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," says the text. In the 1991 version of Dr. Seussin, Theodor Seuss Geiseli, Ted did not have the subject of love.
Unless this is yet doubtful enough, Cameron's text is partly linked to the Lorax project summary of the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a merchandise, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of her dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book's plot would be so strange to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and prepares them for Tarviks in spite of Lorax's resistance. Lorax is a small and thick, wise creature that protects forests.
Probably this kind of, meaningless PR task is entrusted to the assistant, apparently to someone who as a child has not read Lorax 20 times in the pipeline.
The Prime Minister said that the text was probably from Cameron's electoral district office.
SuperCamps did not comment on this, but confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff's handbook.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still hard
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but we have seen the recurrence of the last 3-0 test series of the team selected for the UK tour.
I wouldn't exclude even the chance of a visitor's victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be more unexperienced than the team three years ago, but the hit team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they don't have bad experiences from 2012, just young positives.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spinner, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to leave Adam Lyth is difficult for me to understand as his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best players.
A few 50-point fights would have been held in Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hit Yorkshire more runs.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also commended his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which doesn’t surprise me. He’s primarily a team player.
The question of how long the Test Sloggers will have the opportunity to make their impressions is difficult.
Lyth received seven races – like his predecessor Sam Robson – while Nick Compton received nine.
Compton was the only one who had the chance to take both home and visit.
The only issue of complaining may be that England used Jonathan Trotti first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in perfect condition – but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team and he's a beater that I appreciate to be high.
He is the cricket player of an unknown creator, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the membership of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start a hit with Cook, and then you will get an extra spinner into the game while holding four faster players, and I'm not against the idea.
I can't see the obstacle that the top feeder could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not have gotten a lot of time in his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been a team three-player and it is not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played the first 38 of his trials as the first to replace the game before he started in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is a spare spinner in the team, and based on what I have seen about him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics — an average of 31 points as a beater and 35 as a feeder — and this may be a search shot, but very many spinners have not shown their willingness, and the voters decided to take the young player.
He learns a lot during this game trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a few smart choices for its training staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan beater, Mahela Jayawardenen, as a test advisor may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most hearty men of the species, who brings a lot of experience, because he has played in all kinds of conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the game trip of the white ball and brings, among other things, both energy and mercilessness.
I think he has always seemed to be an appropriate international cricket, whether his role is a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same as before, can be a booster.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's matches, Root got the same opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a match schedule.
And it must be remembered that, like players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit's camp can win if the economy is out of stock 2017
David Cameron's half-way re-negotiation strategy to stay in the UK in the EU is ever deeper, even without the "yes or no" choice of Jeremy for the leadership of the Labour Party or the TUC to spot Europe on a rough Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbys and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is rushing – although not all of them are doing their own thing – and some Member States have been tired of the UK's self-satisfactory agenda, which includes concessions that cause disagreement and harmful amendments to the Treaty which they do not even want.
In Brighton, the TUC's annual Congress decided that they would not entertain themselves in the EU if it would break social security.
We could call it Dave's and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor are hanging in summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-quality people, returning home and telling them they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded UK inside the EU. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we no longer care whether we are staying or leaving.
Angela Merkel, the reasonable federal chancellor of Germany is a ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it becomes ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande, France, is facing a re-election or a successor's selection in 2017.
His power is swaying, too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist right-wing government, in Spain again a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them hiking to help selfie bretches, who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, nor do they want it because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may plan to deliberately throw insignificant comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the United Kingdom's 2017 referendum campaign, which seeks to enforce the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The new negotiations were organized." "Nothing left in the hands of Britain about re-negotiations."
The Europeans know how the British press catches and how the EU-sceptical oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Bennin, which resulted in 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Some people may remotely remember Boris Johnson, a veinous euro-possible person who became known as our "EU direct banana correspondent" at the beginning of the 1990s in Brussels.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax-circling, phone hacking and seemingly temporary socks, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about them very much the same, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you need to spread bananas into a twist so that gorilla wouldn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was the most blasphemed of Blair in opposition to the referendum, and Blair was granted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected. When France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in the 2005 referendum, Blair was handy.
The press never forgives him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in Westminster on Monday. I told her that she had no more time to waste on me.
It may take some time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating with the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on a BBC sofa on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we kindly call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in the reformed EU.
Most of the people outside Ukipin and Tory are likely to be able to respond to this affirmatively.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennite" Benn told on radio and television this week when his internal patrol boy tried not to admit that it was a bad bet of Corbyn to appoint the harsh John McDonnell as the shadow State Minister of Finance.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father had difficulty being disloyal to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU under "all circumstances" and McDonnel did not say that to his colleagues and members of the sub-study at a private meeting on Monday night.
If Corby wanted to care about the sucking picture, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The messager is important during the 24/7 period, especially in the social media discipline, where paranoia and fraud are involved.
Cameron does not have to be given a free passport with regard to the EU, so that he could see Labour's support as a self-evidence in the referendum, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks this.
The equation of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership is suitable for a bennite island economy and the past against capitalism, which no longer belongs only to a narrow circle of left-wing controversies, for which the idea of combining similarity is a key subject in doctrinal bias.
Equivotion has also been seen with respect to NATO, and Tom Watson is inconspicuous in the fact that Corby did not campaign for the departure, and foreign diplomats have to try to clarify the situation in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, they have suspicious voters, and why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be for nothing?
The United States has already quite disappointed the British's bad military presentation in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the early operations of the Tory government, which I was reminded of during the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticised the British Authority’s opinions on electric cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a state-funded institution that smoking of electricity cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were born at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented by the Public Health Authority (PHE) in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal on electric cigarettes.
The PHE described its report last month as a "reversible and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and raised the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal's chapter took the "remarkable heifer base" on which the most important conclusion of the PHE is based.
In addition, two researchers at BMJ have considered whether the claims have been established for "call or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool have stated: "The basic presumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the public expects that the PHE's claim that "the current best estimate suggests that electricity cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed research results analysis and modelling.
The claim is based on one 12-person meeting, which was convened to develop a multi-purpose decision analysis model (MCDA). The model wanted to harmonise the participants' views on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKee and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, which, according to sources, was financed by British American Tobacco (BAT) by the CEO.
In addition, the Executive Director indicated in the Sustainable Action Report that he supported BAT public health activities.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting granted funding from the electricity cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by the participant.
The selection criteria for the panel have not been studied, but several known electric cigarette supporters, some of whom grant their participation as an industrial funder, are included.
However, some of the participants are not familiar with their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco representative of the PHE.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no undeniable evidence of the harmfulness of the products with regard to a large number of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, connections or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided that electric cigarettes can promote smoking by children or non-smoking. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to the Director for Health and Welfare of the PHE, Professor Kevin Fenton, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, electricity cigarettes are much less harmful than traditional smoking.
Each of the people who smoked through life dies because of tobacco dependence.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are less than the risks of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be investigated more closely.
The PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not show, particularly in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom there are nearly 80,000 deaths in connection with smoking every year, and smoking costs for public health care of two billion pounds per year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly show the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a riskless alternative, but that their adverse effects are a fraction of the adverse effects of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, the leader of Channel 4, has stated that BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand about the hit series, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for the production of programs that other television stations do not.
He criticised BBC’s likely presentation of smaller audience programmes at the same time as large audiences of competitors, and for example on the BBC4 channel.
When BBC's CEO Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to work with BBC for six years without results.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC will buy formats and send programs that would clearly be part of a competitive channel's software," Johnson told the House's High Committee on Communications, which explained the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a radio fee, which I do not necessarily think is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC will send The Voice to the best time to watch, because it wants the best possible support in the future.
If any other channel doesn't worry about the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could be financed without support," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders another, although it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand about it.
I don't understand how this serves the broadcasting service.
I don't think these would be a loss for BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in the lead of Channel 4 2004–2010. He thinks BBC gets good audiences because the company works with ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to Tony Ball, the former Sky boss, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programmes for BBC's niche audience are shown on the BBC4 channel, where viewers can't most of them be measured, but they are in line with their intentions. "BBC can say, in defending hypocritical missions, they've made four billion pounds of radio charges, but they've done special programs that no one looked at."
"BBC presents them as times when no one ever sees them."
With regard to radio charges, Johnson said: "I challenge you to look for another system that is as old as anyone gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is cheap, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if BBC isn't exactly looking at."
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also stated his own views in the committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, BBC's current offer is hardly educational – 1 per cent on television and 0.1 per cent on radio. He adds that BBC should learn from Australia's and Canada's broadcasters and give the mission a new faith: "inform, illuminate and entertain".
With regard to the question of cooperation, Elstein proposes that BBC be able to increase transmissions of events, such as the Proms Festival, which was sent only a fraction of the concerts last year. "BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels so that the entire supply is also available online," he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle mad changes its direction when they are directed with ultrasound.
Researchers have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small pendulums change their direction when they are directed by ultrasounds with a frequency above the ear area of the human ear.
The sound waves activate movable nerve cells that have been genetically modified with a transport film that reacts to ultrasound.
Add to the topic: Researchers follow brain activity through light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics), using ultrasound for the activation of brain, heart and muscle cells with an stimulus outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher of Salk Instutes in California, told Guardian that one day the method could replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s symptoms, which stimulates the brain by electric pulses.
The sukkulamados do not normally react to ultrasound. Chalasani found that the worms, however, begin to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves that move into worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are part of worm cell cells.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, sound waves make these ion channels open and activate cells they are attached to.
In order to control the squads with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically converted the worms so that some of their movement-driven nerves showed up TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to converted mats, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and moved to mats, leaving the signal in the nerve cell.
The method is a little similar to optogenetics, which must be a converting tool to enable researchers to activate nerve cells through light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brains under study using photofibres. Low frequency ultrasounds instead easily pass through the cell, so ultrasound can be driven through the brain through the skull.
"We believe that genetic and viral treatment will allow momentaneous exposure of human nerve cells to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment — at your home door!
Advertising is a shame on British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's anti-weapon show video.
Heavy killer missiles!
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Bombs!
Remotes that cause intolerable pain but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertisement of the world's largest arms fair is parodie. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to raise the British government's attempt to sell weapons to the repressive governments at the DSEI (Defense Security and Equipment International) fair held at the ExCel Fair in London in Docklands.

Bus stops and subway cars also run out of posters that require another look.
"Important notice: do you move by the metro 15-18.9.?" The notice resembles the notices of the London metro, which is a picture of the tanker at the other side of the metro line.
"In September, a bunch of gun dealers arrive in Dockland, and customers are asked for help to cancel the guns."
Three hundred posters have made artists whose work was presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
Collectively named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound advertising hacker package with six keys to access about a third of the world bus stops advertising bills.
Transport for London doesn't julistevandalism is laughing.
One of the Special Patrol Group's collective jokes.
According to Cruel Designs curator and Essex University lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work outside the galleries to the public.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world, so many move to work with protesters.
One of the anti-weapon posters greets public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times over a day. It has been designed without compensation advertising office VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the repeaters have also done their work without compensation.
VCCP's artistic director, Matt Lever, missed the absence of the fair and the empty encounter in the ExCeL event calendar. He said: "Let's give them a campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They tried to tire of a more realistic, ambiguous corporate video, but bright colors and animation bring more attention."
"They have done great work and helped us to raise the fair where illegal torture equipment is traded," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not sold illegally at our home door."
However, the most creative antia of the arms fairs is presented in the exhibition rooms themselves in ExCeL, where samplers use great circular expressions for their trade.
In its press release, Saab announced the United States Army's order for the "dragable AT4CS RS."
The product includes "a specially designed battle point, which effectively enters directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student housing
I moved to a student apartment 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barets and moral relativism. Only now I remember the crowded smiles I irritated, and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important lessons I can merge into eight simple rules.
The move to a place of residence is the most slight experience and the worst is shocking.
The situation starts easy to cheer: you tell everyone where you are, whether you liked the mid-year and why you like Corbyn and why you don't "hate or love Marmite, because it's just a spice, a shark, I'm in my room."
You can take some breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other things.
Asking guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your hips were in the air and these people shared the triggers.
Give the rest room.
Your own rooms often serve as drinks, cinemas and common accommodations, but your room is also a place where you dress, from underwear.
Add to the topic: Do not even imagine combining relationships with university studies
Introvert University is a hard place
The room should be a tranquillization place, but many residential homes form a social culture where they move from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture may be a nightmare for a person who needs a place of return.
It is not possible in this environment to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating with you."
Try to see if one of your fellow students is tired of social interaction. Maybe you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own student apartment there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant that he was welcome inside.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get friends by baking.
You start your studies properly when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-year-old, a little strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I bake you something small.
Homemade delicacies are a great way to get new friends.
Your fellow students have to talk to you, and thanks to a tasteful surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakery skills from you.
If you serve unhappy meals, sugar and fat-clicked cooks, others probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
The dishing of food is also a general breach of student housing conditions.
Takeing another chicken is, of course, stealing, but can his tea drop a box from someone else's milk cloth?
Always make sure the milk container is on the owner.
Probably you will get permission, even if the milk quote would be a juppie for the owner of the container.
I understand very well that it is annoying if someone stabbed something from you, but try to handle the situation as adultly as possible — unlike my own student friend who lured the laundry to his milk as a punishment for milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't squeeze when others try to sleep or squeeze.
Not only because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that every hole for another is digging...
In my own apartment, one girl asked the guest in the room to set the music to a lower level, for it was three in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally was quiet in the neighboring room, the girl allowed the neighbor to sleep for two hours. She went to the test for three hours, left the music to crack in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would move to the same place?
Wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your fellow student would be your wife, you would start dating, divorced, and had to see her every day, and you would lose the right to meet her with your fellow friends?
Of course, your heart wants what you want. If a student friend isn't the only right one, try to control the desire.
If you notice at a moment of joy that someone has forgotten his keys in a room that has not been locked, the limit of temptation and temptation is more disturbing than you might think.
Good joke's funny, but it's the one that's gonna be okay in a minute.
Hiding something may be a valuable and fun teaching, but no room should be confused with a toothpane and a sampola.
The door of the second room can lock and drop the keys into a water glass to put in a freezer, but do not attach any items on the roof with a blue stopping device a few times more.
To the residence of foreign students racist attack on the Kite - a house designed as a reception centre was inserted in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out at the campus of foreign students at Kite in North Carolina.
Unlike the police mentioned earlier, this is not the accommodation facilities for minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping mats of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Kiteen Evangelical People's University.
The University's housing windows and walls were scratched with racist marks, such as hackers, and a metallic object had been thrown through one accommodation window, says East Finland's police.
According to Lukas, the responsible teacher for the training of young people in social security at the University was estimated to have 10 people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The University has hosted people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in the confused building have a-statements.
Some are studying at adult base school, some are in professional studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland.
East Finland's police investigate the attack as a damage and a breach of home peace.
According to Lukas, a briefing was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had more than a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
According to the Lukas, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The authors are suspected that at least three men had been on the move with a white passenger car.
I think this is the end of the youth's weekend, since this topic has now been on the top.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, a hospital with a planned reception centre.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about this on his website on Tuesday night.
In the hospital wall was drawn a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a crime report to the police.
Details 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information from the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state stops the Y train for the Karjah. Passengers close to them, "heavy idiots."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karjama ceases to travel in March.
The news threw passengers on the main railway station in Helsinki who climbed the train early in the evening.
In particular, the downturn strikes the blessings, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's pretty stupid, because the number of people is growing all the time, and people working need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is coming to the capital even if it's a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
The position of Purola in Lake and Nuppulinna in Tuusula is out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the following contract period.
The contract period varies over the year and the routes can be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement finalising in autumn will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a Siuntio, believes that the state train operator is a short-sighted operation.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there's a repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-racesporians and blessings, because it is fast and passes several stations.
In the Espoola Annina Pöyry, on the train, the fate of those traveling beyond the city area was horrified.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain in the Y train.
There's a little relief in the promise.
A new train connection, which replaces the Y-train in the region of the region of Helsinki (HSL), will probably be coming to the beach, i.e. to the church number.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million per year, the Ministry certainly has much more.
The R line coming on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, the number of train mountains in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Veuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened into the Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train mountains are decreasing on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made at the time of termination, with a total of approximately nine million trips purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Timeliness of Capital: "Marx should be familiarized"
The crisis in the world economy has raised Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work published in 1867-1894, writes the topic of Marx's capital, known as the former president of the SKP, in the book today published by Yrjö Hakanen.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and invasion in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginative capital have proved surprisingly far-reaching.
The bookwriter's list of books based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakaska is also available as Professor of the Aalto University, renowned economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is the current "now and forever".
However, the former CEO of the Department of Economic Research and the Department of Economic Affairs is not Marxist, is it?
Not at least.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not think Marxi is an actual economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, societal sciences have been differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary tutor.
"Usually, the idea is that the history of the idea tells us about the false opinions of the dead men," Korkman starts.
True, Marx's prophecies went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the original spirit of capitalism too far, Korkman thinks.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"Most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technological transformation," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx will not be helpful.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Yet Marxi is in the interest of Korkman.
"In the 1970s, Marxi could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maesians and Trotskyans and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more versatile and Marxi can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should be acquainted with Marx's thought world - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports the AFP news office.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamil clubs for war crimes.
In Sri Lanka's civil war, at least 100,000 people are estimated to die.
There's no exact information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as the UN report requires.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be victims as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of imposing sides and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN Court because of foreign judges.
In England's yo experiment, the social media were punctuated
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language in the high school writings of the autumn, which was mostly English.
More than 16 000 students were tested in England's skills.
In the experiment, it could have been written about social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the written 150-250 words in English could be shown to the user of the online magazine's advice palette.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He was asked how parents should look at things for young people as well.
A total of four subjects were to be selected.
"It was the most difficult of them," evaluated the third topic in Porvoo at Swedish-swedish high school lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
Lybeck said the fourth subject was quite nice again.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment "a bit normal".
In Finnish or Swedish, the English experiment allowed questions to be answered on texts that, for example, benefit from the adaptation of the summer campus to climate change and the treatment of large masses of information.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The writings of the autumn continue on Friday, and then the test of another domestic or Swedish or Finnish.
At high school, the test is conducted normally, i.e. the statement of the employees does not affect it.
The University Board of Apprentices urges the testers to search for appropriate connections in time to allow them to attend the trial.
Additional time can also be given if it can be shown that the delay was not due to its own carelessness.
Orula was robbed by a gun.
On Wednesday morning, the shop in the Belle District was robbed in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was dressed with dark clothes and a face covering the command.
He's a normal man and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a gun and got a small amount of money to catch.
It's being investigated as a gross robbery.
Police reserves the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support teams from other countries of Finland
The statement of opposition to the government's surgery decisions will be blocked on Friday in central Helsinki, predicts the police.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the Associations of SAK, Akava and STTK will meet on the Railway Road at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to participate in the expression of mind.
In turn, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothness of the gigantic expression.
Roads leading to the railroad are closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30-14 a.m.
Only alarm vehicles are left in the area.
From the direction of the hakaniemi, the traffic is cut off from the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Lieutenant Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it looks like it's enough.
I'm not going to take a stand on the police's work fights.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The police don't tell you exactly what they're doing.
"Something is coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police urge to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic package extends from Hakaniemi level to its nuclear centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the evening.
There are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki with protesters from other countries.
They're not allowed to go to the Iron Road.
The buses are basically staying a little far away.
The rest of the journey must then walk to the protest site," Kujala says.
The opinion also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, this is a positive part.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large people's meetings, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the statement have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy in Helsinki.
The police expect the expression to be calm.
People are usually working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," Kujala says.
Local expressions will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's expression is in many ways exceptional, do you remember these strikes and expressions?
The big expression of the professions organized on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen, Professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder that the ay business is protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise hands in front of the government, the Blue says.
The very right-wing government has struck the core points of the Finnish corporacy tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard extracts are intrusive in contract law.
This is a lot of features of the fact that the ay business is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not at all have the support of all employees for the expressions of the mind on Friday.
The new one is now the sharp division that is created by the expression of mind among those whose ay-business would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed persons from different parts of Finland showed their views at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday’s expression, it could be a gigantic demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorston, Sininen says, in 1993.
The Murrostorstai, organized in the middle of the deepest depression, gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The Government of Esko Ahon (Central) compensates from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the Employee Organisations had never been as bad as they were during the Mayorship Board of Aho.
Now between the government and the Ay movement may still be worse than in Murrostorst.
In addition, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power, says Siisinen.
The current government coalition is still in such an interesting way that it is so tightly right, despite the speeches of the Finnish fundamentals.
There were some elements of the old labour movement at the time of the rod.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The message also stops public transport and possibly closes homes and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive undivided support from the payees, it can become the largest for years.
Around 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're put on the edge.
Traditionally, the Finnish Ay movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have been tightened over the past few years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
Mental displayers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of expression changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes on, among other things, pilots and pilots.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
There were 70,000 metal men involved in the metal men's lay.
The strike was suspended after seven weeks of the strike, on the basis of a proposal from the Conciliation Board.
Metal men got a 16% increase in wages.
The electricity blow in spring 1977 took 49 days and caused electricity breakouts all over the country.
Murder Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed, met before the Parliament House to show their views on the work.
Firefighters striked three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were forced into egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia to teach, the EU to stop," was one of the slogans.
To Espa, farmers squeezed tons of snow.
The EU Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn the breweries in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been in a strike in 1983.
Some deaths occurred during the strike during the 1995 strike.
Tehy threatened by the strike and the dismissal of nurses in 2007.
In the end, the threat of mass decommissioning accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors striked in 2001
"The doctors in the strike - forced," was the slogan of the striker doctors in 2001.
The attack of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a vigorous discussion on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for study support from the Senate to the Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
Central Crime Police finds the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian Police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Crime Police in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim near the German border.
There is no information on whether the truck was possibly on the way to Finland.
All those in the cold truck were in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the event site in Austria, reports Chief Commander Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, the fate of other refugees traveling on the truck rides in Austria was worse.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died apparently by suffocation.
According to the Public Radio, on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish stock company.
The company operates, among other things, a restaurant business and its CEO is an alien background, a man about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
Fluchting Captain, former drug currior and a smuggling businessman, the story of five smugglers
The king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the stylish missionary, and the taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people carry out human trafficking transport to the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Office appears in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the lobsters of human smuggling, present conclusions and present smugglers on the different portal of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them away from your thoughts right away.
Church Islands in the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for summer holidays.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also excellently suited for smuggling, as it is only 120 kilometres away from the island of Lampedusa, Italy.
For this comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain burning in the chain, and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with blue, ten meters of wood boats hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, 40 people will be able to fill it.
For one trip, Emir earns about EUR 8 000 after the expenses.
Emir has five helpers who are looking for him for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrests.
After that, the situation calmed up until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the continent to Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as you can see good.
Food is given so that customers will just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer ends with the money, it's their problem.
They're going to the waters with the lights they can turn off at midnight.
The first night you drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and in 20 meters high waves passengers cry and vomit.
At destination, the human child has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is leaving for the return journey.
Emir wants him to be scared.
That's why he's hitting his clients and at least claiming to beat the hangers to death.
He says in the book that when the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I loved customers one by the neck and threw them over the edge," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
He said his peasants had to abuse this.
I'm gonna kick them out of your mind right now.
We need to show them who's in charge.
Normal taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. The starter engine is pulling the last ones, and anyway, it's seen the best of his days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that a taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to the south.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly lodged.
Men traveling in forests surrounded by the centre without their family will be accommodated in tents, booths and abandoned cars, which anyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who have not submitted an asylum application for Serbia for reasons or for others.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walks in difficult land, often in mountain areas and darkness.
Finally, when people arrive in the Bogovaða region, at the main point of human smuggling, they are dying.
The Cypriots of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their things once and that's enough," Gora praises.
He says the Africans are trying to tinch.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
You silly bastard's gonna be silly all the way.
First, it will be agreed at a price of 300 euros, then it will fall to 200 and finally offer 150 euros.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than anyone else and he's only going to charge 50 euros per person to the Hungarian border.
It's a trip of 300 miles, most of it is comfortable on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a big sum for the smuggler, but a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport immigrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his cyans to a mile away from the border.
Then he's showing his clients the right direction, and he's sweeping away.
The work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers fled from Congo, as well as a small centre that helps Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Messenger runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and takes care that the white necklace rubber tape is stylishly gripped under the lower necklace of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedex, his car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the client will call from one of the five phone numbers of the Messenger.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money in a whisper and bend among cross-border merchants.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seekers or refugees to the Ugandan authorities, it is necessary to tell them that there are, for example, war areas in North Kivu, and that they have been forced to escape violence in their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the Messenger will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old identity certificate will be destroyed and the replacement will be acquired.
It helps the missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police.
The client will then be sent to the same place where true asylum seekers go: the asylum search procedure, to NGOs, finally to UNHCR.
The missionary feels bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He bills for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, handling documents to the humanitarian organisation about EUR 150 and moving, for example, to one European country, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice creams
Tom's a smuggler, a former drug dealer.
Fourty Irish days are taking place on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to load people to trucks traveling to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver and tens of truck drivers who don't necessarily even know they're in a human traffic business.
In the night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people from some of Calais's center.
They're driving the A26 motorway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would be sent to prison directly from organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom runs with customers over the motorways to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing through the channel to the British.
Tom's picking up a suitable truck... must make sure that it's on his way to England, and not to Holland, and cut off the cover guard.
It needs to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the chauffeur is involved in the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into aluminum foil, the same as the kitchen wraps around the baker or oven potato.
It's supposed to stop the police's heat scanner from seeing a hidden person.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that he didn't drive any flashers before Britain at least.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human traffickers.
The turkish turkist has been called a champion of marketing and an uncontested king of illegal Mediterranean landings, who governs sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands money.
One of the new methods is luxury ship cheating: Turkish ports are rented for a few days to bring American or European families to tourist crossroads.
In fact, the ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans who are transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe for a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until they have the time to leave.
People are smelting into minibuses and driving somewhere to the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, we need to get on the ship quickly.
Passengers must hide the entire journey under the deck.
The sea reserve can only observe how deep the ship swims, because other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the fewer passengers go out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury ship trip after the expenses.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other minors to handle their work for themselves.
During the summer, transport is organised for at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is supposed to have purchased the land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
The American Olympic Runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a racer of 1,500 meters three times in the Olympics, has raised attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells about the end of his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in perfect condition and ran in the brushes for the second best time.
But in the final, he was panicked.
He flew to the top right at the beginning and defended his leadership with a earthly run.
However, 150 meters before the finish, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like I was an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the line of painting, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bipolar disorder.
His brother, Dan, had committed suicide a year before the Sydney races, and he himself felt enormous pressures on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
He also appealed to his husband to accept his activities.
The Favour Hamilton taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me he's using the money for luxury life.
One of the explanations made by Favor Hamilton to become a prostitute was that he also needed adrenaline sticks similar to those he had received in competition in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The twin life of the former star runner appeared at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton took part in the Olympics of Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters in the world’s first statistical year of 3.57,40, but remained last at the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the federation put the Norwegian ski flower in the discipline:
The Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of suitability in at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian skiing union have turned around all summer and autumn, like last year, the sporting agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for multiple world champions and Olympic winners.
The result of the dispute decided to exclude Northug from the coming World Cup.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski flower under control.
"Thank you for showing your backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski union and Northug is about money.
Apparently Northug would like to be part of the season of the country team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also takes care of future generations and does not give one athlete in solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he assured that he wanted to play in the Norwegian colours in the World Cup next season, as well as then in the World Cups and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM-millions in his career, of which two are gold.
Last winter, he was involved in the team that won the gold of message in Falun.
The day of the shielding of the translators is also spent in the North
On the day of the shield of 25 September, temptations will be held in different restaurants and stores for which the Shield of the Pastors has been awarded.
Today's goal is to highlight Finland's high-level food skills and to lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital region, but that high-quality restaurants that are audited and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
International attention from the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of the awareness of the conditions and organisation.
The day will be held on the ground in Vaasa, a restaurant in Fondis and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant will participate in the day of shielding.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has therefore been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events that will be held during the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Indicted to the Chancellor on the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish the refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava equipment currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the Critical Infrastructure of the Crisis continues to be permanently located in the region, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, Finland Erillisnät Oy.
The Kauhajoki magazine states that the placement of a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have an interest in the area of the former Airport School and in connection with the airport, whose impact has not also been investigated during the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The case states that for the last two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of air training and on the arrival of any foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (p.) and Head of Office of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person notes to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former equipment area is wrong.
The City Hall of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Soja: the situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic region
Administration means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those present here, so it comments on the journalists in the evening after having met the presidents of all Parliamentary parties in their official residence in Mäntymi.
According to the President, the concern about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it worthwhile that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially traditional issues.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to the Societ, the situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic region.
It is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia will be able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to affect the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the societary, the NATO issue was also ignored in the debates.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Congratulations closes the streets of the city of Helsinki
The demonstration to be held on Friday will close the streets in the centre of Helsinki.
The police tell us that the streets leading to the Railway Road are closed from cars around 9:30-14.
From the direction of the Mannerheimins, cars are not allowed to go to Mine Street, Postgata, and Työolönlahdengata towards the railway station.
From the Union Street Hakaniemi direction, transport is directed to the Union Street on the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and Rail Drivers throughout Friday in the mindlight
Metro and tram drivers will participate in the morning morning and night traffic on Friday.
The railway and subway staff association told the STT this evening.
Most of the Alki is closed for two hours, including posts closed
Friday’s mindset also causes disturbances in Post’s services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of day mail.
Most of the mail service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Red Cross of Finland is handled despite the fall.
Food transport as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also sought to be handled.
Status information on services can be found on the Post website.

Pam has advised his employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Mr Pam has also called on daily traders to participate in the professional opinion.
SOK's and Kesko's representatives tell Helsinki's News that the stores are aimed at keeping open, if necessary, with the superiors.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual transactions.
Helsingin day care homes partially closed
Helsingin day-care facilities do not work fully on Friday, informs the Helsinki Early Education Agency.
As a result of professional organisations’ mentality, day care may be concentrated on certain day care homes and no club activities in day care and playgrounds are organised.
Environmental day care and groups of disabled people and children with multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for disabled and autistic students are normally organised.
The Early Education Agency promises to inform more about changes in the activities tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipila, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a direct channel of speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not stay for the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will become.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be communicated in the future on the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as a channel, let's see.
Now this channel is used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipila, the situation of Finland's economy is to a serious extent that it requires a television and radio speech to be held to citizens.
This set of issues, on which we are now talking, is rather complex and requires longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 p.m. on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also look at it at Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's television speech will not tell us about a more general reversal of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more closely in their own hands and to refuse public debate on questions?, says Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
Remembers Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
On behalf of the democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be related to each other.
Heavenen understands that commercial media are enraged by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not communication issues in democracy.
The role of media representatives is, in terms of definition, to ensure that policymakers are not taken as a result.
It's a big risk for Sipile.
In his speech, Sipila should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations placed on the speech.
Is there more that we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or to say something new?
Heavenen says that if there is only more the same old one in the permit, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this context, it is common to take a risk in the sense that it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a mediator for politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or with the general line.
Slim Bet
In the coming speech of Sipila, it is also important that the media researcher stresses what the Prime Minister does not say.
Tonight we need to look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where no, says research coordinator Heikki Kuutti at Jyväskylä University.
According to the sixth, the TV speech is a clever bet from Sipil, because this way this can bring out its own view without the sorrow.
This will bring a large audience without a journalist's filter, unlike at the press conference, where journalists can put critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interpret something wrong about the speech, because there are no precise questions to be raised.
It's very important to see how Sipilä performs on the TV. It's like sweat casts, it's gonna shake his hands.
He compares Sipil with the father figure that now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to put it up well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would inform about something, because in this case a person is like talking directly to another person.
Such (US President Barack) Obama and partners regularly practice this type of activity.
Very Exceptional
Politician Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens is really exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to make the Finnish people sympathetic with the extortions ahead.
Employee organisations will organise a demonstration on Friday and strike against government action.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, said that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that we could also discuss the speech.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (Sd.), again announces that he is challenging the dialogue with Sipila.
We don't have time for monologists now.
It's about six months from the elections.
You can't hide in the end, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on escape has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition at the time of his discovery.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the case for Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later at night, he couldn't be contacted.
My father thanks all the people who have been looking for help.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
The Finnish UFC star disappointed young people with violence: You get anger
The Kurdish free fighter Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to immigrant backgrounds for young people.
Makwan Amirkhani had a strong speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me he received a message calling for an Instagram account.
There are videos downloaded on the account where young people fight with the most violent grips.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the wildness of young people.
A 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick down the ground, sit on the other, and hit unseenly without thinking about these consequences when you make these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinose, fighting videos have been downloaded to social media by both immigrants and young people in the Finnish community.
That's the fact that you're fighting on the street.
You make the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite awkward.
A little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be visitors here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are ever subjected to racism, you may blame yourself for it.
Now, think a few times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is making contributions to racism.
You'll have to make such an aggression that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and that's what you're going to do, you won't make them better, Amirkhanini decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly tells Twitter that on Monday, the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Previously on Wednesday, the STTK informed the Government of its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity sector required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Mr Akavan President, Mr Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require SAK's largest payroll organisation to soften its previous position.
SAK President Lauri Lyly, for his part, commented briefly on this on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and the need for agreements between active parties instead of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that the proposal by the Government of Prime Minister Sipila for a social agreement was not suitable for SAK.
In the past, Sipilä discontinued the negotiations on the Social Agreement, when SAK did not agree to commit itself to the target of the 5% productivity segment.
Comment: The big-minded protest threatens to get close to it, "I think it's a little funny to get a fist."
It feels a little funny to get a box if there's already a reconciliation paper in the pocket, writes Pekka Tiinane.
The atmosphere varies in the payroll camp.
Is it supposed to call the government to revoke or to agree with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders of SAK blasted holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to get caught.
The mud spread to the acavals, too.
The OAJ was threatened by the closure of schools and nurseries.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was chaired by the STTK.
He said that he had been in contact with the government and drafted an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) for a 5% productivity reduction.
The Akava President Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately urged him to announce that his agreement paper is already ready.
At first, SAK's office did not belong to a nutshell.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
However, Lyly finally announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would seek solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint presentation of employees, SAK should be inclined to accept a 5 % productivity target.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of Palola, director Jukka Ihanus, responsible for the social impact of the STTK, was formerly the Special Assistant of Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhase and Mari Kiviniemi.
So Palola characterised that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Incidentally or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit away from Finland's seizures, whose sparkling image is disrupted by the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I think it's a little funny to get a box if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not be repeated"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
The President of the Russian Duma Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the September Session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July celebration meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to come to the meeting - a matter which the President referred to as a reminder of the journalists.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This shouldn't happen again, Naryshkin insisted on Interfax's news office.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the criticism of Naryshkin was addressed to the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pierce Finland with praise and thanks to Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met the Ilkka Kanervan (kok) in the Ulan Bator meeting, which, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff-tick: "Targets tight"
Tappa and Castle continue today in Hakametsa bull days when both are in fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamwald there are no real paintings.
Yesterday, the killer went to Kuopio to pick up the 3-2 win on KalPa.
The rise was male, because last season's silver group was the worst of two goals' loss.
The lock Tuesday was more mellitus.
The spacemen's catch tactically started Blues' guest was round zero point, and the loss readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any plays similar to last year, Lock attacker Janne Lahti predicted positions on the company's pages.
The kill has formed a pretty playoff nightmare for the Romanians.
For in the last two seasons, the killer has just dropped in the middle of the Luko final series.
At both times, a decisive seventh game has been required for the solution.
Last season The Lås took the series to the break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three sides and passed.
There are no significant changes in the groups' compositions, except for goalkeepers.
We're gonna have to get both of the cassas who have rejected them yesterday, and they're getting a smiling shift today.
On the painting of the killer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the locks, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: In progress with a sad play
The sports director Toivola manuscripted an inappropriate follow-up to the main coach Rail Hall, written by Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone manuscripted the Rocky film, in which he himself played the main part.
The submariner set up a sensational campaign for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola manuscripted a restless ash story in Por.
The nameless and wooden breeze went forward to the 2006 SM finals as a surprise for everyone.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough basin respondents like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop games, players colored their heads red and cut the iroceses.
Hopeful became a blonde.
A great TV reporter JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Asses took a won silver.
Hopevola was one of the heroes.
The manuscript Toivola believes that this season's novelty works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who is the leader of the sporting activities has built a flea to the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have smuggled guys in a trunk like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than boiling.
Hopevola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Eisenkallio.
Karri Stone has crucified the Iron Hall Sean Connery.
In Toivola's rocky, the iron coat is as silly as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing else in the Iron Hall than Rocky's favorite name.
The game philosophy of the iron coil does not include cruise and small-sweeping.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's different to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garret Stafford took Tapparan Jere Karjala to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Curtain put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I do not accept such a game, nor does it belong to the ashes, the hot-handed Eisenkallio threw after the game to the Satakunta People.
The team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and elevators.
There are no key men in the best gaming age.
No wonder the main coach has complained about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Eisenkallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, Iron Callio answered diplomaticly.
Underneath the surface, let's go.
The 1953 Iron Curtain is well-knownly interested in moving to Toivola's place as a sports manager.
The men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance in the three leagues of the season has just as many losses on the score of 1-6.
Hopevolan would not have been in favour of writing a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband at Tuukan's teenage age, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of her husband.
Yes, in the movie, I'll play my husband's friend's mother.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temone laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bassador and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga plays for the first time in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the early years of the Apulana film, you made us a beautiful movie, a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppas and supports his son, although his father Risto (presenting Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have known my real example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to present the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka that he trusted me.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have been very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, messed up.
The chip has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, it also understands that the drama is a drama and the truth may need to be coloured a little bit.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulana would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 1990s, there was a depression, and it was really bad.
It was a pretty small probability that someone really succeeded, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me he had heard a lot from Tuuka about this young one before film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the name of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s infamous chess story.
Olga was a regular and nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have loved him secretly.
Olga says he's been working so much with Tuuka over the last 10 years that a big joint project is not scared.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production group goes to Heinola for a month.
However, because of their little children, the couple in Iti is often planning to drive home for night, because the distance is not too long.
We're gonna take the whole Heinola for a month.
They have taken us really warmly, just asked what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to be Finland's hottest play movie
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film directed by Timo Bergensola is EUR 17 million.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Bergensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifie film Iron Sky's follow-up, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most calmest of all times in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
The title of the oldest film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is under way will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of more than EUR 100 million.
The film film produced by Timo Bergensola and Tero Kaukomaa begins in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Bergensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scared.
I've been sick of relaxing!
I'm so relaxed with the manuscript, because I know exactly what kind of movie I'm supposed to be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more enthusiastic, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he tells Iltalehti.
Initially, the budget of the film was 8-10 million, but the budget also increased as the manuscript evolved.
It's a big budget, but it's a big drill.
However, 100 million people would have to penetrate the film because each angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything's turned so tight that there's no looseness.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a bundle financing campaign and a bundle loan with an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined according to demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years later, the company will repay the loan.
The film shows Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trend sets have recently decorated large logos.
Still some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in the word.
The advertising of a hop or T-shirt was seen as a junt.
But times change.
Sport has become the right fashion megatrend, and as well old, familiar sports labels such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness of the wavebrush.
And as so often before, the funny and trendy limit is bleaching: if something is already right, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came a norm core trend, i.e. a fashion of style, in which trends were surprised by the most boring basic clothing as a means of separating from the mass.
Now we put on the grey base collage instead of the already buried netshirt on the bottom of the locker, in front of which the manufacturer's logo is beautiful.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logs, for example, Adidas' identifiable rail networkers, the favorite team game shirts and the New York Yankees lips have made a return to the repentance.
So now the Calvin Klein logos of the bastards are a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the chest of Versace’s causal bags makes it clear what a significant requirement is.
Would you be ready to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I wasn't stuck in the tank lock for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 presented Russian war industry products.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency has had to remove the large Zotovia tank hole for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to be sniffing the pansar vehicle's bone in quite good atmospheres and not at least on the basis of their pictures, it's not about stucking or annoying.
That's so stupid.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into a battle tank, but it was a bump tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel, I've been serving at Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and I came out peacefully, Zotov said to Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
In the exhibition, Zotov explained to the Russian army television channel that he admired Russia's new technology because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the cars, and I admired our technology.
And I came out through the jar, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all tank tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called a reporter who wrote it stupid.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm long and rotten, but anything that I'd been stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotovi’s words are supported by the fact that no photograph of alleged jail has been published, even though there were a total of 50,000 people in the exhibition during a few days.
The claim that Zotovi was caught started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told to rip out of the tank lock when trying to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story where the organizers of the exhibition reported their own view of the event.
Everyone's just used to the soldiers jumping out of panzered vehicles quickly.
But the MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way he sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

A Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilän mine has been leaked.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment pool.
According to the company, measures to remedy leakage have been initiated.
There is neutralized enrichment and cleansed process water in the field of the winding process.
In general, water is pumped for re-use as process water or, as permitted, is flown through the surface casting field into the environment.
The leakage was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current licensing conditions.
The rest of the material didn't go into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection cycle on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the basin dam structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the IMF is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation patroled with structural reforms covering Finland to address economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of over-work allowances and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, structural reforms are agreed, but there are small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of message for government action, but, on the other hand, there are also warnings about what should not be cut too much.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the Economy.
In the opinion of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts a 0.4 per cent economic growth for Finland for this year, which will rise to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske forecasts today that growth in the new cyclical forecast will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They might have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in small growth in summer, Kuoppamäki says.
The weakened confidence of the industry or other so-called softer indicators could again be reduced.
However, there are only a few decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, died of cancer, starts his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and she was popular and karismatic face in the gaming field.
For example, Iwata responded to the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwata footprints, evaluates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to take Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but it does not eat the company's bread on the side of the traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that hundreds of children who have arrived are missing annually.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported that hundreds of minor applicants will disappear annually.
The Superintendent Juha Kannelmaa of the Immigration Agency tells us what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappeared "under the country" annually?- A total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in 2013.
They disappeared nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made to 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The background to the disappearance may be the fact that the case shows that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be a full-year-old person there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing people will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were decided to expire because they were likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is there a number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 minor asylum applications on our own.
Total statistics on missing minors this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons too, he emphasises.
What's going on with those who have received a translation decision?
Will they also be lost, for example, in the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the implementation of the translation decisions is responsible for the police, Kantelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registrants.
He has taken action on this issue.
On Monday, the Orpo, who had considered refugee issues at the EU Council of Ministers, reported on practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
Due to the sickness crises, the equipment used for television and radio production by Timo T.A., a media careerr who lost his working capacity, is now on the market.
Mikkosen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment in Huuto.net, which was the most advanced tools in her industry.
The first news on the online announcement was the online magazine of the Iltamakasi.
Today, most of the equipment has remained on the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer described.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there are interested people.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but they are also needed for as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbies - collectors and designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks about the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from the current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the goods with us at all.
I've started to invene and see what goods are being handed over.
Now I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any specific use for television and radio equipment.
It is clear that a man who made a long career is not going back to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkose's real life work was already archived in summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited to collect box store films and other material from Myrsky.
The traffic threatens to be timbered by worse thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams today decide whether they are expanding power in relation to the mindlight on Friday.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram transport only for the time of the expression of mind to be held on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will determine if the traffic stops for the whole day.
The chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is big in the field.
The surgeries of nights and nights and nights are aggravating drivers, so government plans to cut lices raise resistance.
Hirvonen thinks, however, that it is a kind of dilemma to deploy traffic throughout the day.
If the metro and trams stand for Fridays, public transport is virtually completely stopped in the capital region.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between morning six and nighttime on Friday.
On Friday, we don't move near and long distance.
The trains that leave before morning six are driven to destinations.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain in the cockpit.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 to 3 p.m. Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven with the superior forces, the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that the HSL can't say exactly which bus rentals will run on Friday.
Employee organisations will organise a great demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Tower on Friday at 11 a.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian and Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at the school in Texas. The teacher thought the odds watch was a bomb.
In the United States, in Texas, the 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher held the clock that he brought to his school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his electronic exercise on the output.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were invited, and the situation ended with the kid being taken in handcuffs to a youth detention cell.
At no point has Mohamed been said to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a lie bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it consisted of a circuit plate and a digital display between which there were leads.
The case occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished by three days of forced school leave.
His father is angry about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country wonders whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Great Britain - Labour Director refused to sing national songs
In the song God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism made by the press on the right has also joined the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has infringed the people, I think the Labour Representative Kate Green has been involved in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday’s commemorative event, the fight against the German Luftwaffe was respected by British air forces in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and stresses his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in huge gratitude for the heroicity of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood honorablely silent during the national song, emphasised in the statement.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the labour line.
There are, in particular, people among the people who fear that he will expel moderate voters with radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the cessation of savings and the increase in public spending.
Mr Corbyn will be present today for the first time as a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
In the weekly twitter Cameron hung Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister questioned on his own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a trial
South Lake Minnetonka police have investigated the family killing in Minnesota Greenwood shortly a week.
The five - spirit family was found dead in his home on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45th.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house in the short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millionnatalo and a successful company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood clots is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets on the social media website for nurses on AllNurses.com.
In 2014 in StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been made 50 purchase offers from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have many ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Success was shown, among other things, by the fact that in 2011, the Short's family purchased an auxiliary house from Greenwood for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the dream of a collector: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for eight cars.
Judgment in progress
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering a variety of prep courses, had challenged him to court because of comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, the Short's website had not been removed from any comments that discouraged pre-cursors, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Wesku Loiri offered cakes
In addition, the owner triangle was rewarded at the feed event with the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner Prize.
This is great, Loiri comments on his tribute.
Celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned EUR 100,000 with his win.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the Grand Competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
The successful horse coach Korpi, according to Loir, gets full work peace in working with the horse.
The bucket determines and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri sucked.
The great gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens Superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children Hospital.
According to the hospital information, this is an individual donation to charity in Canada by the largest athlete of all ages.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal with the Canadiens eight years ago and $72 million worth.
So Subban’s donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives his name in the hospital.
Canadians’ players have already helped local hospitals significantly.
A year ago, long - term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
At the Japanese café, you can order a wife for tonight, serves food with bikini and a spoon on your head.
The tea bars are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat coat, chicken coat, vampire coat, catfish and now a wife coat.
It strikes the lonely, the pains of society and the hungry.
It's news from Metro.
From the Tokyo café Ore no Yome (my wife) you can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress who pretends to be the spouse of a client.
"Boliso" is selected from the list before entering the cafeteria and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is in front of just a squirrel and bikini on her face, the husband again in tight bikehorts.
The website offers all the information about the length and weight of the math they prefer to sleep on.
Almost 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: they started to be equipped with anti-auto security attacks
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as reported in Intel's newsletter.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The Company will continue to update the report on the basis of the findings of the ASRB.
The international ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road.
The same estimate suggests that 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Intel Security Director.
The ASRB enables Intel to establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important ingredient in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, making the ASRB board a right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays around EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Ford Focus RS has been expected to rise for years.
Finally, the car begins to be in the sights of Finland.
Ford has published RS information now that the car world looks at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford's new four-speed RS accelerates with its 2,3 litres, 350-powered engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and its peak speed is 266 km/h.
There is also an interesting price in Finland, initially estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it is announced.
Favorite Mark Kia presented two new things at the Frankfurt car exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, more important than the two new ones are certainly the new fourth generation of Sportage, where Kia intends to capture a larger wing from the ever-increasing street axle market.
The new European design director, created by Gregory Guillaume, Sportage, is more circular.
Axis intervals and external measurements have come in a cent here another here and the car breaks air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but it has been added to 177 horsepower-developing 1,6-litre turbo.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance as well as consumption are reported closer to sales.
We still have to wait a little, because we will have a new Sportage coming in the spring of 2016.
Already before the year's change, the new Kia Optimat came to our country.
Suddenly, the new one doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher level equipment.
Initially, optimise with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the rate will accelerate when they arrive with a 2.0-litre turbo engine equipped with Optima GT.
At the same time, with its arrival, the sale of the Optima farm starts.
Chisu came back to the scenes, exploded in a brave sleeve suit.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a transparent, open necklace in the electric pants.
The costume is a beautiful presentation of the waist of the singer star.
The whole thing is crowned with a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During three years of break, a mother’s singer has been given birth plates with light exercise and yoga.
Chisun's daughter will soon fill the year.
The singer published his first single album from a new album in August.
After a long break, I am not really excited to get back to the scenes and to get to the public.
I've missed everything to do with music, says the singer.
Chisu will publish his fourth album Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new situation in life has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, wondering if people find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's mother style is amazed again.
Real TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the subjects of speech one by one.
He presents his pregnancy abdomen and breast equipment in sexy clothes, last night at one time in America, when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian and his husband Kanye West from the show.
The black maternity dress is transparent in front of the breasts.
It reveals the skin-coloured chest straps underneath the dress in the flashlight.
The last time Kardashian dressed himself with an amateur maternity costume when she visited her friend at dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The costume was highlighted by the black over-generation keys.
The third special maternity dress is just as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation shift had its abdomen.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths of a model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from nowhere.
Although in the previous season you would have posed in top designers' costumes, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come to the industry, which compete for work with conkars.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that there is a hotel room or an apartment in which fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If your mother is very young and cannot travel with her, loneliness can be intolerant.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are all the more stressful.
There's not just one kind of magnificence.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Going to work is always a risk game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are constantly together, and at the same time operate as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is tricky.
Models want to do so because of the opportunities it offers, but they are disguised by the fact that everyone thinks that the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel they're actors with some role.
But in the work of the model you can also express yourself.
You modeled the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently spending fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year's modeling.
Roope Salminen, a styled musician, presents the most unknown musician in the movie
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, a band founder member of the Apulanta group in a film based on early years.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but divorced in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar, Salminen laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Antti before I got a picture, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown for people in that crowd, so I think it's very good that I'm just learning his playstyle from video.
I don't want to imitate a person.
The man who's playing the Roope Salminen and the Dogs group doesn't play a role.
The punk manaeers come from the man's nature.
Stars, Stars, in the punk period, many certainly saw the presmake, as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been a small seed, but we always go full.
The main actors of the film were published today, led by Tuukka Temose, who played bass in 1993-2004.
The band’s acquainted nucleic crowds present to the vast audience still quite unknown young actors.
Rumpali Sipe Santa Claus presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Hostasta Tatu Sinisalo founded by Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint on his future peste last night, when he told Snapchat mysteriously to prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new look, which he has had to implement for the movie.
Roope, previously seen in the fish and the chin beard, has driven his face into silococks, and colored his brown hair into black.
Psychology advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or do you want to tell me about it at all?
This is not a matter of force, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not let them look at the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and afflict, he says.
However, if the child has encountered television news images of refugees or has heard about them elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to discuss the starting points of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s fears may be surprising.
They may not be those that the parent thinks he's afraid.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared of yourself.
A smaller child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves remain peaceful during the conversation, the child will also experience being safe.
Larger children are likely to encounter a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them if they think about a child.
The fact is that not all people in the world have things well.
Parents can, together with children, consider how we are dealing with this in our family.
But is the world, in the end, a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also speaks of difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with future difficulties in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Lear your children to help weaker"
Your own forces at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalaland that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola made the Apilan Pallosalama sweep to the attack in the middle of the summer.
It only ravaged the profits and the second ranks until the end of July the Tampere raves collapsed.
As the ori was bogged down, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered for his protective period from a veterinarian.
The explanation for the ignition was cleared in the throat.
The horse had a throat headitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it required two drug cubes to cure it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, North Nordic states that he was positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time after the second SE tamma Taruntu.
Apila's Pallosalama was under severe pressure when it had been able to drive normally only a few weeks.
In view of these things, the small inclination at the end was understandable, says the Nordic.
The coach assumes that the fair competition made the Ori steel.
The horse's instigation certainly went forward, and hopefully it would also have been balanced.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When it hasn't been fun, it could have thrown fat without any sickness.
Instead, on a good day the Ori has removed such a flasher that the opponents have been wondered.
At the speed of the day, competitors can't handle the Pallosalama, from which even warmblooded rides can be removed.
In Vermo, there's a whistle run in the north.
But the different thing is how Apila's Pallosalama agrees.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it might even be stuck under the car's tree and so on.
I hope the Ori would be more calm than when Turku left.
Apila's Pallosalama will be able to come out of the bowl as well, and we will drive it out of the win, the coach promises.
That's why you can't get rid of the useless iPhone programs
The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple may intend to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook, CEO of the company in the interview with Tim Cook Buzzfeed.
The Apple iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newskioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips.
The most recent addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a compelling update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple Intelligent Watch owners.
According to Cook, deletion of Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company does not want to waste memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat today reported.
Price increases attracted downwards by low energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a slightly downward estimate of 0.2% in a couple of weeks ago.
In July the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
In the EU of 28 countries, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose by 1.4% from the euro countries most.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest in the fall of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area is still steadily far from the target of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is the rate of rise of 2% in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts on average 0.1% inflation for the euro area for this year.
Next year the increase will rise to 1.1 per cent, the central bank anticipates its publication in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
US Fed is trying to extort monetary policy
The next downturn in the United States will begin at the fastest rate in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed will start again for a long time to raise its interest rates.
And the financial markets, in turn, start down before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he might start interest purchases this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
The next downturn can therefore be pushed on at the fastest by next autumn and as the financial market rate rhythm before it.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they have always done, and if they react to the extortion of Fed's money wings as they have done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the Deutsche Bank in London’s market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle studies.
The Bank distributed a long-term Asset Return Study report on over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The research and report strategies do not believe they know when exactly Fed will start to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
On the other hand, they present economic statistics with the evidence and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously acted at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at the key variables in the economy and in the financial markets that are now on the same or another model than at the time of previous interest rates - and what is possibly the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a faster state to sustain the rise in interest rates than ever since the 1950s.
To the beginning of the recession, maybe not a year.
Fedi's monetary policy and its respective stimulus, the leaders have been suggesting over the last summer and the beginning of the autumn that the time begins to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate for more than nine years can take place this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Executive Board meets to decide at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed Fund guidance interest in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but at the same time minor 0.25 percentage points of interest ended for just two years, with Fed raising interest from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The symptom of the financial markets began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later, the financial crisis collapsed to a worldwide nightmare on the Judgment Day.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy imbalances began slower than typically since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were then harder and harder than ever since the 1930s.
The German strategies have screened the rises and declinings of the world's largest economies, as well as the turns of the financial markets since 1950 and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact will be clear since the 1950s.
As a result of the first interest rate purchase, the period has been less than a year, mostly less than three years and more than three and a half years on average.
The rate rise in the financial markets has ended over the period of two years following the start of Fed’s interest rates.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its control rate by ten different cycles.
Each time has differed from one part, and there is a relatively limited number of cases in consideration, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certain effect of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The key reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be found unquestionably even through decades of research.
But for three reasons which led to the crisis and raised its destructive power, it seems to be somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world considered their control rates too long.
They found the traces of the bubble, and at the same time raised the next one.
2) Over the past decade, the amount of debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy increased to an even greater extent, due to the impact of the central banks' surplus in monetary policy.
Born the largest indebtedness in economic history.
(3) In particular, the insane financing of the almost financial holdings of the financial sector in most financial markets led to the creation of the largest exchange rates of shares in real estate, debt securities and assets in the past.
There is hardly any serious dispute about the fact that, in the face of more and more complex debt bonds, the financial markets increased to higher levels were rarely dangerous and unstable, when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures of debt rows may not have lasted until their time after interest payments had started and the cost of debt financing had changed to the rise.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, which resulted in a major downturn.
Larger bubble and more debt
German strategies do not know what is going to happen next, but give the topic of the windmill by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) Debt has for a long time not been insane as ten years ago, but now the cheapest debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Therefore, the financial and real-economic debt burden is not reduced, but now, in the various parts of the economy, the debt burden is steadily higher than before or before the financial crisis.
(3) The liquidity from the former and cheaper central banks has remained largely on the financial markets and has reduced key securities and asset types to the most expensive, then the peak prior to the financial crisis or ever.
They also note that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the most severe recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but, in this respect, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are disproportionately higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten its money flows tighter.
Perhaps the French bank of Societe Generale's strategy's image of Albert Edwards' future is not as strange as its sudden effect can be.
He has for good time trained the Bank’s international investor clients in the following full translations of Fed:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon, it's time for Fed to turn out the financial bricks with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who manufactures computers and printers intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed to HP's business service party, says the company.
In November, HP will be distributed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which focuses on corporate sales, with PCs and printers directed to consumers.
HP’s staff was the largest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is deducted from 25,000-30000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers are accountable for more than 10 per cent of its business performance.
Another year, its three most important customers brought 65 per cent of their business performance.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax parish company
According to Yle, the Minister for Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the government of the tax parish company.
According to Ylen, the company's business involves so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed as a member of the government Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself said he had left a notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it, and that's enough for me to leave the notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place in the agreed timetable, says Berner in the interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The property of the Swedish Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia-Upofloor government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs government as well as in the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, Kährs' property in Luxembourg passes through the multi-step property structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted membership of the government in the Luxembourg company Kährs' second largest owner's request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia-Upofloor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was applied for to the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to ensure the realisation of the interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital gains are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's property in the company has no tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' capital fund Triton already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
In Espoo, a reception centre run by the company opens
In Espoon Otaniem, the first reception centre maintained by the company will be opened to adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 people from tonight.
The number of places may increase within a week to up to 300 to 400 people.
The Immigration Agency shall set up the reception centre in the property of the former Civil Protection Institute.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is in particular the production of healthcare and healthcare services.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative worker extortion package
The STTK is starting to prepare an alternative package for the extortion of the labour market of the government.
The organisation also hopes that other salaried central organisations.
According to President Palola, the attention is at present in the speech on Friday.
Alternative ways of lowering the labour price will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization's government meeting at a break to journalists.
On the other hand, Palola believes that the Central Trade Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The STTK’s economics have calculated that the change security provided by the government’s competitiveness package is estimated to be EUR 30 million to the employer, while the other side of the package is 2,700 million.
I don't know if it's a lot of enthusiasm to have a conversation if you have one relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has wished for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is expected to give a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola didn't take a position as to whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
According to Palola, the operation of Sundays is a painful place for STTK's field.
The organisation requires that the government withdraw from mandatory legislation to implement some of the extortions.
According to Palola, the STTK does not encourage the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to object to the labour market stimulus package presented last week by the government.
As part of the package, among other things, the wages for the first days of illness are reduced, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have called on employees to express their minds and did not intend to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder praises
The Akva President, Sture Fjäder, thanks the STTK for preparing the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming on the same lines with Ahava, because a longer time has already been set up as an alternative model for the government's proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, President of the Akava, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the proposal for cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he would prepare new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava informed that it has been preparing for a long time for its own proposal, which it is ready to negotiate the 5 % increase in competitiveness of the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and for a long time we have written an alternative model for the government's proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akva lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without GER, the package is not strong enough.
We are preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau of the AKA will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, joint coal, talkoes" - play bingo while talking to Sipilä tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva's green left-hand bingo coupon at Tampere University for tonight.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Möntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for a previous speech by the Prime Minister, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in holding a famous radio speech that meant the beginning of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
The President and ministers then held a number of radio speeches during the winter and subsequent war.
In the 1990s Esko Aho held a new year speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremonial.
In the autumn of 1976 President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike by train operators with a television speech.
Simply speaking, monarchist talks
The speech of Sipila has raised criticism and thoughts about what is going to come.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, said that "Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the private conversation has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Judge condemned Facebook that "monarchist thinking: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipila's dialogue: "Approximately six months from the elections.
There is no single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What's the fear of @juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Office of the Council of State, the speech of Sipila has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented directly on by SAK’s President Lauri Lyly and EK’s CEO, Jyri Häkämies.
It has been criticized for presenting Sipila's speech.
We considered the matter and found that the public service task is to promote a comprehensive publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
Like We at the time of Tammels
The speech has also raised anxiety.
When evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be bitter and dressed their best.
My mom's gonna put on a beautiful piece and my dad's putting a tie on his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., you shut up at TV as you used to be at the time of Me Tammeloids," writes blogger Saku Timone.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also telling in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax parishes with millions of millions hiding its capital, which have laid down laws for other tax evacuators, while at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut when the money is out of the state?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
On what Sipilä says, one guess is to present the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It's published a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the living of debts and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal on the exclusion of Al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have given up, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Axis Island, the Russian United Nations ambassador proposed a plan that, after some time, al-Assad would have left power elegantly.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they thought al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Axis Island, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three plans in the bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to have weapons, the opposition and Al-Assad had to get contact immediately, and the abandonment of Al-Assad's power had to be implemented reluctantly.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily agree on all the issues, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the interview with Guardian.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has communicated the message of Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tchurk did not confirm the content of the debate for the newspaper, but according to the Ahti Island, there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations of the Ahtisaari, but said that the Al-Assad troops had already committed several massacres at that time and the key opposition groups refused any agreement that he would have left to power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the UK Middle East Department, is reluctant to address Ahtisaari's speeches because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss Al-Assad's destiny.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in the Axis claim is that the Czech Republic spoke with the Moscow authority.
If he had told me about the speeches of Churkin, I would have said that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have suspected that it was Putin's cock to hold power with an al-Assad supporter.
A refugee flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on the Axis Island, about 7,500 people died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to escape from their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is what we have done.
I see no other option than to take good care of these rusty people.
Now we pay the bill we made ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Agency for Asylum Applicants at the Tornioon drill
The Agency for the Organisation of Asylum Applicants, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in the Tower.
The centre would be set up in an empty building in the centre of the city, in the building of the Tower.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki Sanomat newsed that the delegation had already decided to present the school building as a temporary solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Vice President of the City Council of Tornio, this is not true.
When the entire delegation was not together and some of the team wanted to have a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation to the next Monday to decide, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
The Centre opposed 13 delegates.
Based on this, you could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to the city leader Timo Nousiaise, the city was contacted on Monday, and it was reacted quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time would be able to join together.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred metres from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still hopes for alternatives to extortion from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central), halving the holiday money in public would only take care of a part of the price of the work sought by the government.
However, the government will gladly accept an alternative package if the social partners succeed in reaching an agreement.
In the Parliament, Sipilä told the journalists that he had not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for substitutes for the extortion of working life reported by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly welcome it as part of the whole package.
In Sipila’s view, halving the holiday money would be a means of doing so, because it would affect almost all the employees, unlike the government’s plans to cut Sundays.
Labour market organisations could agree on the reduction of holiday money because they have been registered in collective agreements instead of in law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will tell the Parliament about the extortion of working life in a communication by the Council of State.
According to Sipila, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This isn't the final rear limit either.
The legislative work will then move, i.e. the train is moving, and it will become more difficult.
It's a good time now.
It won't take long for such things if there's a will, Sipilä has made it.
Last week, the government's list includes changing the final and helators into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the wages for the first sickness days will be reduced, overtime allowances halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation, which has led to strong criticism.
On Friday, the activities of the Employee Centre organisations will hold a grand protest, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi's delegation approved the extension of Mahahall's warehouse
The Tohmajärvi delegation unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy's control, or Mahalahall's warehouse.
It was the judgement that the project was larger and more expensive than originally was talked.
The busy schedule was also tight.
It was also somewhat wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous enlargement was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400 to 450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the money will be decided in the subsequent part-year report.
Another item on the agenda was the investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk in the municipality, because the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Vämmistö (ps.) justified.
The language of Karelia also stands in Joensu
The City Government reduced its previous strong position to bring karelian street signs to the centre of Joensu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the choice of a livestock tradition in the whole province.
Joensuu does not declare itself a capital of the language of the karel because it has no historical grounds and the language of the karel is a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the river River has been more part of the eastern savolage.
Even after a new decision, there will be no carnival street signs in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is well prepared, on a case-by-case basis, for use in the livestock language, for example, in the information tables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same approach to the city is recommended for all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, it is also worth taking a generous view of the karel language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly even in North Carolina.
The language of Karelia is still characteristic of the province, as is the picture of Joensuu as a forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used for the multi-purpose marketing of the province.
The termination of train connections reduces the province’s vitality
The cuts of train connections strike the province's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the province's business and competitiveness.
And it affects whether you can live and work here at all, Kari Karjalainen, the city director of Joensuu, wonders.
He also raises the question of air transport, which has also been continued several times in the report.
For the whole province, it is important that we do not manage to reduce our opportunities by state measures, as is going on.
We should look at the impact of these stopping connections on employment, for example, the Karian emphasises.
The worsening of travel connections creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services are here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland, says.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research purposes.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market a university towards Western Finland, because the intersectional connections are weak.
At the moment, about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
Approximately 10-20% of them are from Newland, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Flood became one of my sorrows for the war of You
The view of the city council of Joensuu on the provincial Soun War project seems to be unanimous, but one of my sorans is.
Mr Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Council, presented the abandonment of the entire project at the government meeting on Monday, but his presentation was unfavourable.
The Board approved the draft decision by the City Director Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Cotka Kouvola ends next year
Passenger transport from Eagle to Kouvola will remain in the future, even if one train shift is less than one.
Passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola will be subject to changes next March.
One train dock is left, but still five times a day you can get from Cot to Kouvola and vice versa.
These agreements are due to State savings.
Purchasing fees for the next four-year period of the Ministry of Transport and Communications will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one didn't get down, the guys flew out of the place.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climbing from the climbing roof, who couldn't get down from the roof with his own help.
The situation was created in the Tower Mountain at Ketotie at half six a.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no stitches to the roof at all.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb on the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one of them didn't.
As a result, the rest of the world flew away and the passers alerted the rescue facility to help the last one safely rest on the roof back to the surface of the earth.
Change in FedEx turnover, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak results in the last quarter. The transport sector was weakened throughout the year because of the decline in demand for freight services and the increased costs of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for a vacation.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he hired 50,000 seasonal workers for vacations.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual opening of trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast shows a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's investigation, the analytics predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened by an average rate of 4.9% despite price increases, which will enter into force on 4 January. Additional charges for land transport of heavy or large consignments will enter into force in November.
The company still expects revenue growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and growth in online trade.
The President and CEO, Fred Smith, noted that the company was well-expected in a weaker economic situation, particularly in the face of production and global trade.
The seasonal employees' hiring plans were informed on the day after the competitor UPS announced their plans to hire approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90,000 to 95,000.
In the quarter ended on 31 August, FedEx’s business profit amounted to $692 million, meaning an increase of 6%.
The result per share was $2.42, so the projection of $2.44 of Zacks Investment Research, a 12 analyst, was left.
Turnover rose by five per cent to $12,3 billion.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12,23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has experienced a decline in international first-class broadcasts, which has led to a evacuation of the company's Express unit.
The strong growth in the online trade has confirmed FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, turnover in land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the business profit showed increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on freight operations fell due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual opening of trade, FedEx's share price had decreased by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $1150.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell by 11 per cent from the average of the year and by 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the Fed decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank will meet at the most anticipated meeting in years. The crowd sits at the eight-metre honduran pub table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room, the wall painting of the United States is beautiful.
The map is a reminder of the fact that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must place the economic interest of the State above all other interests.
The Central Bank has a dual order from the Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the management of the Central Bank has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be lacking in the light of the decision by the Central Bank on Thursday to indicate whether the US economy is willing to start the withdrawal of an unpredictable stimulus, which the short interest rates, which have finally remained near zero in 2008, have been offered.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent collapse of the financial markets can make the cautious central bank officials ready to scare the increase in volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate – even in a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important to monitor their practices," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of the bank movement Stipel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank seeks excuses not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market will give sufficient cause to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who are thinking about the matter disagree with what the Central Bank intends to do, which in itself already causes nervousness.
Approximately half of Bloomberg's economics' research showed an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to be expected by the Central Bank, and according to the main indicator, there is only a possibility of 30 % increase.
If the central bank raises its control interest rates, the stock rates may be lowered unless the decision-makers soften the impact by promising another increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index dropped 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The background to the upheaval was the expectations that the central bank would keep the tax rate stable this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's Chief Economics Officer John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this stage," he said.
"If this happens, the Central Bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of the financial markets without trembling."
On the other hand, experts noted that the increase in interest rates could calm the financial markets and eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be going to increase interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has noted that during spring and early summer she has been waiting for interest increases this year, despite the need for economic progress according to the Liberals.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is now at the lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank is falling to full employment.
Salary income seems to increase
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual 2% targets of the Central Bank, the central cause for this was the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with even higher interest rates and it needs them as long as they take into account the strict situation on the labour market," said Pantheon Macroeconomics, the main economist Ian Shepherdson.
However , the financial markets around the world were not shocked last month when China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16 percentage points from the May record height and investors feared the Chinese economy's decline will also affect global growth.
The market has increased this month, and Dow Jones has now already dropped almost 10% of the May peaks.
The collapse of the markets means for the decision-makers of the Central Bank that the consideration of the increase in the steering interest rate will be further complicated.
"The work of the Central Bank will be complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and the news of the decline in the Chinese economy in recent weeks," said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate's older researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner.
Now he believes the central bank is waiting for at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy. The recent post-China economy has little reliable information," Oliner said.
The main concern of the Central Bank is not to restore the global economy, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the Central Bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential entity in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere suggestion from the silly president Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce the scope of its activities resulted in changes around the world.
In the present world, markets and economies are closely interconnected. In addition to monitoring the world's development trends, the Central Bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the central bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Director of Envestnet Inc's Global Strategy.
This month, President Jeffrey Lacker from the Richmond Regional Bank said that the Central Bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to the basic pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, who was entitled to vote in the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), has called for an increase in the steering interest rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led to the central bank's decision at three meetings to lower the 0.75 percentage points of interest, although only limited sanctions were available for US economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank canceled the decision.
"The Central Bank should focus on monetary stability in a major crisis, as in the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
He said, "The last controversy does not even bring about that situation."
"It is in no way worth fearing the lifting of the chores because of the shock of the market," added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability.

The Brazilian Association of Children’s Doctors Rio Grande promotes proper diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Association of Children’s Doctors in Rio Grande SPRS has developed a blind way to teach breastfeeding women the meaning of a proper diet. They show pictures of babies breastfeeding with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This gives the baby all the food they need and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to an additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie by about 500 kilocalorie.
According to the new study, further changes in diet should be made in addition to the increase in calories.
The recent research of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine, Robert Waterland, revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet could affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from the development of tumour.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise's most viewers, even though Nine is trying to catch the lead position in his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson challenged Canberra's morning programme on the post-elections of the Liberal Party, which, however, did not much improve today's audiences.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent to Malcolm Turnbull's capital after Tony Abbott was dismissed.
David Koch and Samantha Armytagen have sent a competitive channel morning program from London. Special shipments from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun are also sent for a week.
It seems that the intermediate route was not relevant to Australian television viewers, as Sunrise was viewed by an average of 397 000 viewers in five capitals of the state, and Today by 339 000 viewers.
Today's viewers rose slightly compared to last Mondays (317 000) and Tuesdays (283 000), but left last Thursday (343 000).
Today has stuck a distance to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there were 40,000 to 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349,000 viewers and today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for asking!

Significant innovation Seven had a 800 Words series of news with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The novel drama tells us about a recent widow's father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
The critics have doubted if Thomson's hit series would be enough for a star alone without Rebecca Gibney's Rafters star.
According to the viewers' figures yesterday night, the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor retained its strong position with 1,36,000 viewers. The series was clearly defeated by The Block (838,000) and the TBL Familys series (726,000).
Sevenin The Chase Australia has captured viewers varyingly.
The first half-hour of the new show series by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00-17.30) followed an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half-hour (17.30-18:00) the number of viewers rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase had an average of 520,000 viewers in the first half of Australia, and the second half collected great 720,000 viewers.
The number of Hot Seat viewers was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night viewers showed the Nine channel that the Hot Seat will pass in 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minutes, which could not challenge McGuire's series.

The final triangle really thinks Sam Wood is the son of the Dreams – but who does the man choose?
Did the secret be revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unintentionally revealed the choice of the dreams' boyfriend.
The final choice of Sam Wood's dream son has been a very preserved secret.
Three remaining women don't squeeze a word about who has received the last rose from the boy.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows for the atmosphere before one of the triangles was thrown away.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women shine that Wood is a perfect man. Women praised the man’s sense of humour, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him suitable for themselves.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose would not hit their own place, their answers could give an indication of who takes the heart of the boy.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the most suitable partner for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have all been easy since the beginning.
"As soon as I got to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam are well suited to each other. This feeling has remained throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has feet on the ground, and he is really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there is chemistry between them.
They seem like a couple of characters.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me she realized last week's hometown date that Wood could be the real one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race. I'm now making a full stake in our relationship," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much as Snezana and Lana are equal."

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne since this moved to the United States. Several other clubs also interested in the man after last year’s impressive open day of practice.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as was the man in the Australian rugby team rows. Hayne radiated the flight hit back to the team after taking a win from Minnesota on Tuesday, reading 20-3.
Tomsula, however, showed his confidence in Hayne and gave him a new opportunity to return the flight hit. Coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued its line in a dressing cup after the game.
He didn't snatch the entrants in front of the other team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
49ers Special Journalist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by the team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne will capture Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been waiting for another man from the NFL debyte.
After the failure Hayne left the field 100 and later told Hamish and Andy 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start on his NFL career.
"This happens, and we have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne compared a mistake in the State of Origin series of her debut in 2007, when her input in her own area opened a place for Queensland.
The whole experience was still unbelievable for a young person aged 27.
Hayne published a picture in Instagram, where he poses together with the fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
Openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski, was convicted, the man's oil company Jukos was measured out and his democracy work was limited.
Four dead after the police shot with rubber bullets protesters in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the official source told me on Wednesday. The police shot a crowd with rubber bullets in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country. Among the victims was a four-year-old son.
The violence occurred in the area of Rupandeh on Tuesday night, less than 300 miles away from the capital of Katmandus.
According to District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing rocks and firearms.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired in the air before shooting the rubber bullets.
He said twenty policemen and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered as an alternative to less destruction, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent gathering of weeks of ongoing protests in the southern Republic of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new Constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protes have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands their own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are policemen, have died in violent twins since 10 August,
When four major political parties signed the agreement on the division of the country into provinces, this is a significant step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislative authorities have accelerated the process after the shocking earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted on the Constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and the authorities say that a new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60% probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
About 560 kilometers from the vast low pressure area from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde islands, 60 per cent of the probability of developing tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the United States National Hurricane Centre (National Hurricane Center) on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Air Science Institute, the center of clear low pressure is also located in the mid-Cap Verde and the Little Antilles. It can also be 60 percent likely to become a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google intends to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that he was launching a campaign aimed at collecting $111 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people escaped from war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in his blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of running the campaign, Google's employee Rita Masoud started telling us about her own experiences. He was only seven years old when he fled from Kabul with his family.
"We walked on a dark train and bus and had hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the crisis in Europe, many families in a similar situation are very much in need of help.
Donations will be made to non-profit organisations who help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and the UN Refugee Organization.
Once donations have been collected from google.com/refugeerelief via $5,5 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, thus the total amount exceeds 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is the worst since the Second World War, which worsens the four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to flee home this year.
The war will also have to escape from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Slightly overweight diabetes may benefit from an obesity surgery
According to the new study, type 2 diabetes patients with mild overweight may benefit from an obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether type 2 diabetes hyperweights are living longer after an obesity surgery than those receiving unoperated treatment.
"Recovering mortality data takes time," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on fatty surgery, who dealt with new research in JAMA Surgery.
Musculoskeletal surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce starvation and limit the absorption of food in the body.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have affected patients with an overweight body weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index shall indicate the weight and length of which the normal value is 18,5 to 24,9.
When the weight index is greater than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index exceeds 30 indicates significant excess acidity.
You can calculate your weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwanese Min-Sheng Hospital Researchers benefited from data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two fatty surgery methods, gastrointestinal transient surgery and sleeve surgery, with type 2 diabetes medicines in moderately fatty subjects.
After the gravity surgery, the average weight index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
The weight index of patients treated without surgery was maintained in the sense of 29.
Surgery-treated diabetes was fully healed by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes was fully healed by only 1% and in part only by about 2%.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and malicious LDL cholesterol were also better in the surgical group.
Studies also monitored the haemoglobin A1c levels in patients, reflecting the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin A1c level is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at approximately 8%.
The haemoglobin A1c is reported to control blood sugar levels. However, the study group led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgery methods.
In the fifth year of the abdominal transient surgery group, the weight loss was higher than the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight index was higher (7.4 and 5.1) and the haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%).
The new study did not show lower mortality after five years. According to a Swedish study at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, the surgical treatment, however, brings fatty people for life.
In the Swedish study, the fat people who were subjected to a transient abdominal surgery decreased the probability of mortality over 15 years by 29 per cent compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, however, Blackstone confirmed that persons with a weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study, because it says the surgery is safe in the lower weight index group and it does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
"We're waiting too long for people to take the situation seriously," the scientist said.
"When genetic changes that are exposed to fattyness and diabetes are accumulated in the human body, it is really difficult to translate the situation."
"Everything can't come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is not able to receive all refugees, Dalai Lama has said, and he says that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leadership of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in refugees' home countries.
Dalai-lama addressed the refugee crisis in his visit to the United Kingdom. Dalai-lama held his speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, focusing on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, humanity should be placed ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the response to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible that everyone could come to Europe," Dalai-lama said in his speech.
Although Dalai-lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, she stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Taking care for thousands of refugees is a great act, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," said Dalai-lama.
"We must finally consider how we can reduce the killing in these countries.
Power use must be reduced.
He added that the problems with power tools have never been solved.
In speaking of violence, Dalai-lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the context of the 11 September terrorist attacks and claimed that, in responding to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would arise through non-violence.
I know that his purpose was good, but he relied on powerful means that had unpredictable consequences," Dalai-lama said.
I handled cases of swallowing in children quadrupled in four years
According to the Georgian toxicity centre, the toxicity centres across the United States have reported a high level of alcoholicity in cases of seizure in children under 12 years of age almost fourfold since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Centre for Intoxication, the cases of hand-sucking in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of them are getting first aid," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handcrafts intentionally, part to impress their friends and part of the social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers who drink disinfectant because of cheap drunkenness.
Teenagers are told to mix alcoholic mouth water with the disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted by the scent of handwriters.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"More of the attractive handmade products are just smelled.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange handmade products that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small number of children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcoholic strength of the Secides is very high", Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital's poisoning centre, told the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
"No one would leave children with whiskey, but if hand disinfectants are often left with children, they quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old, recently enjoyed four lorries of strawberries in the school, and the girl was provided for emergency care.
"The amount of blood alcohol was 179, which is twice the adult drunkenness limit," says the doctor Chris Ritchey Atlanta, a Gwinnett Medical Center near the girl.
Nhaijah had no chance to walk when he was brought to the emergency.
The doctors followed the girl's space overnight in a separate child hospital for brain damage, because she had fallen and beat her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey told.
"Your place was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products and disinfecting towels in addition to the transfer of your hands to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing handcuffs containing toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities thought that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was reported to be an active substance in the product leaflet.
According to the police report, three four-class students in the north of the state of New York planned in January to kill a "vicious" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is highly allergic to the hands and forbids it to be brought into the classroom.
The police considered the past plan to be irrelevant and urged the training in discipline.
Huhumylly: is not inappropriate in Celtic rows
Griffith reduces the inconvenience of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that it's not all well in the team, but believes he's getting the situation right.
Hearts buttons with the SFA for Neilson punishment, and Warburton watches the January player transfers so that the team's unity does not suffer
Aberdeen's neck to Celtici with five points
ADAM Rooney's first half-time punishment brought Aberdeen a small victory from Hamilton in the Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen's five points away from Celtici.
Griffiths reduces speeches about incompatibility
Griffiths has ignored rumors about the inconvenience in the Celtic lines. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not being monitored when preparing to meet the Dutch director of the series.
"I don't think we have any pressure. I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch Need an Old Scottish Fighting Couple — de Boer
The former middle-field player of Rangers and the Dutch country team player Ronald de Boer have found that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has ceased because they are no longer allowed to follow Celtic and Rangers' double fights.
De Boer, who works in Ajax's team, said, "In Holland, no longer presents Celtic's highlights.
'Cause the Rangers are no longer involved."
"This isn't just about the return of Rangers.
We're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch need a double fight between the teams.
Old Firm's games have a huge tension, and they are also interested outside the Scottish borders."
For the sake of translating, Deila assures me
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is difficult, but the Norwegian trust assures that the situation will change.
The company lost to Malmö fell out of the Masters League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has five-point leadership at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it raises anger or sorrow in many.
We are, too, but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic's supporters, because it significantly strengthens players.
"Common spirit is really important now."
Warburton Careful in January Player Transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton suggested the January slots of the player, he is cautious about the transfer line and says that he wants to jeopardize the team's unity.
"January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's former coach said.
"The players involved in the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the season begins, which has been successful in our composition this season.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes unnecessarily purchased players can cause more harm to the team than benefit."
Michu, who thinks about living in Celtic
Swansea's attacker Michu has been associated with Celtici's player transfer speeches, and Michu has invoked retirement after the end of the Swans agreement.
The 29-year-old Michu has been an abominating ankle for years, and he couldn't get a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA contest on Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3–2. The defender's red card was later revoked. It is already the third Collumin red card within eight months, which will be revoked.
But Neilson stays behind his words. "I didn't question honesty. I didn't comment on the performance.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reproached when the man admitted to having snuggled the disgusting songs from the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at the pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn area before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local fight, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee that I won't go back to Tynecastle except in Celtic's lines."
Tannadice's leadership believes in Dundee United's training management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's management team can turn the situation better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for the fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes satisfied with the Hamilton win with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced against Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league win. With the win Aberdeen caught five points of neck at the top of the Celtici serial table. It is thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half of the field.
"There is no Cup or League winner team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
MAIN WORKERS remained unchanged in Scotland in May to July, with 164,000 unemployed. In the whole United Kingdom, the number of unemployed rose by 10,000 at the same time.
According to the United Kingdom Statistics Centre, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared to 5.5% in the whole United Kingdom.
The number of employed persons in Scotland is 12 000 less than three months earlier, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter, with an average employment rate of 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Scottish Minister, David Mundell, commented on recent figures: "The long-term government plan has created a basis for a strong economy."
Nearly just a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision on maintaining as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has declined.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for revocation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is done what I do not hope, I will sit in the prison of the state of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I responded to the invitation with consent.
When this day comes, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you about the death sentence.
The angle of vision would be unique.
Journalists will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than places, participants will be selected with a macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced the locations of journalists from 12 to five.
You choose to follow the execution moderately.
I can't do that.
I sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends. I have created a personal relationship with a man, because we have spoken on the phone several times in months, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to prison staff, I can't be there both as a witness and as a journalist, so I can't take a note and a pen to make notes.
I just have to try to think of the details.
I was accused by an Oklahoman reporter on Twitter of compromising neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell him the convicted story in a pleasant way, you'll get close to him."
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The journalist admitted that she could have made her word more carefully, but still considers me wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed about something I've said and written.
He doesn't decide what I write, and even if he was trying to order, I wouldn't obey.
I've told him that he can remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity contributes to a move against death sentence.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat details in this context.
I can't tell you that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of his assistance after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that man Glossip has not been guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe that there was no sufficient evidence for the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
The indecent description can be read about other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you how it feels to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was attracted from the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he pulled the man up from the Canning River.
The perthian man's attempt to flee into low, muddy water, and a policeman a few metres away was allowed to land him back to the dry land.
Canning Vale's police got a call on Tuesday for an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect who tried to escape the police's support by heading to the Canning River.
But the man didn't get far.
"The man standing in water announced that he would not come out of the water and urged the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not tempted to drain his dress, so he chose a safer tactic — a negotiation.
"Sometimes, an attempt to escape makes people rely on fun ways," said Sergeant Castledine.
Soccer champion Ben Cousins' case is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police blowing and tried to swim on the other side of the Swan River.
The man's attempt was condemned to destruction, but the tempus inspired the locals to design Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody says the journalists tried to spy, and he threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody accuses the journalists of Racing Victoria of their spy business last year. He threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that journalists and Racing Victoria's corruption department have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tatain for the treatment recently given on the race day was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for competitive sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when Lidar's sample found a cobalt and he couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept her tongue under control for the charges of spying for an and a half year and didn't want the charges to seem bitter to a man's action.
"I didn't intend to raise the matter. I was thinking about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration gets discarded," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes we have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the situation after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and sleeping well.
I want the horse owners to believe I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse coach.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody previously dropped a bomb in a Racing.com interview, where he told us about spying companies in his booth.
"One and a half year ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my booth to spy on my actions. I'll tell you the man's name on request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a cheater.
If so, they should have the evidence, because I have not been caught for anything unauthorized.
The former president of RVL, Robert Roulston, the current president of RVL, David Moodie, and the current CEO of RVL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the activities at the time and now.
Should I take the situation as a personal chase?
Should RVL take real action and give responsibility for the situation in the sector to non-trainers?
Am I an inconvenience to the industry?
Am I really an inconvenience to the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think that.
Maybe I'll still have a training license and push me out of my duties, and I don't have any doubt that I can get many people to think that.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I urge them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long - lasting investigation of Lidar’s cobalt values and the recent rejection situation made the coach frustrate in the end so that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unschlaged champion Black Caviar. He described the race day rule as ridiculous after the horse was put in a rotary wheel against the rules.
"The care is inconsistent with the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"A person of my personality wrongly put a horse's leg on a horse.
Savi treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can expect a three-month ban on non-regulatory treatment, which the organizers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested from Cobram's crash site
The police have arrested a man who hit his biker this weekend who escaped from the crash site.
The biker was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by a helicopter, and he had serious injuries when he was hit by the car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove the car fled from the place and didn't leave to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to be waiting for charges for failure to comply with stop and assistance obligations in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the pains of opponents in the crowd
Melbourne Storm's coach, Craig Bellamy, considers the criticism of his team's tactile game as a purpose-seeking operation of the NRL's two leagues.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges allowed Storm to press Melbourne's hosts to win a karriage game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett covered the most difficult reference to the Storm at the Queensland Cowboys' win-up final on Saturday night. He called the game as a model game and said that there was no special concern about the pressure in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his own team's game and said they were just focussing on contact when they were tagging.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was added by the fact that two team coaches criticized his team. Bellamy considers this as an indication that coaches are concerned with losing Storm.
"This thing always arises. I remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything to press when his team won us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defence system or technology all year round. For the last six weeks, we've only been working on contact games and tactiles, which has turned us up.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and the loss could have been a shock for him because he has a great team that hasn't been used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always arises at the same time as the year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett about what is interesting for football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne is talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team's Saturday game to our Friday game and kept their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St George received plenty of criticism of his boring game. Wayne said that the review doesn't give him any time.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast central offenders.
That kind of football wants to play when the player's arsenal is like this.
He emphasised this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not every team has central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence in this when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team and relying on this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the Storm and Roosters game made more paintings than when he met Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. We had more situations in our game, but is that interesting football?
Or are gambling and minorism interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, because the team will be coming Saturday to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronu Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man freed against bail of $200 000 in the drug case
The man who is waiting for a lifetime sentence has been released against a warranty of $200,000 for possession of 40 pounds of cocaine smuggled into Queensland.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the police found a hundred pounds of cocaine cargo from Solay, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in the port of Coomera in August.
The police watched Maksimovic's meeting with a fellow criminal in the port in the morning and surprised two of them later at the Coomera Roadhouse café.
Although Maksimovic may expect a lifetime possession of a drug for commercial purposes, there is no evidence from the husband's lawyer that his client would have tried to get the whole batch, but he could have been in a café for an innocent purpose.
According to Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic is trying to escape the country.
"Maksimovic has clear connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather paid together 200,000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"After reading the false testimony of both people, it is clear that $200 000 will be a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"But it is not alone enough to prevent a man from fleeing," the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released under the condition that he handed out his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police every day and stayed at home from night to morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the paedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of children abused.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was asleep and logged in to the online message service where she got another user to send himself unfavourable pictures of children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed that the phone was missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she browsed the content of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother about it.
These five images were notified to the police. After looking at the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search words for unfit children's photos.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead the paedophiles on the Internet and presenting the police to fear the paedophiles.
Attorney Eilidh Robertson said at the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed he was addicted to people's intimidation.
He admitted that he had done the grave on a computer, but claimed that he had done so to present the police and thus to be able to scare the paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and asked Hogg for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the paedophiles.
He said he had disturbing thoughts when drinking and wanted to watch pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After finding messages on the phone, the girl shouted to her mother with the vibrations and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was interrogated.
The girl said the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls that looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road confessed charges for the possession of inappropriate children's photos on 14 June last year. Hogg violated his exemption against guarantees on 25 January this year and failed to arrive in court for hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed in the register of sexual criminals, as it can be considered that there were no significant sexual features in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the proclamation of the judgment in October because of the background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted exemption against guarantees in this case, but he was held in detention on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe is holding the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest African Head of State Mugabe fell in the stairs led by the speaker rookie earlier this year.
Mugabe didn't hurt, but the video of what happened spread quickly in social media.
Parliament's openings were also shattered by the arguments made by the legislators of the opposition party that they had been subjected to anonymous death threats, warning them not to bow Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the MEPs buoyed and interrupted the speech on the situation of the President's state in Parliament, which took the same speech on Tuesday.
The Bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages in which they were urged not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "Death", Gonese told the journalists after the speech of Mugabe.
The message warns the recipients that outside the House, representatives are no longer immune.
According to the president of the party, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving business activities.
HP will be divided into two stock exchange companies later this year and will separate computer and printers from faster growing business equipment and services.
According to HP's newsletter, the company will record the one-off costs of $2.7 billion of the arrangements from the quarter.
"The new arrangements allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who runs the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move into a new business style," Whitman said.
"Our position as our own company is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company is focused on the mission to deliver unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s at Stanford University is now divided into two. The twin founded an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Piilaakson.
A massive reorganisation of HP has been carried out when traditional desktop computers are switching to mobile devices.
The changes in the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and HP among the largest technology companies in the United States are the latest transfer in the field that is believed to be successful by concentrating.
Captain Mikel Arteta of the Arsenal: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before you meet Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes through a rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four English country teams. The man's history of his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest shame of the last problem is that Wilshere decided strongly after last season’s ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former steel under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't improve properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It didn't have to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically the matter may be like this, but as Wenger also said, additional injuries may occur when the player is trying to return to the field during the season.
There is also a noticeable unpleasant regularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different efforts since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal rows in only 65 totals 157 leagues in the last five seasons.
The wider picture of the Arsenal is that since the period 2007-2008, six of the eight seasons, the team has been the second of the teams that have lost money due to most injuries.
Wenger accepts a potential witch-eye, but Arsenal believes, last year's healed wounding load continues to evolve in a better direction.
"Sometimes the return after the injury can be associated with a vulnerable period of time, when the body must be strengthened and the competition power sought," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope that he will have his body in balance, and I believe it, and then his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will start his Master League work against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night. Then the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Wenger will prepare for small changes in composition.
Hector Bellerí and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are the likely beginners.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to ensure the team's balance and give rest to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to continue the F group, Maximmir Zagreb is the most frightening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible during the 41 game team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the country was shaken with strength on the 3.2 Richter scale.
The shock was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his last-season lesson since he had to tailor to Monaco. He is also still motivated by a far-reaching hope for the team to be set up for the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"The Arsenal hasn't hit this title yet.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, with experience, I am also realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreaming."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about men's friendship
A similar description shines in other series, especially when it is noted that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide statistics of young men are highest for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the major cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide was three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by proclaiming 2015 for men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study interviewed 2,000 high school students, which showed that healing potential for depression symptoms is better if there are adequately healthy people around them.
The probability of disease was also reduced by half if there were people in their vicinity who had no mental health problems.
However, the basis for everything is friendship.
Today's communication dominates social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast reactions are often considered more important than relevant contact.
As a result of the digitalisation of life, the need for a strong, fun and successful doubled, although isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and social status that come from the outside of the surface of success, all of which draw attention to our inner values and to our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
Recently, a millionaire in the video game sector said that money can't really buy happiness.
The Frendie's fineness was that the series turned the priority to its top.
None of the characters of the series were defined according to the profession, but according to the personality, which was reflected in friendship.
The series was presented humorously by Joey and Chandler in haling or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often missing Rachel. It was clear that men were able to get along with this, even though they did not abstain from feeling fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I heard depressed and suicidal people, I became clear how much the least reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do it is strong. Man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frendits is one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
I can provide help from outside in a moment of desperateness, but long-term support will be provided by friends and families."
Comedy Central's FriendsFest's series of scenes has been resurrected. So if you take part in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
Never knows how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest
The hit by Di Maria helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after making a painting against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the painting in her Masters League debyte and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and appraisal.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain started his work in the League of Masters by hitting the Malmö Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debyte game had been played less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of French champions immediately in the process. However, PSG threw several goals before finally able to add their leadership: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A section also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only looking for a tracking place in the drop-down games, but also wants to improve its positions for the quarterly matches in three remaining matches.
Although SPG captured the scores, the game was not perfect for Laurent Blanc's team's show. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place of painting and the man was in exchange when he was in front of his former family, where he started his great career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in guests in the master's league, so the 2-0 wins and good extracts give us a good base, even though we still have to betrayed for the season," Blanc said.
"This knows good.
We were winning and able to do so, but it's a shame that we couldn't get one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team's line after the wound. The team had to satisfy the 2-2 game in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux this weekend. Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in his shadow for four minutes.
Last month, an argentinian lawn from Manchester United to PSG's lines was named PSG's solicitor, who raises the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of his appointment when he accelerated the ball from Marco Verratt's feeding past Malmö's defense and then shot a precise hit to the back corner of Johan Wiland.
However, those who were waiting for PSG's break profit were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic's drop-down games, marshed into the field from the start of nine international players. The team of five men's defense and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
The shooting of Nikola Djurdjic passed shortly from Kevin Trappi's goal in 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into vain feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals only in the first half of the time. Immediately in the early half of the second half, Ibrahimovic kicked the paint on the pottery of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the feeding game. From the feeding of Ibrahimovic, Di Maria shot a spin-off over Wiland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the time of the county Cavan. A uruguayan who played through it shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic fetched him with Maxwell's left-wing attacker.
Malmö's wing ended to another goal, and only Wiland's peak fight from the nearest distance to David Luiz was kept the readings under control, and Ezequiel Lavezz's finish was abandoned at the end of the metre.
Afterwards, Åge Hareide, the bullet of Malmö, admitted that PSG was his own class. "We played the previous Champions League game in December of last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
It's not enough.
A hat for the Parisians.
This was a top fight for them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in equity
The Swiss miner Glencore, which was tested by lower raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion in the stock exchange on Wednesday as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in his opinion that he sold new shares of the value of approximately GBP 1.6 billion to reduce debt.
The market value of the company fell by 57 per cent this year. The company is struggling with the price breaking of raw materials when the Chinese economy's downturn is detrimental to demand and burdening the market.
As a result of the stock award, Glencore's share price had a lot of pain at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69 per cent.
Glencore announced last week that she intends to collect $2.5 billion in equity as part of a strategy to reduce its debt of $30 billion by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 penny, with 2.4 per cent decrease in the closing price of Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the group as a whole.
The concern about the continued decline in the Chinese economy has led to a decline in the price of iron ore, while the decline in coal, copper and other goods has been between 20 and 40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's Washington visit
The White House Communication, published on Tuesday, confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States for a State visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on 25 September. This is a counter visit to President Barack Obama after his visit to Beijing last November.
After the bilateral discussions of the Heads of State, the President of the United States and the spouse of the President Michelle Obama will arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan for a State visit.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping offers the opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China in the area of a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics of interest to both sides. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues of disagreement," states the White House Communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February and is expected to visit Seattle to meet several US technical leaders.
Obama and X are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about the alleged cyberspeed in China and the increased activities of the country in the controversial waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces diversity in film production
Matt Damon talked hard with the African American Effie Brown and said that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
Brown was interrupted by an actor who was experienced in the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, explaining how important it is to take into account the different views of the manuscript selected for the project for a dark person.
"The diversity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," Damon said.
Brown was stunned and wounded by the claim. "Wow, well," she said after the comment of Damon staring the Sole in Mars.
Damon and Brown had met with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly’s brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoeverever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is presented," Brown said at first.
"The only dark person is a prostitute who has sex with a white coupler."
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film. Damon answered boldly that the choice of duplicates could lead to the unwanted outcome.
When the discussion was presented on television, the social media exploded from Damon's disgusting comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger about the seizure in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only dark person to explain what diversity is, is so whiteness that it hurts."
It was distributed more than 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at the time when the equal representation of human races in the media is one of the subjects.
After the teenage Michael Brown died of a whiteman's police bullet in 2014. Black Lives Matter was supported throughout the country. The business seeks to stop the discriminatory treatment of legislators and authorities with darkness.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the album candidates of the year in the Grammy gala.
"Albumes still matter," he said.
"Just like the books and the lives of the dark people, albums still matter."
Recently, Black Lives Matter published an opinion in response to Fow News's question by Elisabeth Hasselbeck on whether this group should be described as a hostile group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," said the director of the movement.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media moguls who have been invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if Damon has responded to the invitation.
In American Ninja Warrior series, first winner
Isaac Caldiero, a professional fan and bag collector, took the first American Ninja Warrior score on Monday and cleared a million dollars of his victory.
In the seventh period of the TV series, for the first time, all the tasks given were investigated.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and the photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the final mission, men had to pain from 23 meters of rope up to 30 seconds.
Britten explained the mission in the first time given. He was the first competitor who has performed the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race with a strong acceptance. However, Caldiero performed the mission three seconds faster and became a winner.
Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after he caught a million dollars.
"The winning amount is incredible, because I've never earned more than $10,000 a year," he said in E!'s interview on his winning pot.
Suddenly, I can't even imagine what's going on with this, the future is open.
The responsible producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten is not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to find out all the tasks.
"The rules say the quickest to win the prize money.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest to win," Weed explained.
"Of course, the money prize is wonderful and transforms life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he'll stay here to bury it any more.
He's just satisfied with his performance.
He's got a lot of praise from the fans.
Britten is a great guy to whom family is important.
His children and his wives think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he would prefer to win just Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought the same about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eightth season, whose descriptions begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers pushed the win of Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers have no particularly pleasant experiences in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, is now the last place in the American League Central.
However, the team succeeded in hitting Minnesota Twins Target Field on Tuesday.
Twins lost his opportunity to rise up Houston Astros to feel like fighting the second wild card place of the drop games.
Detroit returned, even if only for one night, to a taste of victory, which has been in the second half of the season behind the stone.
"Every victory is nice, whatever it can be achieved," Tigers-lude Brad Ausmus said.
Alfredo Simon, the Tigers feeder, kept his surface when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two rounds, one in the sixth and another in the ninth rounds.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in a good game and let three runs.
He's only got three good starts in nine outer hikes.
"I just want to finish the season firmly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a switch in every game, and that's why I want to feed up to six."
Tiger's feeder substitute Victor Martinez got three hits and hit two runs, which were his first hits after mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three hits after he got four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well," Ausmus said.
"He looks good at the beat exercises, and he kept the lead in the game."
Twins had the best chance to get back to the game.
Byron Buxton, a mid-couper, started to hit two nests close to the left side line with a hit directed.
The right cup Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice line, and Simon took the second Brian Dozier, who took three straight feeds before he replaced the left handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free-tip to Mauer, a new feeder placer Miguel Sano hit two nests, and after him the right handed Drew VerHagen.
When there were two runners in the field, VerHagen got the third Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
The Major League team led 27 times this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit had beaten the ninth round of the race at the first round, Tigers finalist Bruce Rondon hit the two runs, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right handed feeder threw three straight feeds and was able to maintain the position of his team.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
Tigers got three runs in the first two rounds against the right handed man who had just got back from the list of injured people to the field. The man was on the side for months because of spinal inflammation.
"Of course, the beginning was not as I wished. However, as the game went forward, it began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform and get a few good inputs in the third pair," Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes gave one nest hit to Ian Kinsler in the first couple.
The real cup J.D. Martinez free tea brought Victor Martinez the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 tube broke when the team had players on the nest.
The third Nick Castellanos next got one nest hit, one run, but Victor Martinez burned in trying to move on to three.
Tigers added his lead in the second pair. Kidnapper James McCann survived the hit on the second base and Anthony Gose on the first base, then the situation was 3–0.
"Simply hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but the hit hit the right place."
In the feeding mountain was Hughes, who fed a third scoreless pair of shifts, then he was replaced with his right-handed replacement to A.J. Achter.
Hughes' balance was three runs, six hits, a free teak and four straight feeds.
Note: Anibal Sanchez, the right-handed beater of Tigers, was not involved in the composition due to the impact on the shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of wounded people since mid-August, and he was supposed to join on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, the left-handed beater Daniel Norris will leave the list of the injured and will be involved in the start-up assembly against Twins.
Norris has received 1-1 in four games after his left-handed hit David Pricee on July 30.
He has been out of composition since August 20, because of the abdominal muscle depletion.
Tigers and Twins will decide their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, run average: 4.43) receives Ervin Santana (5-4, run average: 4.73) from Minnesota's right-hand feeder.
Xi urges to open the economy to the rest of the world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world in order to promote growth," said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday at the meeting of the Economic Reform Steering Group on Tuesday.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and developing economic opening policy", the president said at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group set up to deepen the comprehensive reform.
"Promoting a policy of opening up and deepening the reforms will push new momentum and vitality for economic growth," Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted guidelines, including a negative list of measures for market access, reduction of border control policy, promotion of private capital participation in state-owned companies and revision of the registration system for citizens.
According to the Communication, a negative list of sectors and enterprises to which investment is prohibited is to be drawn up.
The system is gradually tested and developed through testing programmes.
According to the Communication, this is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, the legal business environment and the opening up of the market.
The government also reduces the supervision of companies, and I would like to ensure that companies have decision-making power on their own business.
According to the Communication, China will allow the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border areas and the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
With the opening of state-controlled sectors, many sectors open up to private investment.
"Management does not change its foreign investment policy, which supports the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and offers them better services," the Communication states.
In addition, applications for a permanent residence permit are made by optimising the requirements and streamlining the search process.
The meeting also discussed the right of lawyers to exercise their profession and to support judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunsha and Zhang Gaoli.
