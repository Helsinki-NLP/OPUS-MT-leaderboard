Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of ailments), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 metres of altitude, where many walnuts had gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While the planners of the United States road network have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the auto-road infrastructure in decrepity, many are the ones who see a solution in the form of a small black box that sits above the car's table.
The aircraft, which record all miles travelled by a car driver and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices to redesign the obsolete funding system for major US roads.
The sector generally uninterested in the planning of major axes has suddenly led to a strong debate and movement of alliances.
Liberals joined environmental groups to make pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road on which you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while Congress members are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking at how they will be able to move over the next decade to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of carists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental transfer.
This is truly essential for our nation.
"It's not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state will begin to record the miles travelled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that Americans pay for the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans don't buy as much fuel as before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase tax, even by one cent, while petrol prices are high.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State has recently installed 500 car trackers to test a mileage payment system.
"This proves to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this for cost of use at kilometre.
It is not surprising that the idea attracts urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce the burden and emissions of gases, for example.
Californian planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the state's ambitious laws on climate warming.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
The supporters of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay a mile.
"This is not just a tax in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former United States Transport Secretarys, who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go in the way of payment to the mile.
The American Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year that would have covered approximately 10,000 cars.
But the President of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to go to their work or city.
However, several States and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is the Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the most important experience in the country.
These motorists will soon pay the State kilometre costs instead of petrol taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York envisages one.
The Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which comprises 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) examines how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers recently equipped their car with a device, the drivers were concerned that the government could follow their smallest facts and gestures.
"The concerns about Big Brother and such things are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something people want.
As soon as the test started, the Nevada CFU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full location devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and heavy technology infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep daily people's paths and arrivals recorded.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now deporting to find affordable technology that will allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to make use of a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to States.
She was trying to penetrate the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their kilometre.
But the devices that it test has enjoyed the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded regularly by modem.
"The people will be more inclined to do this if you do not record their speed and not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In the Oregon, planners try to experience by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, prefering to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to mistrusting citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In the city of New York, transport officials are looking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide a "drive payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid overlapping.
"Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on the mileage payment is not just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the leaders say that Congress could easily manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gas tax.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol, so everyone pays their right share.
"It is not necessary to use radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of carists will be worried about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four in-edits in listening
The English musician hasn't finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, it concocted a luxury reed scheduled for November 4, with several unprecedented editions.
Four have already emerged on the Canvas.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to shine the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Not read of surprises, David Bowie had more than one turn in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to recast this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real party for his fans.
This reed, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three albums: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five specially unveiled songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a booklet to share its own prints, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, he gives a pre-smake of his new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a heavily controlled rock power.
Ineditors Already Listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informator, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-faceted: an intro worrying before a light cavalade that slows down gradually to leave room for a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
Gitarrist riffs, enchanting, show the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie at least enjoys playing the Cameleon with these titles: an informative tour, a man on board a rocket, martial potential...
He dissimules and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising that he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the Campaign The Invitation to Travel, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarically released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civil life.
Attacked by the Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, the military members followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not comply with the military's "universal service" rule requiring staff to be able to carry out a series of various tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period for pension benefits.
They mentioned in particular two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay for another year to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not comply with the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with the Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major battles in Afghanistan, the army has been hard to determine the latitude it can accord to wounded soldiers who want to remain in ranks but are not fit for the fight.
Under the current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service time required to obtain pension benefits.
The Liberal spokesman on former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on tablets to launch a live series
The American Media and Entertainment Group Disney decided to prefer tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via his phone and tablet application.
Its global launch on Disney's chains is expected only in 2014, details the Disney Junior Division's release.
The cartoon, designed for children aged 2 to 7 years, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, a sheriff of a city in the West of America where she makes the order rule with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqué.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its public through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of under 2 years of age have already been using a tablet or phone, and 72% of under 8 years of age, respectively, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence detector, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the MEP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has clearly been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to punish the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, said at Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany was severely tested as a result of complaints that the NSA had listened to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the parliamentary group supervising foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and completely ruining the relationship with the United States," it would have to be enjoyed.
Mr. Ströbele, German Green Member, published a picture of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, said the MEP.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "grave and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as senior leaders – including in the United States – considered the disclosure of an unexplainable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter introduces an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Câble subscribers could well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix's video service on request via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary announced on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet, interviewing.
Cogeco Cable thus puts a step towards its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date in relation to this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not have access to at present.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not quoted, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussion with some major cable distributors so that its service is available via their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper Government during their Speech from the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"It's been about two and a half years that we say that the idea to force consumers to buy important chain packages is not working," said Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) would result in interesting recommendations.
"It will be necessary to emerge from these discussions as a new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," said Cogeco S.P.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry in the spring.
On the basis of the results, Cogeco reported that it had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, from the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decrease by depreciation costs associated with new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for a total of 526 million.
Cogeco's revenues increased by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7%.
They amount to 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its principal subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, in declining compared to 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable's revenues, however, increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Câble is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about seeing the number of customers fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not the indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the other with a very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been found in containers of beef-based products, sold by two small British low-priced distribution fields, today announced the agency responsible for food hygiene.
Routine tests revealed that the products produced in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save chains contained horse DNA from 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been included in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to examinations by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that were supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles resulted in four injuries, early on Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 hours, a motorist who was in the north direction, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and struck a car that came in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid of their lives.
The traffic was back to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in her ad on Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the unopen canvas with them to the flight descent.
The new hand luggage costs relate to the bags rowed in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said that she would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travellers only paid once at the boarding door.
The Frontier spokesperson, Kate O'Malley, indicated that $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Airlines began to pay the first and second baggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in the luggage lined in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers transport less things on board.
O'Malley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money.
This is about making the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger who makes a queue at a Border boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these fees before they arrive at the door.
Frontier hand luggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often rupe about luggage and other costs, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street consider the addition of luggage costs as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them have not affected the cost of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first cost of hand luggage three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, which follows the additional costs closely.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's cost of hand luggage was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former member of Midwest Airlines, recently travelled to Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the unusual luggage charges imposed by the company.
"I had never seen such a smooth boarding process from my entire career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth grinning and a fight burst at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passengers were on board at the speed of the lightning".
Frontier also makes as Spirit and applies $2 fees for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopen canvas with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after the passengers complained and when no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay hand luggage when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to purchase directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, she reduced the 25 per cent bonuses on a trip.
Thus, a 1000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal client in its original city, Denver, but her activity is declining and she loses money.
Revenues declined by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to recover the finances of Frontier by selling the airline.
The NSA challenges an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow stated on Friday that it was a bug that caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some claimed on the Internet.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spying agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been out for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the speaker.
At least one group of online hackivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to invade a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the target system.
The NSA has once been ultra secret, a time called the "No Such Agency" and has been strongly criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs – which are part of the secret files of the NSA stolen from the Agency and disclosed by the former unused NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations that the incident of tonight was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre City now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund owned the building sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 still have no new job.
Delta promises not to drop his employees.
Employers have come to meet employees directly on site, and employees have been met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta occurs in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate, so there were dozens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else, and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, owner of the Transat Tourism Chair at the School of Science Management of the UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become an elderly residence.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be seen in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "the Goodyear Amiens Purchase Project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the sponge with freckles in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear of Amiens-Nord site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumatician Titan, today declares ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 that the plant has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Rehabilitation, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant's purchase project in January, you come back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fous" trade unions, referring to the CGT.
We don't understand that face-to-face wing.
Is that to be a pleasure for Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to make anyone happy.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of taxation and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, in China and in many other countries, work is done 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has space to grow.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, this is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the plant closure announcement, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys the closed factory at Goodyear.
Titan could therefore move machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan accepts to recruit them among the current 1,200 employees of Goodyear.
Therefore, Mr. Montebourg needs Titan's commitment before trying to bring the GTC to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the GTC and Goodyear seal an agreement on starting allowances for all employees.
Therefore, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must first agree on departure allowances.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide employment warranties when there are no employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to agree with CGT and Goodyear and Titan buys the factory, we have the intention to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The profit of Bombardier declining, while the deliveries and orders of aircraft declining
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent decrease in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a decrease in flight orders and deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Nor did Bombardier, based in Montreal, provide any flight test data for his new CSerie aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial service schedule by September next.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the test aircraft stole only three times, and then the question was whether the test phase was in good direction.
The results were not predicted and the stock price decreased by 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst in the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, from "overperformance" to "sectoral performance" due to the low stock exchange growth potential in the next quarter or two next quarters.
"Although the decrease in aircraft delivery has been largely premature, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We think Bombardier will record new commands for his CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has been modest up to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's assertions on the energy efficiency and potential savings of the new line aircraft.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Head of Management, is convinced that Bombardier will reach his goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial operation of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday by informing them that the programme progressed in accordance with the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that soil testing and software updates were planned during the time the aircraft stopped.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We had decided to take a first flight and to foresee an update period, and that is what we have done.
This will occur throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, said the company.
However, the analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first client can fly a CSerie plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was assessing the timetable for entry into service and will provide new information over the next few months.
"This slow flight tests – although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal calendar – reinforce our opinion that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The adjusted action result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and income of $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared with 57 one year earlier.
Net controls fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautical Division was $32.9 million as at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues decreased by 13 per cent to $2 Md.
Bombardier, the largest railway manufacturer in the world, said that revenues from this division had increased from nearly 11 per cent to $2.1 million.
The Transport Division order book totalled $32.6 million at September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered implementation problems with a few large contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Head of Financial Management of Google Inc, would be a member of the Board of Directors, dropped from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aircraft manufacturer in the world and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists were worn missing in a whistle under the Crolles Dent since Thursday night, we learned from the Speleo help of the Isère on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one warri to practice and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday around 21:30 in order to carry out a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We were then without news of them since, specified the same source.
"Speleologists should have come out around 5:00 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, Technical Advisor to the Spéléo Relief in charge of the Relief Organization.
Tens of people on site
Twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firemen were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of gameologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, has transmitted the information to one of the emergency teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Chambéry Alpine Chasers battalion were found "exhausted but not wounded".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps waiting for relief, said the Prefecture.
Feeded, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to escape Google and Yahoo
On Thursday, the German journalist union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services after further disclosures on the activities of the American and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid the use of Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging," she said in a press release.
She considers that Washington Post's information, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltring international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communication with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union claiming 38,000 members.
Fires Repeated: a Member asks Brigitte Grouwels to resign
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels to "relifting" of signalling lamps in Brussels does not like everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project on Thursday in the centre of Brussels to paint 16 lights in the region with yellow and blue colours in Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
In the future, the idea is to paint all Brussels signalling lamps for an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamanization" of the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "resignation".
"Not content to spend the money of Bruxellois folly in operations to lift the signalling poles to the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of the Flemishing of the Capital," emerged Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her yellow-mangue-noir taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-blue-now-blue the panes of Brussels.
According to the honourable Member, "there is no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brussels people deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who himself realises the NVA program.
It's time to stop Troy's horse from Flanders.
"For a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of Bruxellois!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portal of Pont-de-Buis demonted
The ecotax porticus of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismissed on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national was diverted in the fountain.
The decision of dismantling, announced by the Prefecture of the Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, the manager of the portic.
This is the last of the three ecotax portals that operate in the Department of the Finistère, the other two being dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching a Accessory Store for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a listener, a loader or a storage box.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a microfibre protection case or an intra-early listener.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father got rid of the world of the living.
At the beginning I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so scared of forgetting it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequent".
There is no recipe, use mode to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a soft wake up in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father that accompanys me in my gestures every day.
Our mother left us after her exhaustive fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her body empty, screamed on this hospital bed with frosted sheets.
Likewise, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the thin light of the candles that were setting his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Slowly, by small daily or nightly appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, moving forward as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that believed to be sad.
And then she showed herself while revealing my own facets that I had not yet perceived, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated this person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and behold, I met her full and full.
This turn from my way of life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and outside" it sounds like.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at that time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he got old, sick.
Now, I didn't fear him anymore and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I had a pain...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, living in my body.
I saw his hands by looking at mine, lending him my body.
But it was never indiscrete.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and comforting to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I constantly feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought?What would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always one thing that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply absent from them.
Sometimes some dreams carry me on the contrary and embodie themselves in my history and actually they continue to live and share my life.
On the echo day I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I was waking up, I was standing out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor, and he smiled to me and was glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with joy what happened to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my stomach.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I am pleased to tell you this common memory that lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused me to be in the young son of a bitch at the time.
After all, I realized my mourning fast enough.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I'm in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to make it a master in a large school, have not been, with the backwards, anodine choices.
In fact, I often heard it speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has induced me are always present, so that I may think about how she wants me to act at a given time.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and righteousness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a loving soul, a saver spirit.
I see his eyes standing on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying alone, anywhere, anywhere, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
And then, the time slowed down.
Only the lack, this emptyness without answer, the need for it, to trust me, to reassure me of its softness.
However, she is here, silent presence, she is here and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worrying eyes standing on me, I see the cranes that raise his eyes, the riddles around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the front on the days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually reappeared to smile, and proclaiming his name is no longer taboo but comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the dark of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morals are a little attained.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the slowdown in time makes us realize how she was the leader of the orchestra and we try to stay in the way she had followed us.
If a being loved you very much, the absence can not take it away from your heart and memories.
In some way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 due to an asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't attend his funeral, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from my own, I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep about it and I always wonder what he will think about it.
I don't know if I have adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It was almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was six years old.
Of course, the enormous punishment that then invaded me has been reduced, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "barks" in my dreams in such a precise, alive way that when I wake up I'm even sadder to see that it was just a dream.
Last night, he asked me if I was fine, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in overwhelming anxiety and I turned on the headlamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to arrive.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I turn around to see if he's not here, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In every room I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or his mind lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since his departure, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him, and I never speak of him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the most bloody month since 2008
October has been the most murderous month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the President of the United States.
Nory al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Nory al-Maliki spoke to the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by the Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They made signs of his being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocainoman lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the lord of crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the big day.
He was sentenced to a three-year imprisonment by the Liverpool Court
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after compromising his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was named "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "primarily important file", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial related to drug trafficking.
The police detected the 32-year-old Sarborough, who deposited three cocaine bags at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a regular consumer of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her portfolio and credit cards.
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the provinces of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for a sum of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction would be revealed in the great day.
Today, at Liverpool's seat court, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors' Office in Blackburn, fell disgraceful after having been found guilty of two charges against two charges of inhibition of justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him coming to Ditta's home and putting drugs, purely 60 per cent, under the lawyer's garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who was at a football dinner at Ewood Park, pregnant at the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned to his home, discovered the drug, and they called themselves nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular cocaine consumer after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her portfolio and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the suspected drug trafficker because he was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her portfolio and tried to remove several credit cards, but they all were seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that it happened that clients called him home for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "If anyone must know that we should not violate the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved in private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He has hindered the investigation of the police as much as he could to enable him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He was too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence compromise.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta moved from criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he started to get drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine forever compromised him and made him vulnerable to the backdrops of the leaders of the organized criminal groups responsible for obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter behind the lace of his profession.
The unit responsible for serious and organized crime in Lancashire conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of the three indictors of possession of cocaine and now of inhibition of justice, proving his commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself, during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the death corridor in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will come up on stage in December
The newspaper Detroit News reports that the Queen of the soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board Room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds in November.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous Respect interpreter had stated to the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She says she's happy to be back.
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres from the seaside covered with a light coat: the hot shot in Menton could be blown with the bill of illuminations.
Fact that, unlike many municipalities, is more regulated by taxpayers, not by merchant associations.
To mitigate its costs, the city uses leds.
But also differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at L.A. International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, at least 2 were injured.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff went to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very quickly police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is evacuating and air traffic is interrupted.
Classic singing for teenagers
Every time, school clients will be targeted, an initiative that has been successful in the previous season.
Through five Saynets imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vines with a high dose of humour, teenagers are able to apprehend classical songs.
In addition to this show, the lyric Society of Art of the Kingdom will return with its lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room full of the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in summer 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the lyric Apero, the benefit-winning concert held last August, with the support of the Marie-Eve Munger coloring soprano.
It was a profit-benefit activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as a flap-souris air.
Without giving precise figures, the President of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is drawing well, even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant support.
"Finance is floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would even say beyond," added the Director General, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child in hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey school faces six indictors, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage, sequestration, accusation of threats, port of weapons in a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to immediately dissolve the situation were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet by means of a communication.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective appeal against Saint-Croix brothers
A new application for collective appeal was filed against the Saint-Croix brothers concerning sexual assaults that had taken place this time at the St. Joseph orphanage as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J.", which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the St. Joseph's speech, where he served as Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was for only three institutions, and when the regulations were announced, many people told us, "I was in that place, can I register?", says Advocate Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been lodged is of particular importance to allow the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuses could have been committed by members of the congregation of Saint-Croix.
Currently, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the congregation of Saint-Cross and the St. Joseph oratory, which is a separate entity, " have allowed sexual abuse against children to be committed", that they have "exerted moral, religious and psychological constraint on victims", that they "are aware of and yet suffocated sexual abuses" and that they have "consciously and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Saint-Croix brothers, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives on this matter by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly declared abuses.
The collective appeal must first proceed to the stage of admissibility at the Superior Court.
Once admissibility is accepted by the Court, the second stage, or hearings on the merits, shall be carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint-Croix had agreed to settle with friendship before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in LaSalle arrondissement, Montreal, in the night of Thursday to Friday.
The relief was called around 1:00 a.m., Friday, because of a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian kitchen restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with the Rejane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were expelled on the site took almost an hour to control the brass.
The fire "has caused significant damage to the building's structure," said the head of the Montreal Fire Safety Service operations, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firemen arrived on stage.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments could have to be accommodated provisionally, said SIM.
Many oppositions to medical assistance to die in the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote in favour of the draft medical aid bill in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to put an end to their days, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If we were to focus on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The Chair of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the draft law on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she regrets.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie's house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be in any way unnecessary.
They never ask us, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the bill of Quebec disorientates the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the step.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of end of life should be clarified before the bill was adopted.
Kenyan press is unworthy of the controversial law on the media
"It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask itself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from putting an end to the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconical and very punishative, and we refuse it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected radio stations and websites of independent news in Kenya.
He said that the new media court would "be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians," he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to "manage the media." The Standard, as for him, stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya " had been hit hard" and fused the bill calling it "draconian".
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack of armed Islamists in Westgate's trade centre last September.
The Kenyan media raised the anger of the authorities by broadcast video surveillance camera images on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack stole the so-called luxury commercial centre.
The chief of the police, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling on two journalists and one media officer to interview them, although the convening was withdrawn as a result of a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be liable for fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million, with the additional risk of being "spoken" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "only one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want in impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"The politicians, who were delivered to themselves, would put the country into bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and picking."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took a position against the cuts ordered by the National Commission responsible for wages and restored their miraculous wages by approximately 532 000 shillings per month tax-free – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Laval Health Centre and Social Services (CSSS) caused an emo to the direction of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short leave, the pharmacy department has found itself highly deficient in staff.
Almost 30% of the required staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the SSSC has decided not to engage an independent workforce, which may cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use of depanning," explained Mrs Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced to a level, the time things are replacing.
It is certain that we have worked hard to attract our young people [in the pharmacy] to come and stay here.
There is a competition in circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have brought fruit, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain in the service of the SSCS.
Now it's going much better, stressed the pharmacy.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
More and more demands
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as those experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have a young environment and a lot of young women are employed, so with pregnancy, we are almost always running on three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year we've had a lot more, and we don't have any pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model does not start his career in cinema through the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose her to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This egreen pornography drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1, and January 8, 2014), is the erotic memory of a quadragnarian who has grown to sex since his teenage.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with his elder is striking: a silhouette of brindel, a diaphane paint and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of the risk: the one who had no hesitation to put naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in the middle of extasis with Shia LaBeouf.
While the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their pudder in the closet, he used X professionals for the most dared sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses in their last cuts, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first meeting of a film was interrupted at the Narbonne CGR Mega, as a precautionary measure, as a result of throat tingling felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility has evacuated the room and warned firemen for a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
Persons were examined and a complete recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad jokes on the bottom of a larymogen jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still it is that the film management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in full.
The room was aired and everything got in order.
The film has been able to reclaim its rights and customers can regain the pleasure of the images.
Only on screen.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine in crayons
Enjoying Halloween's day, a woman tried to bring two pounds of cocaine hidden into the country in crickets, Thursday morning, at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passport baggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been divided into three citrols, which had previously been emptyed.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Office (GRC) which took the relay in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range ground-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new Tsahal air raid in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli Haaretz newspaper) has not been confirmed either by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances similar to those of July 5: at that time, it was also an anonymous American officer who confirmed an Israeli attack in CNN, this time targeting Yakhont Earth missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their anger to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of requiring President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaching bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency reduced Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, doubting the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in the recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt securities note goes to "B-", which is part of the category of speculative investment.
It has a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one out of three chances that it will be reduced again within a year.
"It is increasingly less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currencies to meet its high external funding needs," the US agency explains.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves declined by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits abroad.
These reserves, which are widely used by the authorities to support local currency, hryvnia, collapse, the Agency is increasingly likely to devalue, which would increase its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its imports of gas to Russia, which accuses him of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its still relatively modest debt has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-09 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has for months been claiming assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a $15.3 billion credit in 2010 and has been disbursing only $3,4 billion for the moment.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, particularly by increasing the prices of gas to the population.
Following a new unfavourable mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "important external funding needs" were "vulnerabilities", while taking into account "significant economic improvements".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "one cannot expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope for unpopular reforms to be launched in a pre-election year", as presidential elections were planned in 2015, the expert, interviewed the PSA.
The only hope is to improve the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels requires the release of Opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P, who fears "business restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which represents a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the establishment of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen border controls on imported goods.
United States Green Fire at Merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objections from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger is closer to the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group have today announced the expiry of the previously announced time limit for the review of the merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary for the execution of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on the acquisition of other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese army hunts the M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of northern Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to have been beaten after being hunted from the northeastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which it has been controlling since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We will continue the M23 and take it anywhere it hides because it's criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman of the FARDC.
We must not let them reorganize themselves because they have martyred the Congolese people for too long.
It is time to bring peace back.
Heads of M23 explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said at RFI that these military reverses would in no way change his claims to peace talkers.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Attachments are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality at the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion occurred in 2012.
At their apocalypse in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of the province of North Kivu, benefiting from the leakage of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's most important workforce, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade consisting of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC Staff was reorganized and the army went to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of war.
The pace of progress of government troops today is unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be at its end," predicted a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historical - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied in Rwanda would be present in the eastern part of the DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, who denies it, of military support for the M23, which was formed from former mutinous Congolese soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesman from the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military repression following the embossed in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgeoisie to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be released by the army one day," testifies a resident of this border location in Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized," said this man.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus have proved negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France so far".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already committed 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refinement margins, while its production of oil and gas increased while remaining in withdrawal from the group's objectives.
Its net profit from the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, one year earlier.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters recorded an average share profit of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, rising compared to 2.52 million bpj produced one year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million GDP for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
The majority of growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from $45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refinement margins affects the entire sector.
Thus, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a net loss on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the School Commission of the Region of Sherbrooke (CSRS) has required a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students with two residences, a service provided by the organization when able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSSR was invited to a mediation and requested an additional time to consider it.
"It's always better to talk about it, work together and find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization has only indicated that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency at the Hotel-Dieu
In the face of the frown that had been carried out for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "decale the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency which could not take place on 4 November".
An official request made "to avoid any risk on emergency care in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign at a few months from the local authorities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should nevertheless be effective at that date.
Even if, in the APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firemen who provided approximately one quarter of the 40,000 annual transfers to the Hotel-God will all have been given order to take the 30 serious cases a day to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of internships.
At Hotel-Dieu, emergency specialists will leave place on Monday to five general medical practitioners.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the course of the month.
"The Hotel-Dieu emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4," assures without delay Loïc Capron, the President of the Medical Commission (CME) of the APHP, who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firemen, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he says, claiming the permanent presence of vehicles from the SMUR on-site to transfer serious cases.
Senior urgent doctors will remain on site, he also assures.
But it is the SAR's responsibility to decide to close the emergency service.
" Things are doing gradually," says Nicolas Péju, SAR spokesman for whom, on November 4, " there will be no change in service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or was lied to him," regrets Dr. Gerald Kierzek.
Departed from his post as Chief of the SMUR in early July for leading the bullshit against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "alert launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "medical-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencys that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
However, they are regularly enriched.
There are, for example, nine hours of waiting at Lariboisière emergency.
In the SAR, it is argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent a "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
In both SAR and APHP, the "new hospital model" has been defended since October 7 and is expected to continue receiving 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also participate in the establishment of a "ambulatory care permanence".
"Where are we going if we ask people to diagnose themselves," wonders Gerald Kierzek for whom "the concept of not serious emergency" is "hazardous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go wherever there's the best offer of care.
If the Minister does not take any action by Monday, we will change the braquet, tells Christophe Prudhomme, an urgent doctor and a member of the GTC Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, Paris's UMP adviser and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergency at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we were to rely on responsibilities".
On Monday morning on France Inter, Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, reiterated that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that no closure would be made on November 4.
If so, she would mark her clear disagreement," stressed Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable schedule of transfer to other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American officer on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume the case of NSA's listening after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Interviewed on the subject, one responsible for the U.S. administration replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Under the seal of the anonymous, this responsible did not specify whether such monitoring had been established in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given approximately at the same time as the one that ended listening to the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes, but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the preservation of such information.
United Nations welcomes the new goals for combating poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the previous day in Rio de Janeiro.
They were part of the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "pass national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and tailor themselves to the process of setting universal sustainable development goals," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate which has been entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development objectives based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts arise between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, who was driving them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Director General of an investment company.
Concerning the future of her country, she exchanged her working clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd accumulated in the place of the capital independence on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangings since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have affected foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 million of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Vale, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the power party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is the source of recent confrontations and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamo bastion on 17 October.
The attack on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman of Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimise concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "losser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that the Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have not succeeded in mitigating the tensions caused by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who continue to argue," said Joseph Hanlon, a speaker from the open and specialist university of Mozambique.
None of them are well able to negotiate and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of Renamo's votes has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to receive more votes in elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the Presidency," said Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has led disturbing light attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North-South motorway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where is Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked whether the Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustration of the government," says Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"The people think that the leaders of the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is the latter's responsibility to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said that people wanted only stability.
"No one cares about the Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "models of lifestyle," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "brut force does not make weight in the face of subtle ruse", while the arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, far too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "scrupulous selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly educational" makes the children "tolerate completely," being "sublimated" messages in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimed; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The well-known base of what is shown and not said.
A fighter in the armed branch of Hamas was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli chariot shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and safe sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian Territory and Israel when they wiped an obus fire from an Israeli armor.
NSA spying: the United States is "too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the field of spying," recognized the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington confession in full polemic with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelation and denial between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government officer explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception of communications and data by the NSA in Europe.
"In some cases, I agree, as the President has done, that some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this will no longer happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London which he participated in since Washington on Thursday 31 October by video link.
In his speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified information and information collection practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had been dismantling many projects of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding and people being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects upstream," argued the head of American diplomacy.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been misled in this process."
But we are trying to collect information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolute to try to clarify and that he was reviewing these practices so that no one felt wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to flush this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, NSA captured data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which quotes documents from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the "MUSCULAR" program, conducted with the British NSA homologue, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by the Internet giants.
To believe one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the only month of January last - from metadata on emails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any link to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA had massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak about it, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied to him that his intelligence agency captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States, and this would certainly not target Europe," said General Alexander.
And the polemic stretched on Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has called on Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a broad international spy network that has also triggered China'sire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without his master's power, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco, has distributed the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The communication simply indicates that it is "blessed", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered an inflammation of the left knee when he returned to his selection at the beginning of the month.
A Ceremony in Memory of Crematized Deceaseds
The Crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a lay ceremony, in memory of all the dead crematized in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris mayor, must attend and will then explain her proposals on funeral at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obseques, more and more French choose cremation rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obseques of a close, it is the opposite: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the turmoil of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-chairman of the National Committee for Ethics of the funeral, emphasises the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence made to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a bunch of ashes" in very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "be accompanied by the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which involves the "release of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymous" of the ashes.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, President of the Society of Quatology and author of the book Appreciating Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprehend it.
Understanding the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the City of Paris's funeral services, to provide the deceased with a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a funeral.
The annual IPSO survey shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French want one, for their relatives, whether they are religious (53%), or civilian (24%).
From now on, 73% of people who chose a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of the atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the release of the ashes," said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now propose ceremonies, which, in the presence of the body, proceed to the following ritual: hosting the assembly, appointing the deceased, connecting him to others, raising him, giving meaning to his death, organising the addiction.
This has been the case at the Crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium of Father Lachaise has since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, organized several ceremonies of memory, lay and non-religious, to which he invites the families of those who have been created in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retranslated, to the attention of those who could not travel.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation for rats turns to polemic
At the beginning of the week, a family left her apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building because of the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and its three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken excessive proportions, says Joël Canapa, the Director of the Office.
Rats have always been in towns.
The disastrous company makes two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene at our expense at every request of the inhabitants.
This has been the case with 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats are not pulling into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, although for two rats, one child will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats home," defended the family father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We're soon without the money and we're waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rate has affected the decline of the dollar in the face of the yen, detrimental to export values and warning about its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) at 14 201.57 and Topix gave 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony fell from over 11% to 1.668 yens.
A house prey of flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that triggered Friday noon in the Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
Over 30 firefighters were expelled on 9 on Hebert Street.
The flames were reported in a house of three dwellings on four floors located behind the Quebec Seminar court.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firemen, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings attached here," explained France Loiselle, the speaker of Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York was the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremonist at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was more recently resumed by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of the posters have emerged in Carolines, and have experienced great success, until they have become too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a show and music evening for the former fighters, organized at the Madison Square Garden, with Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown wide, just like the world of the comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have been held through non-traditional circuits, for example by presenting shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of the FXX Fantasy Fantasy Football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" program and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is still more famous for her "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On" virus video series.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with the unique voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the Irish defender of Racial Justice W. Kamau Bell), are purely products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main factors for the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedy, but he became a successful film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land program called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The appointment takes place at the Hotel de Ville, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and thought, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come to live here.
Oil price continues to fall and closes $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the size of stocks were compensating a report showing that the Chinese electricity industry is strengthening.
The US reference gross price for delivery in December fell from $14 cent to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a decrease of 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed the price over the last few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, showing activity growth, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been experienced in the past two decades.
Gross Brent, a reference for international gross used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to $18.58 the barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Rejection of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal in Texas restored certain restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy that had been blocked by a first instance judge this week.
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that State, which largely jeopardizes the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
The judgment given by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVGs will have to have a "privilege of admission" from local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his status as a health care member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
The defenders of the GIV argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of the state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a first instance judge had considered the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission as anti-constitutional at the time of the entry into force of the Act.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who cuts the governor's position, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the first instance judgment that blocked the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a return to force on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV post, or 5.6% in the audience.
But was the show on the date?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves at the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, the viewers shared their comments.
Passed the excitement to recover their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually marked this first award.
As every year, the first hearing programs have a wide range of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some of them found their account there.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even have gone to the end.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of successful singers are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD's control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed it from the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the appeal brought by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed to its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a supervisor to assist the police department in changing its policy and the training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments concerning the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be dismissed because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which it responded publicly to the Court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of persons by wrongly targeting black men of Hispanic origin as part of their control and search programme.
She appointed an external supervisor to supervise changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body-based cameras in areas where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after police checks.
The hearing of the appeal by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and search has been criticized by many defenders of civil rights.
This control and search system has existed in a certain form for decades, but the number of checks registered has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks mainly involving black and Hispanic men.
In 2004, a judicial action was initiated by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
The supporters of changes in the NYPD's control and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, will have more effective police forces and trust them, and will change the way police departments use politics.
The opponents say that these changes would undermine the morality of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after the number of police officers has been severely reduced over the last decade.
The judge stressed that it did not put an end to constitutional control and search practices, but reformed the way in which the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must go to vote because each of them pays on average $100 a month on the housing price that goes to taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, it divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would deal with the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us fireworks at $100,000, lands of $4 to $5 million in case...
Go to vote, that's the best way to express you and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the cook of Elysée
In the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens that had been carried out after working in embassies, the cook graved all levels until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday spots, and fed an incalculable number of big ones in this world in a quasi anonymity that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at the age of 60.
The man with open face, the skull degarned and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin is owner of a pastry CAP.
His mother herself was cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I passed from one castle to the other!" ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he has acted, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of the state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in Elysée's kitchens!
It is not a matter for Heads of State who showed a relative indifference to earthly food, "they are all gourmands," bitterly denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had "a bit more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were empty again!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who recovered the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no application for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the State dinners in Elysée: "we have to serve between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The previous night is almost white.
Those people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of Elysée, who took a drink Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pincement in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in the Old Quebec Friday noon.
The building of four accommodations, located on 15 rue Hébert, was subject to three alarms from the fire department.
The fire declared itself in front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson of the Quebec Fire Protection Service, stated that the rapid intervention of firemen has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built closely.
The fired house had four accommodations, but no tenants were on the spot at the time of the fire.
Damage was limited, even if water caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin, but the sappers have removed the thesis of a criminal act.
Wall Street Wolf: exit from the second trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves a few pictures of his next film, whose role-title, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to take you off in his role as a defiant trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Fellowship, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a large case of corruption in Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then climbed up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascension, but also the dizziness falling that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess in any way are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them on Shutter Island.
The exit of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long installation.
It seems that the film lasts at last at 2.45 pm.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bow pipe on a connection involving the Minister of the Interior then in office, Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the Court of Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "small special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate Pawlby's voicebox and to "stop the door constantly," but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay before the house of people by hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love presenting history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, monitoring, it can not be different.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say, "Of course, yes."
The rumors about a relationship involving Clarke were first taken over by the NotW editorial office when a source, having a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which vocabulary messages pirated on his phone were recorded at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer concerning Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised Miss Pawlby's monitoring of the minor facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow, which I really would like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself was with the co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to pirate phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to have done phone hacking.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The President of the United States was to receive Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, 1 November 2013, seeking help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most murderous month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 injured.
The United Nations has an even higher balance sheet with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violences are becoming increasingly murderous despite enhanced security measures and large military operations launched for months by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, the level of violence is fearing a new occurrence, while the neighbouring Syria is prone to a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are killed in the middle of the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unfair arrests, has promoted this flame of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped north of Baghdad.
A large part of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (Sunnian extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of the United States interviews of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, December 12, 2011.
At that time, the American president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and Congress elected.
On Thursday, he advocated that the international community conduct a "third World War" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a chit, who attributed him the partial responsibility for the recovery of violence by his "sektural and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the perverting influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses a hearing group of Tiananmen's attack
On Friday, the head of the Chinese domestic security accused a Xinjiang U.S. separatist group for being behind the captured car attack that killed five people on the Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, was darkened on the crowd that was located on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and fired its three passengers and two passers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office responsible for internal security, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many audiences, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are driven by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premediated," said Meng at the Phoenix TV Hong Congaise TV.
"The group that stood in the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, saying by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he was of august origin and specified that his wife and mother were in the car with him.
It also contained tanks filled with gasoline and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident hurt 42 people.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican surveys contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce and couples formed from the same sex.
The survey asked the participants how priests took care of gay couples and their children, and how they treated men and women who lived together without being united by marriage ties.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instructions to obtain as many responses as possible.
The information will be used for an important family gathering that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesman of the United States Catholic Bishops Conference confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to explore the parishes.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacked the last rebel fief
The irreductibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were cut off at nearly 2000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," told the AFP a resident of Jomba, joined by phone around 12:30, and according to which a girl was wounded by bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of the confrontations has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have dismissed the rebels a little."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before climbing to the front for a "running operation".
There was a very clear hearing behind him of slight weapons-feedings.
From Bunagana, the political fief and the last strong position of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the Democratic Republic of China, the battles entered "in a final phase", the FARDC having "encircled the remaining positions of the M23 to decommission them".
Since the resumption, Friday, of confrontations between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fights, but it provides government troops with decisive support in the field of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozens of soldiers, well equipped with ammunition, climbed towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalachnikov and rockets.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, the border post with Uganda, civilian-assisted soldiers loaded a multiple rocket launch mounted on a FARDC's nine-flamming truck, to ensure the lifting of another machine piling the M23 positions on the hills.
On Wednesday evening, the Congolese President Joseph Kabila called again the rebels to "demobilize themselves voluntarily" in a painful effort to be disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing without results since December.
On the spot, M23's political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, only in Uganda's mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without that information being confirmed immediately from the government side.
M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which contradict Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of convoyed mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had been refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return to the DRC that had started in the morning turned back at midday.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to retreat," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by its nine children, including an infant on the back.
We have the impression that the shootings are closer to the populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Musical comedy, this scene beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, singed and danced productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
It is a revolution: French music is confirmed as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts would be ridiculous.
And successes such as Cabaret or The Miserables wore the mystery's aureol.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the gift.
Today, these two scenes treat titles as successful tubes.
The first takes over this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady, and announces for the next World Creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, music shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comics such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are taking the lead of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Musical Comics" and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the so hard conquered success.
How are French musical comedies changing?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical spectacles" that evolve at the will of the producers...
Some use beautiful images projections and a true story like in 1789, the Bastille lovers.
Others make a 15-year jump back under the pretext that you can serve about anything when you have Matt Pokora in the poster head.
Afterwards, we have the musical comics with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us revive Broadway's gold age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes anglo-saxon musical comics by adapting them to French.
Independent French producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Woman's Spider Bath" or "The Spring Wake" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, playing and dancing, like Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn from projects to projects.
In the United States, the beard of the musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The leverage of talent is as important as the number of posts to be filled.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this lack.
These are the same young people who like telereality and what it produces as ephemerous stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) in the headline of a musical show is the assurance of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are carefully held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise climbed to Paris and tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all major France halls in the same shape as Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident made a serious injury, Friday morning around 5:30 p.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in direction of Waterloo.
The driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free to him.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9:00 p.m., at the location of the accident, the time the road is deactivated and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, has not caused much congestion because the accident took place at Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be deviated by this exit/input of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old has been severely injured as a result of an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates des Caraïbes".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: the army is preparing a new attack
Children play on a carbonized M23 rebel armor in Kibumba, October 31, 2013, East of the DRC.
On Friday, the Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last M23 bastions of the rebels near Bunagana, east of the DRC.
The aim is to delocate the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from itself.
There will be no more than the Runyonyi hill.
"The Chanzu is not very strategic," said the Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, to the AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of rebellion, this place is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducible M23, are cut off at nearly 2,000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby village of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fights throughout the day on Thursday said that the situation was " calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the day before and buried.
One girl was wounded with a bullet, and three other people were wounded, including a severely evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have not reported any loss of human lives.
The revelations of the NSA increase the paranoidity of companies with regard to State supervision
By a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On order of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American front post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
The German media explains that the BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation created an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of American intelligence services, again stressed in September that the United States did not use foreign intelligence capabilities to "rob the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or gain."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a declarant, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of the United States' surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the Director on word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency spyed on the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data held by American storage services providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused companies to be paranoid in state surveillance.
The revelation that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vase unload.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States represents as much a risk as China in the field of industrial spying and data robbery, according to a survey published in July by the EY Consultative Office.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication so far that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern about the fact that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German Parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"This is not the right way to do," says Hasso Plattner, President of the German Business Software Company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophisticatedness of the American spying agencies exposed to Snowden's revelations were shocked by some companies who until then thought China was the biggest surveillance risk.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European officials have realized that the data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-American members have renounced their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the US Prism Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snape, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients today ask us a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at any cost.
It is not surprising that there is economic spying.
There's always been.
"This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the BASF chemical producer company.
The Americans spy on us in both commercial and industrial terms, as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, in the event that this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been marteling the message that it is at least inconspicuous to recover a free USB stick in a professional living room or to leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, states that the collection of mobile phones before the board's meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on travel abroad due to the risk of breach of smartphone integrity.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their special niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV informed in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic spying activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted by the United States in February cite France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty of second-degree acts of hacking economic information behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic spying, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former French intelligence director, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services are well aware that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in unusual circumstances think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a rolled fighter carpet at his high school gymnasium, thought their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a carpet standing behind the gymnasium gradins of his high school.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family contested those conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
"They think that this challenges any logic, the laws of physics and the common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered solely to cover the persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cartridge and they returned it to them in a mortar bag," he added.
The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions were unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow up on the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis for opening an official investigation," he said.
Moore told the journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if it reveals evidence that warrants a civil or criminal investigation of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the office of the Sheriff of Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to return all video surveillance records that had been examined by the investigators.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that video images would contain hints on the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on children's allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has increased sharply.
A 20-year-old in the United States now suffers from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of and how to treat the educational body and staff to food allergies in children in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen brand self-injector – to respond quickly in cases of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with an allergic reaction.
The children can say, "I feel like something steals my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have stitches on my tongue."
The NSA case underscores the total absence of a discussion on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on one side, is offensive in public by calling on the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and on the other hand, prohibits the overfly of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on his side of Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius summons the ambassador of the United States, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of US surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World at a few weeks interval on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a conviction of the NSA's Quai d'Orsay listening?
Wouldn't there be a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that enables each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the sail on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of the US power, this constitutes an important lighting.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any case for us to take this practice, it is for us to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we take away American collaboration?
The establishment of very powerful technology tools for interception by the United States, but also by France, has been formally justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States have, in particular, established procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described as essential on the one hand.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be driven, for example, to transmit whole data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been quickly said - the Americans can provide French with information about other regions of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not both the ability or the right of countries to provide themselves with interception tools, and the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the scope which must be theirs, and ultimately the question of violations of freedoms.
What are the real risks of the United States?
Well, we've got to declare them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk run by the Americans may be double.
The first is when their allies - and that has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, were monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have developed.
Another effect can be more economic: increasingly European or South American companies, in the light of disclosures, are reluctant to confide their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws, and thus to the takeover of the NSA.
Last element: the wide movement of disclosures undertaken by media around the world, which contributes to the launch of a debate on the practices of the surveillance of intelligence services until then almost in existence, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexed children can choose "indefinite sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be severely attributed to their birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children, allowing them to include "undefined" or "unspecified" sex in their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take prompt decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersexual persons.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, contusioned and sparkled.
It is estimated that a child of 2,000 born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexuality being part of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term denouncing people with chromosomes or gonades (ovarians or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersexed children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgical action, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science that consists of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why.
It's like the mystery surrounding homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgenic persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither the one of a man nor the one of a woman alone, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either of them.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, puffiness, chest and statue), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of discrimination against intersexual and transgenic persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young non-compliant boys now have camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to include male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized "neutral" after having won her appeal trial that allowed her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersexuals, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still being controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators of this land- Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "Gene Theory" from school books.
The American Catholic Online site has also opposed the German law, writing that "because the world is dragged into a new rule where genre is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are being overturned."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer sex to be assigned to babies when they were born.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a dozen years ago, the medical community considered the genre to be a slate, which can be erased and on which we can retrieve.
But now many are those who question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of the treatment of children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the genre malleable.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and supported that social and environmental signals – the way in which parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sliced circumcision to cast him completely, by also removing the testicles, and to raise him like a girl.
" Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he returned to a boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors "everytime repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones when she was 12 years old.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realised that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found out terrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDS) that prevented her body from producing enough testosterone to enable her sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he returned to a man, following a testosterone treatment and was removed from his breasts.
Surgery made it sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersexual persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director General of the Non-Profit Organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "invits labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their children "undetermined sex", she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law as "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex name."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law will "responsibly" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of Katie's anthrogen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or carrying mothers.
"The law leaves parents some flexibility so that they don't have to take urgent decisions," said Baratz.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a period before entering "man" or "woman".
So everything is fine – you can raise your child and love her.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being parent.
You don't have to hurry for surgery that is irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what needs to be done," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of its government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right within the coalition in power at the approach of the Senate vote to discard Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview in the daily La Stampa, the left-wing leader says he has "closely the intention" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The Italian Parliament's High Chamber will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw its support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, declares its disobedience.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2nd, his refusal to give up the orders of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring the cabinet down.
L.A. Times reports that an agent from the United States Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the shooting exchange.
Firemen called at the scenes of the tragedy said they had responded to a call stating "multiple wounded".
"The order forces are on the spot," says the airport on its Twitter account, while TV images were showing evacuated persons in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," said AFP a spokesperson of the American Transportation Safety Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a brancard, and a second carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 p.m. local (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that teminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
TSA spokesperson was unable to immediately confirm whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli chariot fires killed a Palestinian Islamist activist from Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, learned from health services sources.
A source from Hamas explained that there have been battles in this region, because Israeli chariots have crossed the border and have been targeted by your Palestinian mortals.
The Israeli army simply referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a "terrorist" tunnel by the Hebrew state, buried at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secret, to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event in the 2012 campaign book of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, " Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to be published and told on Thursday evening that the close colleagues of the President had conducted "in-depth work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama with his reelection while his hopes were weakening.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign leaders and the White House, the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the impact of the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State Clinton on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been frankly kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers of the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former advisers at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the task of replacing Biden, despite their "short personal links," before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list did not significantly improve the chances of Obama's success.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley to the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the President was not in shape, and so we thought, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the "concerted" exam, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the reelection campaign had invested a lot to find out whether the change would be beneficial in the election.
"Campings don't spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously intend to take action," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of any change.
Although Daley said that he did not think the president was "informed" about the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that " Double Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether political surveys had arrived at the Obama office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know that Biden's eviction from the presidential list was examined.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on meduse.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous collation.
He had the idea of this after reading a study on meduses and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically re-create the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since the ice cream starts to spark when it reacts to the warmth of the mouth, the more you slick, the more it becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something unbelievable but we're only at the beginning of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language with neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice begins to shine.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the lighting of the meduses is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about 140 £.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach based in Bristol is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do so.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, while he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st Tai chi movement, with his hands of musicians shining the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to take her out of the hospital and take her to her home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're a city, it's our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the great joy of living that he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, to go to bed late and to dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pencil.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I certainly won't do that any more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the gallow sheep when you're talking about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in candy, dresses and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trend.
Clothing is expected to amount to $1.2 million out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are annoying.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
With regard to men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet Daft Punk space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought dresses are zombies, Batman, pirates and witchcraft.
I guess there's no problem staying traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, at my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans will spend $330 million on animal dressing this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't sneak.
The Americans will spend $1.9 million on candy this year, according to Nielsen's firm.
This represents about 272 million kg Hershey bars, sucks, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million children who are hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the American Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, don't tell us stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confections Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't come to clarify yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the hanted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million of recipes, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these amazing photos of you pissing you on that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a guy that you like well leave a comment on the "good head" style.
Finally, let's talk about citrushes.
Charlie Brown presented us The Big Citrouille when we were young, and sculpting a lantern-shaped cutter, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we've been very young.
Fortunately for us, the "trend of the baby-circle" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have sculpted these potterons and didn't have to sit in it.
This year, the Americans will spend approximately $106 million in crawls, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pineapples that slowly flew on the porch of your house probably came from the Illinois, where 542 million pinapples were cultivated this year.
If you're looking for more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg crayon.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a bad bank deficiency structure comprising £38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its resumption.
The bank wants to reduce the share of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it in the next three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciation of doubtful additional claims of GBP 4 to 4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the formation of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its capacity to lend.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would be able to draw a mark on the past, since the government was particularly accused of intervening in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that are a really good bank and build a great bank for customers and the United Kingdom," said the new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has 6-point baquet seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options are improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works Mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally amateurs join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallyes in the UK and international, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of raid rallyes.
We have had a great pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will really be great."
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North and Middle East Africa.
Firemen were called to save a lost puppet after being stuck at 15 m above the ground on an unstable corniche in a career
Ruby, a cocky snake, escaped after a road accident without seriousness
She was detected three days later by a person who walked her dog stuck in the career
The firefighters descended as a reminder along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from a certain death
A puppie had the chance to escape from the worst after the firemen were called to safely recover it while he was penetrated at 15 m above the ground on the unstable shelf of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month cowboy, escaped after an accident on the road Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, travelled to the career of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social network sites after she disappeared in career following a serious accident.
Around 14.15 a.m. on Wednesday, a person with a sharp view who walked his dog saw Ruby on a corniche in the career, trapped 15 m above the ground.
A technical relief team from the Cleckheaton fireplace went down to the site and came down as a reminder to save Ruby by using an animal yard to transport it up to the cliff.
Andy Clayton, a technical relief specialist, said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely didn't move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits after that.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
The technical relief specialist Peter Lau said, "Ruby had a lot of chance to get out of it freely."
She could have been severely injured or worse.
Ruby was driven to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, except exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by observing relief."
I didn't think she was upstairs.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had flushed, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dragged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was choirist on the song of Jagger 'old Habits Die Hard' in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He dragged me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said that he "remained categorically to have made advances to Katy Perry".
The representative added, "Maybe she confuses it with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to perform on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, landed in the first place of charts this week.
Beijing initiates a Turkish Islamic Movement
"Close support for the attack came from the Eastern Islamic Turkestan Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the leader of the Chinese security bodies at a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Chinese Communist Party Political Office (PCC), spoke to Tachkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese responsible designates a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uïghours of the same Muslim-dominant Xinjiang family, bordered several countries of Central Asia, crashed their gasoline tank car against the entry of the prohibited City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that made two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car.
The Etim, which declares itself to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, the former Chinese Xinjiang name, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is doubted by several experts.
George Kerevan: The splendour of Europe gives the choice to the Scottish
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time we are told that an independent Scotland would have to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the Hadrian wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper has indicated the potential economic impact of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the large titles (and it was to be predicted).
Nor did anyone say that the EU Member States devoted much of their time to circumventing their formal rules when they arranged them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scotland.
This is therefore a story that is not a story.
And a story so old that it is now fictional: I heard for the first time that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why trade the London yoke with the Brussels yoke, especially now?
This is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitively dead.
With the crisis in the euro, the Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, the parties who oppose the EU or militate for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes at the Federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan weighing on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has not much to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has placed its members in favour of German exporters – what German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe face a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas as the United States.
This is a editorial disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by a cheap American skid gas.
As a result, the revolt is one of the main leaders of the EU, especially in France.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and setting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy in trouble.
Result: Marine Le Pen's extreme right-wing party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot go from the principle that a division of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
She wants to use the European elections next year to create a single and anti-European monetary bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like "the Europe of Nations (sovereign)" freely privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will return their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope that it will make its eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels to walk.
I believe that Scotland could accede to a more free European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a Non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – and that is to be noted – the anti-Austéria political movement that has been the most successful in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark coups proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Party, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democrat coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing earlier
Studies show that African and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
CNN's former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a specialist in family and health issues in children.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's pub breasts and hair begin to grow to 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassured parents – generally, this does not indicate a rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Evident signs of development, such as bobbing of breasts, hair under the arms and in the pub area and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half, while the age was 12 three quarters in 1970.
"When the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate on what is the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a paediatric can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify endocrinologist tests to remove serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone ageing that can inhibit growth and small sizes at adult age.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medicines but recognizes that "controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others".
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They are afraid of the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter had her first rules when she was 10 years old.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the scared and upset school to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible assumption is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted in girls aged 6 to 9 that binds the percentage of fat to the trigger of puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms appear to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pub area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pub hair is common, even in infants and infants.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask for advice from their paediatrics to find out how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will respond well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The homage to the people of Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Festival of Cannes, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that just started to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filming has just been the subject of a retrospective to the French Cinemathèque, had rafted the Gold Palme in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of the ability to hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their dedication on the American star, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this full of humour film where music is a central character and the songs interpreted live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to a musician and singer of folk accomplished, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
With Carey Mulligan, she left the rich surroundings of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less reluctant clothing, a gentle voice when she sings, but the sworn sworn to the gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't perpetuate and get angry with the whole earth.
He accepts backwards the replacements lifted in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of his friends' sofas who still want to receive it.
A Documentary Air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of unfortunateness, a guy who is not here at the right time, who is not carnivorist but integrity, with self-destructive behaviour," said Ethan Coen, who was crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time, such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would produce international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk wrote.
The film then takes documentary presentations, the buzzy music label invaded by 33T invaded by an old unpaid secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the coffee shops where the singers were performing.
The magic of Coen brothers still operates by incorporating a funny character who crosses the film continuously: a beautiful red cat with a scratching look, a companion of Llewyn Davis's fortune.
Questioned about how he composed his character, the actress and singer Justin Timberlake had reminded him of "growing in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first lessons of music were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "the chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, the star pop explains that in a career, "the most important is not to be caught by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He never knew the word 'retirement'.
Phenomena of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, was just about to publish his 200th SAS, "La vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it to it as "the writer of spy novels who knew too much of it".
He spent ten days in Afghanistan, the 198th and 199th opus theatre of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gérard de Villiers, born 8 December 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 and 150 million confused countries," he made progress last March.
His birman cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building of the Foch Avenue, two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, denouncing a pile of books on the lower table between the bronzes or ivories reported from 130 lands that were stuck to find their novels there.
For the price of a package of cigarettes, the reader has the right to traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with the advantageous chest, wearing a gun or attack gun.
Inside, his serenissime oldest (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian disargented aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches himself at the trousers of all the wicked of the earth, communists from the 1970s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zeste of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim of being a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "like the great reporters of the pre-war, Albert London type, who went on site and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS' father said, "Make a kind of geopolitical sheet."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of its SAS are often precedented: so, one month before the attack of a command centre of the Syrian regime who killed several senior leaders, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command centre in this city, a brick of Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the murder of Egyptian president Anouar El-Satate in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I am not guessing, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and sometimes some of my assumptions are realizing.
After these trips in often disturbed areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM to marguerite writing machine dating from 1976 "of which all the coins were changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
At the walls of his office are hanging guns of attack AK-47, erotic photos and pictures of the author with African warlords.
Regularly stuck for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome to Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said, "Malko Linge, like all the heroes, has no age."
He won't die and he won't retire.
Not more than me.
Airplanes are struggling about the width of the seats while large controls are at stake
The dispute between the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on the long-court flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautical fair that takes place this month.
The conflict relates to the width of the proposed seats on long-court flights for passengers in the economic class – which are not always the most shortened by airlines, but to which space is essential to increase efficiency in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard for a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but his great American rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out while the airplanes are seeking to sell even larger versions of their bimotor aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be placed at the back of the aircraft – in particular if there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" can accommodate 406 people in economic class in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitor version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economic class in 18 inch large seats configured in 9 rows.
Aeronautics giants often exchange shots on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Aeronautical Lounge, where the 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financials of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant, entitled "Do you accept that?"
"Boeing offers long-run flights in narrower seats than in regional turbo-drivers," said John Leahy, Airbus commercial director.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's 747 jumbo defined the modern long-courrier journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight increased by 10 per cent from 40 to 49 years, according to data from the American Department of Health.
The average American tower of the 21st century is 39,7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival is attached to a seat concept dating from the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly called "jet set" aircraft was narrower.
Airbus adds that she ordered a study that indicates that an additional thumb in the width of the seats would improve the quality of sleep of 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus' figures regarding the width of seats and claims that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that the cabin experience was not just dependent on the width of the seats.
"It's really about providing airlines with flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more and more a matter of freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a flight order race for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at market price in the coming decades, enough to raise the US and European export balance.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim an output per seat in their latest long-courrier bimotor models 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends partly on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows 9.
The increase in unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this to be able to break more seats and make his planes more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Confort Passager Director at the European Airbus Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers vote for a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
"A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the inside cabin expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
The airplane vendors who are around the world take even one metre with them to check the competing configurations.
While seeking to offer comfortable devices, all manufacturers also offer airplanes with high density configurations for low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more personalization of cabins by offering broader side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large equipment, experts say that it is unlikely that his appeal to the aerospace industry to establish a size standard for seats will be achieved, but that it could make it forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and director-general Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but comes to the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just overwhelmed by the victory of his boat at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had already received a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss renounced a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the poor performance of the group, which failed its growth goals, but he received approximately $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Of the entire decelerated year 2013, the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5%, while the Börse price was 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine dependence in life.
Other tests are needed before starting human testing, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies trace all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having a dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccined mice that then were given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated were "simpled," said the researchers, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the magazine Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections should be repeated so often that the levels of antibodies remain high that they were too expensive and less practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this can help them lose their bad habits," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but reported that much more detailed research was needed.
The head of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a blow by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, learned from the security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But those responsible for intelligence, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, conducted in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The next day, the Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, traveling to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been held with the Pakistani Taliban Tehrik (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi never be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be investigated by the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi denied that he had changed the trade policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation to see if Mr. Obeid had put pressure on several State ministers to renew his blazes in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and one coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any invitation to tender.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions initiated in 2005, the government made pressure to ensure that bids were awarded.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, Circular Quay's companies, which reported to Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any bidding.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported tenders.
However, he denied that he had changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy in the area of blasphemy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Port Department after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Did the topic discussed during these phone conversations be the development of the commercial lease policy?", asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't that.
At least not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says a responsible
Israeli warplanes have reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday night, confirms a military officer at Fox News.
The person responsible did not specify the target, but said that there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel led air strikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The Government is currently studying the possibility of establishing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa of 457 while considering extending the repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied on the basis of a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled posts or as a misleading way to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today when the Labour Member Maxine McKew declared the government speech on foreign workers, saying that he could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The horrifying statements about the "returning to the end" and "jobs for the Australians first" are a displeasing return when the trade unions asked for a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region view it as an echo to this historical artefact.
The working paper reports on the 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out "if the job offer is authentic in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the company that sponsors it".
Businesses could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seekers would have died of a heart attack after arrival on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The angry son of the man, 9 years old, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was immediately transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and northern England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Baron Kramer, Minister of Transport, said that the project would "assemble the United Kingdom".
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown said "enthusiastic" to the idea of working with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government reviewed the estimated cost of building the high-speed connection between London and northern England, ranging from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The British Government, which is in discussions with Transport Scotland, has requested HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the journey duration for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel periods between Glasgow and Edinburgh from a maximum of three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will be closer to the United Kingdom and its cities."
We push the HS2 project because its benefits are enormous.
Without him, we are faced with a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "unambiguously" support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight in the global high-speed rail network project across the UK.
"We are therefore excited about working in partnership with the British Government to consider options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps."
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down their tablets and smartphones during the start-up and landing despite the United States' gesture to facilitate the regulation of electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to American carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "avion mode".
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to access their electronic books during the start-up and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that obliges American carriers to carry out significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"Casa does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft devices," she said.
This is the subject of a regulation which requires aircraft operators to ensure continuous security and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said that it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of the CASA which would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve customer experience now that we have (from the entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas said that she currently respected the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transport programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to shut off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavyer devices be safely placed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a 30-person revolt according to the evidence collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rice involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four light wounds would be regrettable.
Alerts, the gendarmes visited the site to separate the belligerents and ensure that the injured were taken care of.
Singapur lenders benefit from the middle-class constraints to tighten the belt
Janani Amirthalinga puts a bracelet, a ring and a pair of golden earrings at a lender from the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay the tuition fees for her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money went in there," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore (2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, her monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, in some parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – the demand is such that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, has become the third payroll loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Making jewelry money is not just a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unguaranteed bank loans.
In general, lenders on pay in Singapore collect an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund leasing company with a branch in the same trading centre.
However, lenders on pay have the advantage of not asking for a solvency or pay proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to lenders on pay, while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit powered by a too laxistic monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to lenders on payroll to fill the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency mentioned the growing household debt, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest gross domestic household debt ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, while the rate was 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical downturn this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuous weak export and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the increase in costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are seeking to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people pressing to pay for their personal properties to touch the value of their jewels in cash.
In Singapore, approximately 70 per cent of the items used in the 200 state-owned loan shops are in gold.
People say, "the price of gold is high, let's put the grandmother's gold chain on the floor and we'll get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest lending shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its lending shops over the past few months.
The increase in the lending sector is such that ValueMax, a shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops such as this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, its Director General.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week when it introduced to the Singapore Fellowship.
While some low-cost lenders have wiped out the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yes indicates that payout offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but also that she does not directly increase debt.
"Clients mortgage assets that they already own, and the fact that they have their personal assets does not increase household debt," she said.
Payroll is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term funding.
Those who go to payroll lenders are not only those who have financial problems.
People in Singapore also go to ValueMax loan shops to pay for gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all levels of society.
"This may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who have cash needs to go through a difficult target," Ms. Yes adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region in Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he worked.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was acting, said he was deeply attracted by this news.
In a communiqué, the church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes into Nazi uniform to the supermarket before being chased
A man dressed with a Nazi uniform barbed by a brass with the gammed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the direction of the establishment that called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesman of the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police at the rescue, but "the time she arrived, he had already gone without swinging," she added.
I was driving the queue when I saw a woman that seemed upset.
People were mouthd.
"You don't go out on the street like this unless you wanted to draw attention," said a 60-year-old customer, Rosina Rusin, at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of Halloween's party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a candlestick.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I wear a black SS brass twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania's health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the vacancy health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent MEP of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our opinion, will resolve the unique difficulties facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgence surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help to recover delays.
Funds are also provided for untreated clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training medical managers, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first-line clinicians, this is the best way to cure Tasmania's health system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would be confronted with a strict reporting and reporting regime.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate the Tasmania public health system".
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to the removal of Tasmania's public health system from the black list," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the State, these additional not urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But the spokesman of the opposition on health Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "a fortune solution".
"The reason we are here is that the government's labour government has removed $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government that cuts almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and pretends it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux to Denis Diderot's novel takes a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough restoration of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
She departed in France of the 1760s and told the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent into a monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the cruelty without the limit of a supreme sadist Mother deliberately and becomes a subject of erotic fascination for another.
The film never throws into lubrication or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscious solemnity of narrative could also become a penitentance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, states the monitoring body
Syria has destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the International Chemical Weapons Surveillance Agency Thursday, while violent confrontations were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents were supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also stated on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived with one day in advance on the deadline for the
November 1 by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and for filling ammunition.
The completion of the essential phase of initial destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made when the battles were raging in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, has a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of activists, following the evolution of human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Among them, there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad had died, of which 18,678 were combatants of the pro-governmental forces and 187 activists of Lebanese Hezbollah.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and about 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad troops have fought against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to Al-Qaida network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fights stressed the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors while they had to complete their mission, namely to remove Syria from its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within tight time.
An OPCW statement, which worked closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with the fact that it had controlled – and destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling".
She added that "no other inspection activities were currently planned".
Earlier in the week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to security concerns, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPCW said that the two sites, according to Syria, were " abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
"I welcome the moral force and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Uzumcu, Director General, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the alauite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a major explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Colère caused by the punishment against one of Bali's bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the attacks of Bali in 2002 responded with anger to the sentence pronounced against the last conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution peloton.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years running away as one of the most sought-after men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosive equipment used during the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killing for attacks against two nightclubs in Kuta's popular tourist district, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many wounded.
He was also convicted of many other indictors in relation to terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a life imprisonment sentence, but they could have asked that the man, called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions by Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the side of the tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be dragged in front of the execution peloton," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a car parked outside, exploded just after 23:00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze fired a backpack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into the coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times when he was in respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have had the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Passing 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurt hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the U.S. forces will kill the former chief of Al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that reports from the intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden to restore links between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't go," said Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed sharply at the grief he could have caused to other people.
The verdict was issued on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Corteen.
However, Patek can appeal for his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but don't make a call with their mobile phone)
Airlines' passengers can use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to speak on their mobile phone – under the new highly awaited guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, said the Director of the FAA Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew members training manuals and equipment storage rules to be in conformity.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are one of the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them off until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft lands before landing and do not turn them off until the plane lands.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, said the FAA.
Most new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy with these changes.
"When the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for this – it will benefit everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this question.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to place their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game to which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled with great noise from an American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavyer devices like laptops will always have to be rowed because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during the start and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, National Transport Safety Expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile telephone antennas if they were used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased over the past few years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no safety reasons for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transport FM radios, the high-tech gadget of then.
New line aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also better resist interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft should allow greater use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emits much lower power transmissions than previous generations of devices.
Electronic books readers, for example, only emits minimum transmissions when you turn a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices fax or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who are pressing for a softening of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders commissioned a liner of Kindle electronic book readers and sent it to fly to see if there were any problems, but there were no.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of equipment presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee stated that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to turn off their devices during landings to the instruments under conditions of low visibility.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for sound arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird helished from a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helished after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water rod was lifted on board a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was put on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue centre of Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the centre, said: "This water rod was probably a winter migrator from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have succeeded in finding refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water rod was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing business together and defining what wealth and jobs creaters want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we ordered the broadest and most complete investigation from the British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, representing all sizes of companies, sectors and regions in Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than engaging in the long and round process of reform of the European institutional arcans.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreeing.
Finally, and what is more important, our survey of business leaders has revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain pursue the initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that restores power to the United Kingdom.
The challenges are high – to achieve a change in the Treaty and to better represent the interests of Great Britain would see a 16% change in the vote in favour of maintaining the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt a single moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to re-negotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that re-negotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in the UK and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses, this means once again focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not deviate from Halloween's tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed friandises to hundreds of children invited to the White House Gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween's festivals on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of the Sandy Hurricane.
This year, the feasts caught themselves.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the Greenwich village district.
Everyone's excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I could finally wear the suit I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan party celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline is inaugurating a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event has taken place today: construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest major project in Europe," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should allow for diversification of export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart from Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes," said the Director.
Miller added that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated forever.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project will be launched in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, retrieving information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambia archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area is 47 km2 if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinets of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozens of residents, most of the descendants of the mutinites of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income is 95% dependent on London's generosity.
The island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant to the Mayor of the island went to London to request Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, mayor of Pitcairn, believes that creating such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuate these 836,000 km2, however, provided that it had the means to monitor them, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
With regard to France, it already has to carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia ZEE, next to Pitcairn.

Life prison for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former Deputy Governor of the province of Jilin, in the northeast of China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having affected more than 19 million yuans of vine-pots, reports the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, assisted companies and responsible in obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared the first Beijing intermediate court on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon constituted a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former leaders of the Petrochina Petrochina oil giant.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having addressed the highest functions in the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party organization.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against Caringbah's educator Jonathan Lord in 2011, during a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Addiction on Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that "it had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression against children within its organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was interviewed with two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, Advisor to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of opening of the YMCA was incorrect, stressing that "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second most bad assessments on four institutions during an audit of the quality of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violations of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years imprisonment.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevents staff from reporting Lord's failures to the safety of children.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was framed by Lord and who had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behaviour, stated that she found the childhood service manager of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who was framing Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superiors.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationships they had with Lord confused their judgement, which makes them not report his actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his view before the Council of the YMCA of New Wales of the South saying that, for the organization, the lesson from the " Jonathan Lord incident" should not relate to "signalling" by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed in it, namely between 2009 and 2011, declared the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone from the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "grave problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to Prime Minister, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man made his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to return to the Prime Minister's position, Mr. Blair would have answered, according to the London Event Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may happen, so..."
When many experts in horseback events met in Cardiff to fight and win the Horse Trophy of the Year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weaponry, the baby and pony Shetland Toffee took the three towers with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition in the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Behavioured against elegant melon hats men and women, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a relaxed way to make his 2-year-old Toffee poney roll around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his uncommon natural training qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for her presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland poney every day.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent duo."
They presented themselves against and against all, but both of them scratched the golden cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in horseback competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it."
He passed all the length of the track running and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
In the way he started, he will probably soon participate in the event of the Horse of the Year – and I am sure he will make a great performance.
A spokesman of the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his poney."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well presenting and how they walked on the track.
They are looking for an effective team work between the poney and the coach – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be retransformed"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be retransformed, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted pots-de-vin to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "complete change," said the regulator.
The order of "rechange" comes from Guangdon's administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, a member of the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete recast of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the persons responsible for New Express and immediately recast the newspaper management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to have published false stories against money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apologies, New Express published his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television confessions.
The specialists say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forced anyone to commit themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "indisponibility"
In Toulon, the air carrier is on the run.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear heaters in mid-October and while the boat was on the sea, was "no danger for the sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed us "the indisponibility" of the ship until mid-November, "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a defence naval specialist, ensures that its teams and Areva's teams, expelled in the Var for the occasion, "interact at the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the defective heater.
"Everything is being implemented to enable the Charles-de-Gaulle to make its deployment planned at the end of 2013," DCNS, however.
And the National Navy to certify that "this does not jeopardise the ship's activity program" with nuclear propulsion.
Let's remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier comes out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had machined from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is intended to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small avarie", concealed to the confinement space of the reactor, had then occurred on the French fleet's amiral ship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to find a great discontent from the people I have encountered: a monsterly reassessment of their properties, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to end.
In short, siphoning without limit of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved in order to allow a tax that is highly respectful for those who pay.
Any money removed from force to taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their depletion.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the sumptuous costs and the maintenance of the lousy ducks: deficiency cultural centre, high grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also regrettable to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I would like to make a honorable reference to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost do tax payers have to pay?
It is not for the public level to invest in such companies, but for the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to know that the Fishing and Piles lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the outbreak of all (great water-consumers) industries and the large decline in the population, the use of water has declined significantly across the territory.
Not to mention waste, the city will never miss water and the severe regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In summary, it is very easy to realize great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by cravates with great degrees for the most part, and I don't think a sheep grower is making worse.
Discovered a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, on an equivalent length of almost six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is filled with indefinite warehouses, which helps to easily hide trucks charged with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it unnoticedly, said the authorities.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to legal records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with purpose of sale.
They are sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment if sentenced.
In Nogales, in Arizona, traffickers exploit large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered as a result of the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, which poses a challenge for drug cartels that must deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that left the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
The British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuador Embassy in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a 40-year-old "release notice" against Australian, asking her to present herself to a police station, adding that if she did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following the allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible paths under the British law after the Supreme Court annulled the appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, asking for political asylum to this South American country.
Scotland Yard " issued a return notice against a 40-year-old man who asks him to present himself to a police station at the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to infringe the conditions of his release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the release of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Finished passwords to tap to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person conducting transactions in a transverse and transnational universe as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to privacy confirm this trend for biometrics, but are concerned.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, cantines...
"Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and anywhere," says Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in one, and pessimism, in the other?
The biometrics will be based on new technologies that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people working concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand require a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
It is both a security - it is not possible to capture these data to their unconsciousness - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
As a result, research has been conducted for twenty years on other approaches, such as the recognition of face or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the ability to calculate computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, explains Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture R & D Laboratorys in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic frontier positions using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris in motion.
"Today we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk through sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Intel Labs Security Research.
A unique and infalsible marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police a suitcase costing EUR 90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognition of one person among others) and authentication (sure that the person is the person it claims to be).
To date, the identification concerned the issue of identity documents: biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be confronted with the information that the State possesses on all citizens already listed.
This makes it possible to make sure that one person does not try to abuse the identity of someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We recover the images of the surveillance cameras and compare them with the photos of the celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," Dany Nassif, charged, at NEC France, with commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a quidam in photo that makes the queue in a store, follow his progression thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (frontiers, protected premises, cantines, etc.) or logical (opening of a computer).
It has been added, more recently, to the presence control.
"One biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who pointes for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But more and more authentication will also apply to transactions, especially those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and placing its hand on a biometric player: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and large distribution teachers: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can make time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a client stays in cash 30 seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer customized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
Finally, rest assured by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, from Thales.
But, lack of thorough studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convincing users.
Privacy specialists continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: generalized surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick, Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A wheeled driver at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs saw an almond of 1,000 £ inflated
A motorist was charged a fine of £1,000 for rolling at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the need for caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his licence led to a 6-month withdrawal of his licence.
Howie was also sentenced to pay charges of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign property owners to bubble out London
The Treasury has provisionally encrypted the capital gains tax measure but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp fee for properties costing more than £2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a company rather than individually.
The stamp right is already applicable to residential properties in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents $708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "In view of the increase in stamp rights on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-evasion law in this area, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners reluctant to the idea of selling," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 % of the highest prices of the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located southwest of London, from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by 11.8 % in last year.
Prices in central London show a regular year-on-year growth of 5.6%, but have been shrinked by a "internal market" in growth, the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's queue are linked to his mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs were moving more their queue to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimulation of positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was going on with other species.
He added that, as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to dissatisfaction of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analysed their behaviour.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their queue sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs of movies with other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we could trade the movement of the queue and present it as more left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expressing the queue to the right (from the dog's point of view that's the queue), they stayed perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a dive mainly to the left (only once from the dog's point of view that stitches the dick), their heart rate accelerated and they seemed anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other thanks to these movements.
He thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their queue to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The Canin Behaviour Expert John Bradshaw, a professor invited to the Bristol University Veterinary School, stated that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canin species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "The dogs were more easily going to a robot dog when his queue turned to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that differences could arise from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to true dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are not an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it is probably not long before we understand why their queue sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones a concert to Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngite was diagnosed to his singer.
Sheffield's group was scheduled to appear in the The Hydro concert room in the city centre on Friday.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to postpone the concert to Birmingham's LG Arena tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys should also report the show to the Hydra de Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to happen in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Hydra in Glasgow will be held on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any discomfort caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket shop where you bought your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Francis will nominate his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will nominate new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, announced the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so this is a group of 120 "voting cardinals".
In a statement proclaiming the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of the cardinal, known as the consistor.
"Peace Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Constituary in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of Cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of electors would probably have decreased.
He said that a pope in general appointed as many cardinals as needed for the number of electorate cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The consistor of next year will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis' election in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe, especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will nominate Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis has formed the Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals around the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the Pope decided by himself.
"Now François chose these eight cardinals to help her," Valero explained.
He added that he was "everything possible" that François asked cardinals to advise.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the Popes were generally elevated by bishops representing large communities in the cardinal rank, but that François was " full of surprises – so we don't know who he will appoint."
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat folder
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually inclinable files, according to a statement from the US vehicle safety regulation agency on Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the files do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards for header support.
"If the vehicle is impacted by the back, the headrest may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The reminded models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first US car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first fifteen of October.
NHTSA could not review the information letter to owners due to the 16-day arrest of government activities, which slowed down the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickup sales, which were recast for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares increased by 1.4 per cent to reach $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies enclosed under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under tens of concrete blocks, Thursday morning, in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 p.m. on the Marquette Street, near the intersection of the Beaubien Street, in the arrondissement of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
Indeed, work on the foundations had changed in this place for some time.
A mitoyan foundation wall had been built in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim just arrived at the site to recover his tools.
I walked by car and I saw the wall collapse with a large smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who stays close to the site.
I landed and went to take off the big bricks that covered it.
We saw only part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in the 50s who worked for a scam company.
Reanimation manoeuvres have been tempted by emergency services, but have not been successful.
The man didn't survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was sent to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The cry of despair from a Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, who believes in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made praiseworthy efforts dispeled by the obstruction of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare site, nor the attacks of drones
The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Faculty of Medicine.
I'm reading a terriblely sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is the memory of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients in the evening and sleeping, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could blow you off.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the news newspaper presenters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades were crying for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries moved towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period of Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82 per cent of favourable opinions.
And then I'll close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, these are like far-reaching memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really occurred in the years that followed the first time I voted.
This had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Avfordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "not seen nor known" and the murder of Usama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstruction has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the administration of Obama against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm at the edge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain how foreign leaders are being listened to, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on American privacy, nor the accusation of offenders that reveal the government's misconduct.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the excess of authorized expenditure during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are "the most aggressive ... since the administration of Nixon".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Act on Affordable Care has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If I was 18 years old, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the political opposition party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what I'm most disturbed about.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his application.
Mitt Romney was presenting a confused and unsustained alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term and freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had heard for so long.
However, while the positive opinion index fell below the 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to go back on the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We were five years ago, Mr. President, and I do not agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The 26-year-old motorcycle Jonathan from Fléron was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid response of relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MEP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
MEP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mining magnat, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, argued this argument to try to remove any conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the election committee officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast headquarters of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a recast of the voting system to speed up the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the ballots.
Is that to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Election Commission has examined options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, said that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously”.
Public service is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society identified a new species of dolphin in the north coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Environmentx Marins (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new type of dolphin at work surprise you?
It's a good news, but I'm not surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomic and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
Moreover, it is not possible that such progress in genetics and molecular biology jeopardize the classification or belonging of a species to a genre, a family or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged due to the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very close morphological species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
A dozen years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific dolphins and Atlantic dolphins.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
Although this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a virus epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could deal with the eradication of a species rather than with the local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or being extinct based on the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. stocks, and the possibility of recovery from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, the population of the new species discovered, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
We must know that the marine environment is the least known environment.
One prefers to send robots to Mars, rather than to know what lives in the Marian's pit, just 11 kilometres from the sea surface.
More money is spent in life research on other planets than in marine research, and it's time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its exchange market division from two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on suspects of currency manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed their cooperation with regulators in the world's largest financial market investigations, where US$ 5.3 billion are changing hands every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation, which reflects the scandal of Libor interbank rate manipulations.
The bank, who refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed that this month it had received requests for information from the regulators.
"The ongoing investigation on this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file reported that RBS had transmitted instant mail and messages files to and from a former trader, the Financial Conduct Authority, to the British regulator.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European Bargeld Trading Officer at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Head of Cash Trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that she had initiated action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator Finma stated that he was investigating suspicions of change market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange rate rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, reported sources close to the file.
Banks have been collecting instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reproachable acts.
The news about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines in investment banks trading units over the past few years, but which has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimise the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the wide market of highly liquid exchanges, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the growing use by banks of their own internal platforms " explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at a low cost."
The news arrived the same day when Credit Suisse announced that he had returned a trader working in his fund office negotiated the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been controlled," said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation on Mayor Rob Ford was fucked up, supported a lawyer
After the police had confirmed having handed on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby supported never seen a "so messy" investigation.
Me Ruby said to believe in the Canadian press that the police had " ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's occasional friend and driver Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion regarding the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said that they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby described as "unexplainable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, supporting that the chief of police Bill Blair had informedly chosen not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant if it was deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as "evident and desperate intention" to be claimed to the media in a case that does not concern him.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable motives" that could lead to the filing of a criminal accusation against the mayor.
European Fellowships down in mid-season except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are declining on Friday to mid-season, lead by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could devote its quantitative flexibility policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, following the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could facilitate its monetary policy.
Wall Street's futures suggest an increase in US actions after two consecutive sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4,63%) recorded the strongest replica of the CAC 40, lead by the result warning of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing results in decline this morning and announced the internal creation of a bad bank structure, comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) continues to be the leader of EuroFirst300's rises in response to press information that AT&T wants to study a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation on the ECB's monetary policy evolution is going well, as John Hardy shows, stratege at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting next week.
We are expecting a strong potential for declining the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its response to the US currency and hit in session a less than two weeks to $1.3517.
On the other hand, these same assumptions support the bond market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for Obama's administration: The US Supreme Court today declared that the law on reform of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Health Protection and affordable Care Act), which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014, under the guarantor of a fine, and stated that it was constitutional under the government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, met with the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2700-page Act and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered to lose all federal funding from the program, was compulsive in accordance with the Constitution.
The law blocking procedure was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major republikan candidates for the 2012 presidential election in the 2012 primarys, including the appointed candidate Mitt Romney, have strongly opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to former combatants in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid a tribute to the soldiers and deceased from all wars on Friday afternoon.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Enhancement between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas combatants were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday, 31 October 2013, during a violent hanging on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip has ceased to operate on Friday, November 1, after its fuel stocks have been exhausted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a chariot shooting during an incursion of the Israeli army east of Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel engraved by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli chariot and a blinded bulldozer invaded a hundred metres inside the territory before leaving.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said that Israeli soldiers had found death in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulated the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defending the territory during a sionist invasion in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
" Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupyer," the spokesman threatened.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was from the outset a section of a large, Israeli tunnel that had been buried in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to combat Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communication.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive gear for the forces of Tsahal (Israel Army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said Peter Lerner's spokesperson.
Furthermore, Israel hit an air military base in northwest Syria, aimed at cargoing missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Movement Hezbollah, reported the Al-Arabiya satellite channel on Thursday 31 October.
An American officer confirmed an Israeli strike but did not give any details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he just added.
Heads of the Israeli Government refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it has not appointed, the Saudi capital chain stated that "bombing has aimed at a load of ground-air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday morning in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents in Danse her two new group choreography: the first inspired by Henry Michaux' ink and poems, the second insufflé by the famous solo piano Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows to see all the prism of Choïnard, from art to tics and black to white ink.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, progresses, profile, ends like a line and dressed with black, a body.
On the screen, a Henry Michaux ink is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a cloth of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed with black, only the hands and the face discovered, wait on each side of the play area, hurry when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, come out in the current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relays of solos, in group at unison (a masses that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each executes its sign.
It is thought of "Gloire du matin", where, in solo, Choïnard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online on the front scene.
It's the same principle, the giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
It will be assured when Carol Prieur will flee under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro-in-hand, without sobriety or retained, a part of Michaux' poem, monocord and monotone in the scream, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if possible, ends up ashoring and bending.
As does also the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hair that drowns or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has insisted, with his tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux' inks, such as Gestalt's shapes, open up a broader and blazing imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hacked by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The public loved, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the attraction, are more rich.
The scene is partly covered with grey sheets, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a missed house.
In the piano, dancers were reluctant to play the scores.
Their inadvertent music, touching, gives real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, sets that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, bowing the red nose, in very polarized men-female parades.
Loves are carnivores, escapers or players.
The gestural, laughter and small screams transform the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies into coïts, the beings that merge.
But the piece takes its real flight after the salvation.
A clown comes back to stage when the public leaves.
Here everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes superpose, the dancers chabotinate, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play applause codes, stretch the sauce into a roughly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and folly are sweating, and it's Chouinar's art, here, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to judicial proceedings concerning Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents started a trial of patent prosecutions on Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he haircuts at the pot when selling patents to auctions that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 million, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for infringement of patents before the United States Court of First Instance in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertisement related to terms of search on the Internet, have indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is the core of Google's business.
It was not possible to contact the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally propose $4.4 million.
After losing the Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 Md, a part-based market based on the Motorola patent library.
"Although Google failed in trying to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it violated and continued to violate the patents," stated the trial's findings.
Rockstar claims greater damage and interest against Google, as he claims that the violation of Google's patents is obsolete, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater caused by the explosion
The grandmother would have turned on a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a dwelling in Gesves, which made two serious injuries on Friday morning, a grandmother 52 and her granddaughter 5 years old, was due to a leak of gas from a defective water heater, said Friday evening the replacement of the King's Prosecutor.
The expert sent on site by the prosecutor ensures that the source of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother turned on a cigarette while there was a leak and a accumulation of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The young boy, who stayed with his grandfather and companion, was next to him and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU in Luik, she helicopter, he was in an ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, descending on the site.
Damaged, grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and except, he could reach the ground floor through the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, fragilized by the explosion, were rehabilitated by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Ark Police have intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt requests the first freely elected president to give oath
Mohamed Morsi has sworn an investment oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he swore the investment to the Presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Moubarak who was chased out of power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the reversal of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore in front of the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for better days, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, who was formed by the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal organization and severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acknowledging the new president, and, marking the fast presidential Moubarak years, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the very frequent streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the "relief wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and Friday speech, during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 revolt against authoritarian President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue costume and red cravate, addressing the judges present in the woodworks room where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national hymn while he was taking care of you.
Marechal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." astonished by thousands of people gathered in the university's great amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and former lay education bastion, the University of Cairo later became a fief of groups of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday on the Tahrir Square, from which the revolt that ended Moubarak's authoritarian regime last year, and swore to retrieve the presidential powers of which the military council, who replaced the former evacuated president, deposed him.
But by accepting the formal oath before the Court, rather than before the Parliament as it is used, it turns to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on the Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The US shutdown has hampered the rise in the car market
The closure for 16 days in most federal governments weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by manufacturers on Friday, five of the six leading cars having achieved performance below expectations.
The three major manufacturers of Detroit show two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the bank's clients, he believes that this slight brake is primarily explained by "the government 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first fifteen of the month".
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group improved their commercial performance compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of his pick-up, saw his sales rise from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus was expected to be 194,301.
At the same time, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced a 11% increase in its sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus, despite one-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM action won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT, while Ford handed over 1.1%.
Renault Bleeded in Stock Exchange by Nissan's Warning
Renault accuses the highest decrease in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after his partner Nissan Motor announced to have decreased its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to make such a revision, also announced a change in his direction.
Several traders reported that Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a responsible for trading a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to the data of the Nissan website.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a local of the Neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was severely wounded on Friday night by shots by two people who were on board a motorcycle that passed in front of a local of the Neonazi Aube golden party in the western suburb of Athens, was learned from police sources.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that golden Aube members had argued that the victims were guards of their locals.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police from the Anti-Terrorist Service hurried on the central Avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurs a few weeks after the indictment of six members of Golden Aube, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of the Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two club champions' League matches against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against the Barça for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish middle saw its suspension extended to three UEFA meetings.
In a press release, his club said "very disappointed," saying that his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Friday afternoon, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers dived into the black, the Montérégie with 13 464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also has its lot of breakthroughs with nearly 7,000 private households in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to turn the trend.
The company has reviewed its net profit forecasts upwards and hopes for record results thanks to Australia and the United Kingdom vacationers.
The travel agency now expects to achieve a underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are reached, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of benefits in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had begun in force, particularly with regard to travels other than business trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are in a good position to achieve record results for the entire fiscal year before deduction of interest and taxes," he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the recreational travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, compensating a low domestic market for business travel.
Likewise, in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
His subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half of the year, where seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the entire year for the third consecutive period.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people shoot at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown people opened fire this Friday at a hotel close to Cairo's pyramids in Egypt without making victims, as a result of a apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, stated the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, General of Police Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt has almost not received any tourists since the army has dismissed the Islamic President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diversified reading.
A combination of English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and mathematics programs tomorrow – the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes in other basic matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Board of Auditors of Examinations, will reveal a change in the structure of the CSSEs, with a new rating system and less courses.
During the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," stressing that the SGCs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more stringent".
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time-use to mathematics, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deep mathematics – as well as the greater importance given to the subjects in international classifications – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of course.
The programme will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that State, which largely jeopardizes the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
A octogenary welcomes children with a gun at Muy for Halloween
The 9- and 13-year-olds made a door-to-door call for candy on Halloween night.
One of the riverains of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting gun.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the director of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common cemetery of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured on a large scale daily using archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great énigmes of the Post-Guerre.
German secret services, the BND, as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were completely wrong.
"Since August 1945, the body of Müller was found in a provisional tomb near the former Department of Aviation of the Reich by a commando," said Tuchel.
He was wearing a general uniform.
"In the left-hand pocket, his service conditions were with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district mayor of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly crowded," he resurrected in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final resolution" and, in particular, had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to see hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Heroes of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a haematom that he was going to carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years with his father in busy clinics and hospitals to get any treatment that he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," says Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the United States ratio is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty threshold, and nearly three quarters of the country's health spending are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and his fellow countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed over 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he established a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, who travels to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they go into vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrains to go to the villages most in need of help.
Lucky doesn't always follow them.
They have often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, singing and dancing and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and overwhelming energy – is more than happy to join the festivals.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people at each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive bowls, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate – document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practiced simple surgical acts under local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, a mayor or a home; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the wake-up room to leave his or her place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a breathtaking pace, but village musicians generally help the team to remain motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working," Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make the difference for those they come to help.
A man explained that the free operation he had undergone to cure a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to making this traveling hospital live and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at private hospitals around Yaoundé at night.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances its association at 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in the hospital or is trying to find money for his association to be able to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nurses such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn in the field that they don't have at home.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help dig the blood or transfer the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a doctor in second year.
Volunteer students generally pay their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transport and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happy by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, academics have long tried to define and find Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and the classrooms?
Probably, but underlining its weak for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitring the works of others in his office at the Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Yes, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Surely yet, but knowing that such a priest cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has happened.
They would gladly recognize in him a great awakener, animator and federalist of their work, but by pointing out that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image, the monument of the "Memorial Sites", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages have seen a gigantic chip market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a vigorous eye-catcher and lesity of learning, but incurably dilettant.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book here should make him permanently justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of the ubiquitity, the intellectual vagabonding, the jubilation to jump as joints from one subject to the other.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brocanter back to one single passion: discovering the constituting node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: this is a concern of the time.
Here, we were collectively invited to provide a definition.
But in the perpetual spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only through the deployment of accidents, and the case, jacobinism compelled, was entrusted to the prefets and subprefets, authorized interpreters.
The one Peter Nora's tracking is quite another.
He does not inherit everlasting freedom, he refuses to define himself.
An alarming analyst of a familiar strangeness, he diverges in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of rebus, tortured with irritating questions.
Of which, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so long-standingly established in its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masonsed, are these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure the trouble born from the discords of French history.
Francs and Gaulies, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that sheds in two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but not to deny it; on the contrary, concerned about the return of sacrificiality and the more greedful of unity and indivisibility as it had cut its head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation of it.
And from there, a invincibly binary nation, shared between left and right, layness and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, a declaration of rights, and wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousinship only makes better emphasis on what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men inhabited by an ancient native regime, and even more radical.
There is a consensus revolution when here she sowed the drama and confided it.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are hard to make models, and who have been killed between themselves.
Here is an institutional continuity, and here a cascade of constitutions, as so many mistakes to catch and trials to resume.
France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France,
However, there was a time when the French thought they could retrieve the broken dress from their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this central and creative moment of the Third Republic, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the pupils everything that in ancient France was darkly preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But that peaceful identity had only one time.
It is here again in the debate, overwhelmed by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the surroundings of France that comes.
With, in the first place, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
It's discovered that the path was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The scaffolder stood in the center of the centre.
And whoever had deposited, here, more than a half-century, a subject about the idea of nation, but had abstained from the initial exercise of the thesis, trusts us, cum grano salis, that he will end up doing it.
Certainly in a less rigid, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But do not mislead us, as binding.
For much more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is complex enough to manage"
Born in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" coming to film a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the establishment of the World Hostage Defence Association, which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
The four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families since then.
And try, gradually, to resume their course of life.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, ex-large reporter, retired since 2008, president of the Association "Gathers of the World".
From the night of your release, you were on the plateau of "Antenne 2" at 20:00.
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, for example, in Beirut.
When I was released, I found myself in the safe of a car where I met - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're freed," but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense, too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a trottoir.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the Summerland hotel site where the press is present.
French bring us to the French Embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And eating a t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on the French floor?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty of.
The descendment of the aircraft's staircase, the reunions with my son and parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorbikes pull the drunk to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from climbing.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it clearly.
We're out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
In the evening myself, I'm at 8:00 p.m. and the next day I'm on TV.
Then start a kind of life rehabilitation, very slowly, for one or two months, which are a little like holidays.
How were the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I had the right to a first medical examination in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the following days my return: radios, examinations in all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me some questions about the hostages.
That was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's going on.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things are mad at me, others less.
I'm trying to make the difference between the questions about my past as hostage and my chairman's chapel of the "Olds of the World" association, which allows me to put a distance, and seems much more interesting to address.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
In particular, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
Prison of hostages must be classified as "political" hostages - as is most of the case - and allow hostages to have access to justice, complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in the Hague is made for this.
Why don't we say to hostages "you've screwed up the rules of war, like those of all Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice?"
It seems to me, however, to be justified, legitimate, hit by good sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger falls in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of President-in-law Mohamed Morsi, they came down in the streets.
Mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
This is not a trial that emphasizes this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a fake.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial, a pro-Morsi, and it's he who's supposed to have Sisi judged, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, the police used lacrymogen gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed at the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and benefits that come with it," the Minister recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to spouses of the same sex in the National Guard facilities," established in their territory, he declared, repudiating those States for violating the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said that he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The frown of the nine States began with Texas who refused to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas Law and the Federal Law on Gay Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Caroline and Western Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5,600 active persons, including the National Guard, the Reserve and the retired.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are made on place Saturday morning from 9:00 p.m. and the qualification phases will begin in the search at 10:00 p.m. before the scheduled final at 3:00 p.m. and the awards will be delivered at 4:00 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical precedents of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young hyerois Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he doesn't like anything until he gets back to competitors who are over three heads.
The mayor of Toronto hunts journalists who came to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media.
A video handed over to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The respondent, Rob Ford, has always denied to have consumed crack, while recognising having a clue for cannabis.
On Thursday he chased from his property several journalists who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of anger detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of anger had been detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise, apparently foreign, while France has been free from indigenous cases since 2001.
The cat was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28th.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"A epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this cat between October 8 and October 28," said the Departments of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the cat have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"Look at the man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the animal bearer, but before the symptoms occur, is very effective," explains the communiqué.
Departments are now calling persons who have been bite, scratched, scratched, or leaked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with that cat between October 8 and 28, to contact the 08.11.00.06.95 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. from November 1.
"Because France has been free of rage since 2001, this cat or mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of "early" rabies identified on a frog dates back to December 1998 and that "France is officially declared free from this disease in November 2001 by the International Office for Epizooties (OIE)".
A case of rage on a illegally imported dog from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Anger is a mortal disease if it is not treated in time," reminds the departments, and it is transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease occur.
Obama moves back on its health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President over the last few days, accusing him of deceiting the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that are suitable for them can keep it," he said at a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an indignation in the news" about the termination, President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to get full and better suited health plans for the same price, or even for even less expensive than expected.
"You'll get out of it," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the self-accounting population were forced to change the regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who supervises the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online market in October had failed “deceasedly”.
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to restoring your trust.
It is an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who pronounced this sentence, while she believed her micro-sliced, talking to an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following a disputed exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on asking Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to sign a regime through HealthCare.gov, which she now swears to millions of Americans.
Vettel stretches a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-fold world champion of Formula 1, removed a special helmet with a 21-year-old Mexican fan for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday.
Vettel chose among 1,500 drawings from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from his store.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to carry this helmet on Friday and Saturday.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his part of the suburb
Don't be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti of the suburb" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies.
When I talk about suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent his project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his native municipality of Aubervilliers, was born of the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great melting cultural pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorial attaché, claims today to be "100% apolitical" even though it has not always been neutral.
In 2002 with Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values I advocate in my program are linked to the left but if the right people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program - consultable on the Internet- from many themes supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the building guard function...
Remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political stage."For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair, he recognizes."
It's a problem of time and money.
The suburban party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my application and I hope in other cities too.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support mails I have received since yesterday don't all emanate from a suburb" he is pleased.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedented, that American spying "was gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry reported a softening of the United States' defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedented, that on several occasions spying "was gone too far inappropriately".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of fire revelations by the detector Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities occurred.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the heart of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Mr. Kerry, speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London through a video link, said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have known certain things in automatic pilot fashion because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course then on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American spying had exceeded the limits, but stressed that the rights of each person had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases it went too far inappropriately."
And the President is committed to trying to clarify and clarify to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry stressed that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to be blown."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, explode them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented aircraft from falling, exploding buildings and people from being murdered because we have been able to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged American spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States," explained Thursday the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he had spoken to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration caused by the National Security Agency's supervision.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first mandate, and Chairman of the US Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, during an interview since Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has hampered the relationship with some US allies, but this week the Agency's director stated that this was incorrect and a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of allies by indicating that it was necessary and a common practice on both sides.
In this tumult atmosphere, Murphy stated that his office was organising a visit from Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route was still to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to enable relations to be improved, but also to demonstrate " affectionate firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the kind of spy programmes they have been applying for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans' rights, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do spying," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the chaos caused by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange ended down on Thursday, led by Shell's bad results and after an announcement by the Fed of maintaining the state of its economic support, as planned.
An Australian appeals for her imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in Phuket for allegedly wrongly being assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed for judgment and was released under bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Tribunal on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled it, had attacked him early on Sunday, 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her little Australian friend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to have invented the story of all pieces.
She was detained in a local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in the periphery of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help his daughter.
Tunks said at Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of her daughter and wanted her to come back to Australia.
"We have of course had an annoying time, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after the payment of a warranty of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but they warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years of imprisonment and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket by Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image to tourists, which could lead to a compensation.
The French police will stop the supporters of Anderlecht coming differently than with the cars of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, announced Marie Verbeke, the spokesman of the police area Brussels-November, Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who wish to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system established by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post from Rekem to the PSG stage," the spokesman sent.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to visit Paris by other means, the French police prefecture announced that measures have been taken to allow arrests or even guards in sight," Marie Verbeke announced.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This was why a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff was initiated to reflect on ways to better integrate students living on horses between different cultures.
The school commission has just revealed its vision of living together in French.
The Vision Diversity organization has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all origins discover common tracks that are not limited to French.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture, our places are signs.
Large names of writers, artists, whether they're of a tribe or have come from other places.
Who are our builders?
"We create projects so that they can identify themselves with all this," explains the president of Vision Diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne from the Institute of New World has identified several challenges for the school commission.
"For example, the transmission of Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations that are being experienced in student clients," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee has created a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies are the real need," she summarises.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: language, school, social and cultural.
