Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosed as a mental illness, and now he's doing art about the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports on the project room roof of the Academy of Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multiannual story about how external people have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Deciding who he is for him.
"I wanted to tell the person about my moderate history of treatment so that the violence in the process could be visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender recovery process.
It is often a year-long period of study involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process is initiated by sending the diagnosis of "sex-identity disorder" studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Before this, he had used the estrogen that he ordered through the Internet and was, by the way, very long in his own repair process.
She experienced her being a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through the repair process so that sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on the strengthening of the transsexual sex (563/2002), obliges transsexuals to have forced sterilisation in order to obtain the right sex, for example, in the population register centre and passport.
At present, each gender remedyor is required for psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of inability to reproduce.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
Translain reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law, and the European Human Rights Court has a preliminary decision which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right of self-determination.
The previous Government of Finland prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovise.
The elections were fired and the Finnishs rose to the government.
Now, the change of law is back in jail.
It is a question of internal policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to raise it, because there are disagreements within the government about amending the law," says Frank Johansson, Director of the Department of Amnesty in Finland.
The front part of the exhibition space is controlled by two large installations.
One of these consists of the packs and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist transpole of the University Hospital in Tampere from Auer.
On the basis of these, a psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report to define the treatment and assistance of Auer’s law.
The consciousness of the reality to be investigated appears to be subject to a disruption.
The concept of itself to be investigated appears to be fragmented at a cross-border level and the instability of personality is highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex rehabilitation treatment.
According to the treatment staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was banned from his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpole into a TV waiting room.
Later on that TV, an artwork called Monument for the Excluded was created, where Auer reflects his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is born as a woman can increase his breast, but to remove the breasts needs a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than the amount of your sex defined in the birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not his only quality.
The gender rehabilitation process is more difficult for many for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
It will meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who need support and help are refused treatment, suggesting that their resources are not sufficient," Auer says.
Many of the applicants for the process have a mental symptom: depression, anxiety, possible temptation experiences.
As suggested, care staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"To prevent carelessness and access to help can cause a person to get even worse than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer's own exhibition also addresses tribulation and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life, and that is what people are usually difficult to melt."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, the feeling was eased.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had existed in childhood and teenage.
The reason why the wide chin did not seem to be suitable for your own body and why the chest muscles should be round instead of the flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people close to him who see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using a voice and moving," he says.
Nowadays, Auer is already experiencing his being seen, he exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, random comments from close ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts most when close people get missexed.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they don't agree or be able to inside it," he continues.
However, not all trans-humans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. from body contradictions, where the body or parts of it may cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, formal confirmation for their own sex cannot be obtained.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-year-old applicant makes a written application for a new personal identification, stating that he is another sex.
After a six-year period of consideration, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identification.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland and this requirement is also covered by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it will make political changes during the time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning to Missour
The National NAACP Organisation of African American Citizens' Rights has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which is due to the State's discriminatory practices and racist attacks.
"NAACP travel information on Missouri comes into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to take extreme caution when travelling in a state where a number of subject race-based events have occurred recently," states the organization's newsletter.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to justice, and the implementation of the State laws is subject to disproportionate minorities, which, according to NAACP, led to the provision of a travel warning.
"Human rights are violated.
They are stopped on the basis of skin color and abuse or killing," said the NaACP president of Missouri Rod Chapel to Kansas City Star.
"We haven't heard of as many cases in a short period of time before."
The travel information on Missouri is the first warning for the U.S. State.
The organization mentioned the racist comments against African American students at Missouri University and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in question earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car was out of fuel, and Missouri police arrested him, even though he was not accused of a crime.
The travel information also referred to the statement by the Minister of Justice of Missouri that the police would stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the white.
"The purpose of the travel newsletter is to urge people to be careful and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"Humans must prepare themselves, for example, by taking money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they are planning to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, hundreds of hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth most in the U.S. states.
Travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge housing and discrimination in employment relations.
The ACLU, the civil rights defender of the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that forced the police to arrest people from immigration abuses, which, according to the scheme, increased racial profiling.
Generally travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them as a response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the Executive Director's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (central) Minister of Economic Affairs, responsible for State ownership, has requested from Finnair a report on the additional pension fee received by the CEO of the airline Pekka Vauramo, Yle reports.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the state's statement of will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vauramo was raised this week when the Helsinki Sanomat news about the performance of the management of stock exchange companies.
Finland's Image magazine has news about Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said he would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has stated that additional pensions are not used for rewarding.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the last year's decision of principle on ownership management.
The sanctions immediately tightened the speech
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
In connection with the G20 meeting of the industrialised countries in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be a great deal of work.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted last week by the United States Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday, were responded bitterly in Russia.
The most disgusting response has been heard by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who says that the sanctions signed by Trump mean "complete trade war".
Although Russian reactions would only be counterfeit in the form of scourges and overshoots of political rhetoric, the extortion between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month after Trump's election.
In the United States, the implementation of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress accepted the law with considerable unanimity, it was much more difficult for the President to adopt the law.
Trump therefore criticised the law that he recently signed as "significantly deficient".
President Trump must have been the cause of his anxiety, especially in Russia, even though the adoption of a law that restricts his rights of power must also have been disastrous.
As well as it is well known, the United States is investigating the possible involvement of Russia in presidential elections as well as the Russian links of the Trump campaign.
The extortion between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of splendour.
When the staff of the White House have changed to a lot and various skandal turns have almost updated, it seems more and more clearly that foreign policy is not being done in the United States under the leadership of the President but despite the President.
Such a situation is in no way desirable.
If Russia's relationship is strong in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tension in the security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea also strengthens relations.
The EU has clearly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained unified in its Russia policy, at least on the top, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that is doing a lot of trade with Russia, such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real challenge.
The effects of the United States' recent sanctions law are still unclear.
The EU is afraid that sanctions will hamper the activity of many European companies.
In Finland, for example, the effects can be felt in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
In Europe, acidity has been caused by the exclusion of the sanctions, for example, from the United States' important liquid natural gas industry.
Trade bans are a means of world politics, a means of demonstrating aggravation.
However, economic sanctions must be very thoughtful and specific.
Otherwise, it is easier to harm them than to benefit.
Isn't nothing holy anymore?
Trump's White House now has a Statue of Freedom
Intrusion in the statues is the most likely sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqi people, together with American soldiers, dropped the statue of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists of Trump's administration, knew well what was going to be done in a rude debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta, where the status of freedom was attacked by Miller in a vocabulary on the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have attacked huge flocks of cruise organizers and imitating characters from the Statue of Freedom.
His attack was the significance of the statue and especially the fact that in 1903 the poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the statue – 17 years after the completion of the statue.
That's how Miller put Acosta: "I don't want to go into history now, but the Statue of Freedom is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later, and it is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller himself wasn't wrong, but it's not just history, as he said.
Essential are the touching words of Lazarus, their only quality in which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refusal of your theeming shore."
The poem is now more timely than ever.
Miller did not exercise literature criticism at all, and he made it clear that "the poorest" are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The importance of the Stat of Freedom is part of the broader political and cultural controversy of the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’ friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to his statue, and they knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between the French and the American Republic by a classic symbol, by female incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: his poem is no longer an abstract woman, but it has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Attaching a poem to the imagination was a genius feminist rapture of power and a devastating attack on the American state of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted it to be restored to the original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, a novelist who can now be regarded as a prophecy of Trump, claimed that the Statue of Freedom is not calling anyone, but is the early pioneer of the new Conservatives, who takes the United States' blindness into the world covered by the darkness: "Lady Liberty is coming up.
He's taking the freedom to go from the United States to the rest of the world.
"The rock doesn't show the way to the United States."
Rarely yes, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship’s edge after a long and challenging journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for a better life.
His statue of freedom comforts by giving hope and by welcoming him.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their faintness does not show the way, but turns the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Sports Championships 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the British Country Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scotts got to the British country team.
The UK General Sports Association’s leader, Neil Black, says that 16 Scottish members of the world championship team are a "significant confirmation".
A number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in London on Friday.
According to Black, "there's something special going on in Scotland" which British general sports must learn.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it so long as we understand what it is about," Black says.
"I met with the representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports, and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish public sports union, however, believes that it is linked to the activities of the Union,
And the United Kingdom General Sports Association believes that it has their activities in its background.
And the ordinary streetr thinks he must have something to do with it.
However, this is something quite amazing, which is why it is then the result."
Many Scottish athletes in London are seriously competing for the medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5000-metre run. Eilidh Doyle was selected as a captain of the country team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"The athletes left the opportunity with pride from their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they lived and practiced.
Eilidh's words had real emotion and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver champion of the international championship competitions at 400 meters, and these are his fifth world championship competition. He thinks it's "unglaubful" that the country team has 16 Scottish.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, the midnight runner, has been running five British and two European recordes in the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs at 1 500 meters in London. He also needs to be watched: he has an excellent season behind him, including the wins in the British World Championships and the Anniversary Games competitions.
Doyle remembers her first world championship competition, when the only Scotch of the country team in addition to him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says he's "powerful proud" of the fact that there are so many Scotlands involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
"Captainship is a great honour anyway, but even more special is because the members of the team voted the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scotlands that got into the country team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are part of the prized athletes who compete for prize winners.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it was fine.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the public at home and that we are again at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be crazy."
Preventing reviewers on Facebook: Do not apply for a public service if you can't handle criticism
Our country's father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic policies always in terms of his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as stupid and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. Union of Civil Rights challenged Hogan in court earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge to be unfounded, and their attitude was also detrimental online.
"What's the matter? This is just Facebook," many comments.
But it's important.
In particular, in Hogan's case.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of the democratic state.
He has received the second best estimates among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive reaction to the hot one.
He has led the state firmly and kept firmly on the principles.
He has also been able to use Facebook as the main contact channel for his voters and has published a picture of his head in chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and even dangerous to prevent users coming to the Governor's Facebook site. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax funds.
Hogan's reporter Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's role in an interview with Washington Post.
However, stamping commanders as trolleys, spiders or haters is too easy to resolve.
Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk with the leaders they chose, not trolleys, but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, kind and material.
The pastor quoted his comment on the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not hostile, but raised a question about hate crimes.
"I kindly commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hatred crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the Washington Post news comments.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same matter, they are immediately regarded as an organised group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "centred attack" and someone else could call them to promote matters considered important.
During Facebook's time, communication is easy to control by preventing the critic or removing a critical comment.
Earlier, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It is, however, really the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump's Twitter users have brought him to court.
The first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to the Alexandrian District Judge James C. Cacherikse, the government of Loudoun County violated the first addition of the U.S. Constitution in preventing voters from voting on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association was discussing the use of Twitter and Facebook by Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At the time of Washington, low-cost postal charges had the same effect as today on the Internet.
The number of newspapers was quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers blew Washington.
There were trolleys at that time.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they slandered Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the agreement of Jay, the cooperation, trade and maritime agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, which is reflected in documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the foundations of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about ten places, and in addition to online notifications from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from South and Real Finland, but then the individual from Hapavate and Seinäjoki, special researcher Marja Isomursu Evira tells.
Green peppers have died of a parasitic disease called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a scientific animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has already been known that it will hit pigeons, especially in the cloth.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected from peppers.
In 2009, it was really good.
The tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland's green pepper pot, followed by the recovery of the species’ strains.
There have been sick green peppers now, but at least not in a large scale, Museummaster Juha Honkala of the University of Helsinki's Natural Science Center Museum (Creation).
It is frightened that the previous epidemic of green beans will be renewed unless something is done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on this later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field representation at the Renaissance Club
The former European first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field representation for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East London organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, the Northern Ireland Rafferty led the tournament on Archerfield Links in the neighbourhood before the last round, but finally lost Paul Eales. Rafferty is pleased with the new place and serves as the ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to full glory," says Rafferty.
"The players will see the field at their best, and it's in great condition.
Jerry's been doing a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great show for this field."
The English Eales will defend the championship for the first time, even though he has won his 32-year career for both the European tour and the European challenge tour.
"This really feels like a special opportunity," says the player living in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open win because the tournament is not part of this year's tour.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr is returning to real action on his own soil, and he went on tour after completing earlier this year for 50 years.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in the countryside is always more important," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty much.
I'm satisfied with my game so far."
The triangle will join the field of the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scotts: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All the proceeds are donated to the Prostate Cancer UK cancer organization.
In the swing, the potential internal air problems of casarm were solved.
At least no internal air problems have been found in the messenger construction of the Porin Brigade, which was reported on Thursday.
Internal air studies are continued.
The reports began when the man who interrupted his crew service for health reasons thought his health was weakened due to the bad interior air of the casarm.
According to Colonel Holman, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems with the health situation of other crews.
It turned out that this was an individual case and that there were no health problems with other servants in that unit.
Every notification is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment it is not known that we have any internal air problems, says Holma.
The press release of the Brigade states that, due to the arrival of July, the goods must have been transferred to the cafeterias, which may have promptly increased dust.
That could have led to an intrusion of the air, says Holma.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use fancy cooking.
He's only rarely using a caterpillar.
Degei lives in the wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia’s restless province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the batet – locally “nota” – directly on his fire.
In half an hour, the bat burned to the carriage will be eaten steeply with the pale, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei’s home. He sits on a muddy painting, where he usually also takes care of his daily ash, such as washing in the near intestine, in damp water.
The office of the visitor will be delivered by a bucket in an uncovered room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of his husband, and he has not been assigned to care for the fields.
Multilinguality is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one dare walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare stirring in the Ark of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which joined Indonesia in 1969. The controversial referendum before the accession, in which 1,026 village-inmates were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement of the Netherlands's power quickly turned its anger to the government of Jakarta, which keeps the region under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The Enarotal is a remote and a spoon. The trip there begins on an an hour and a half flight from the province's capital city from Jayapure to Nabire and continues on an abdominal five-hour drive with the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In the city of about 19,000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboos, whose waves of rust have coloured in yellow browns.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papua Mee Pago tribes worshipped the God of Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means a colorful, hand-woven boiler head, dark ham and bright coloured sweater.
"Before we only had leaves covered with our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia and 28 per cent of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and nullity are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the golden country of Indonesia.
Paniai is a top area of about 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, only about 100 miles from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion in gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, Papua has estimated $78 billion timber reserves.
To the Papal people, however, these riches bring anger, because they mean the repressive presence of the strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid almost $20 million to local military personnel and military units in 1998-2004. Up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
The demands of Papua for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income, and they are ignored without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 papuas and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings at the tops of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were subject to genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in peaceful demonstrations.
In the report of the Brisbane Archbishop We Will Lose Everything for 2016, there are reports of the brutalities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric attacks are particularly popular ways – and unpleasant attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"Reducing the number of threats is difficult because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher from the Human Rights Watch organization.
Screws have been extorted when Papua’s natural resources attract migrators from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 per cent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing when the people of Indonesia move from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes to the region in the hope of a better survival of Muslims.
The Javaian warung cookers sell baked chicken and gado-gado hatred mixture in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Movers have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who came from Pania and moved to the province's capital after work.
"The local women lost their clients."
In his 2014 election campaign, the Indonesian President, Joko Widodo – his favourite name Jokowi – promised to address Papua’s injustice and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 areas, and this former treekeeper won the vote in 27 areas, including Pania, on his way to the Presidential Castle of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to meet our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Pania had some kind of wave base just two months after Jokow's October homicides.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs near the fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark with motorcycles.
The scared children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the comment, and according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, he returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers captured the children and abused them with a rifle.
That's how one of the soldiers shot against the kids.
One of the children, 16 years old Yulianus Yeimo, turned to coma as a result of abuse.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Board near the venue was fired, and the next day began to happen.
Around a thousand Papuas — young men and women and children — gathered in the football field before the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They had hunting fences with them, and they began to perform a traditional waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, where they dance in the ring and track the bird song.
Some of the detectives started rocking the buildings of the police and the army.
When the atmosphere was warm, the soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system: "If the people's forces are making a resistance more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on the official document seen by TIME, which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the population of Kego Koto, thought the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine of his brightly painted wooden house on the veranda.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' lines.
"Several shots were fired in the unit."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," said Yohanes TIME magazine sadly. Like many Indonesians, he used only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
Papua police officer Yotje Mende told the journalists that the police only "protect" the police station because it was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, police officer of Papua in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The next day, the information on the killing was reported to Jakarta.
Three weeks later Jokowi gave a sentimental speech in Jayapura, expressing his sympathy to the families of the victims and promising that the violence of Papua would be tackled.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that no more such thing will happen."
In October 2016, Mr Wiranto said that he would launch reports of human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw his speech immediately.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early the 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but that requires certain processes," he said.
In the interview of the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start studies with Papua.
"Everything will be investigated in court," he told me.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "criminalities against humanity". Crimes relate to the death of over a thousand people in the blood of East Timor in 1999. Wiranto said to the TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Pania.
The families of Pania’s victims are disbelievers.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he's still alive in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panaians are not dare to discuss the event.
He tells me that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the burying of the victims," he says.
The shootings aren't over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the nearby Pania area in Deiya.
One died and 17 injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the building company, which began when the director refused to take the man who lost his mind to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital care was Ravianus Douw, 24 years old, who had been caught by water when he was fishing on a nearby river. He died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their minds on the building site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police unit opened fire against the crowd, and one villager died.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding home for two days."
Deiyai's Parliament has called for gunshots of police officers to be responsible and to withdraw the moving police unit from the area.
Pania has always been a problem of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live on the peppers of Papua.
Many have joined the liberation movement of Papua (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by random attacks and the abduction of Indonesian military.
Some of the OPM's leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of the arrested will never return.
Among the Papuas, Paniai is known as "a secret, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
There's only a little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it's too expensive for locals.
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly bats and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and one woman may be responsible for four or five batate fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest are sold on the marketplace.
Ten bats cost only 10,000 rubies (75 cents).
With the time, the differences in local and migratory livelihoods have increased and the number of migrators has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go locally to better educated and richer migrants.
Only a few beans have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Pania tribe council.
In the world, the Purple Papua will be given little attention.
Moreover, restrictions on international information are still strict.
Previously this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papuala, although they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to the Asian Deputy Director Phelim Kine of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not held his election promises; he has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by eliminating the restrictions on information.
"Indonesia's most restless eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua have new risks: refusal of visa and entry on the black list," Kine said in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "number of and widespread violations of Papua", including the attack of Pania.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Liberation Movement of Papua.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, mediator, challenged the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with press freedom, so it would be difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations".
Locals want the governments of the foreign authorities to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation under the leadership of the human rights Ambassador Kees Van Barar visited Jayapur on 4.5.2017, locals violated silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reports a permanent source of anonymity.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuas say that they will probably no longer vote Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Paniai shooting scene," says Gobai, President of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panaians: they live under the authority of a greedy and unpredictable army in a lack of poverty, practically without health services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panaians, like the other Papuas, consider the voices they gave to Jokowille as a "debt" which must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
In spite of threats and intimidation, the victims of the Pania shooting attack once again demonstrated a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the opposite country of the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says head on prints.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora shouts Robert Helenius's re-competition: "Even your own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran of a heavy series of boxers were supposed to fight on 27 May at Hartwall.
However, the fight was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In the recent interview of IFL TV, Chisora is putting the reason for the re-flopping of the game completely on Helenius's shoulders.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's bad, Chisora's annoying.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial sentence.
The ticket sales of the regaining game went instinctively, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told the evening-Sanoma in May that the match was transferred to the autumn.
There's nothing new about the fight since then.
However, the withdrawal will no longer harm Chisora.
Because the fight would probably have had to be cancelled in any case after Chisora's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My tyre was exploded.
They said I'd have to be surgery, Chisora says.
The British says he's in about 45% condition at the moment.
He's not interested in a regaining fight with Helenius, but Dillian Whyte.
In December, Chisora suffered the loss of a split voice.
Fire once again powered the Torch Cloud Designer in Dubai
The flames took over the world’s highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of inhabitants were forced to escape from the 79-storey building at 337 metres high.
This was already another fire within two years in a building whose name happens to be Torch, faint.
The building was emptyed, and no one is aware of the wounded, and the reason for the fire was not the idea immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," George-named resident told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Authority, the fire forces were fired at 4:00 a.m. local time and remained to cool the building.
The government announced to arrange accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise questions on the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings across the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch Building carried out an investigation in which it was found that the most damage was caused by the robbery and insulation of the plates used.
In the UK, the police believe that the Grenfell Tower insulation and curtain plates in London could contribute to the rapid advancement of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.

In the United States, more than 20 per cent of air travellers take in prohibited items, reveals surveys
The survey to air travellers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had carried prohibited objects consciously or unawarely by the United States Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) inspection points. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other objects with steel that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they had only later found out that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives in the mistake.
The survey responded to over a thousand passengers, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to discourage the rules.
Of the deliberately violated TSA rules, 19.7 per cent were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X generation.
Most commonly, the rules were violated by taking food and liquids into the plane.
More than three per cent admitted that they had carried steel objects to an aeroplane consciously. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had consciously carried banned drugs to an aeroplane.
The survey was attended by travellers from across the United States. The company carried out the survey wanted to find out how many smuggling goods had accidentally passed the security inspection and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travellers are also most likely to pass smuggling goods by the security inspection — consciously or unawarely.
However, as the company in question states, TSA's guidelines are rather complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be transported to the aircraft and how much.
It is therefore not surprising that the majority of TSA seizures are liquids.
For some time, there was also the thought that no books should be taken into the plane.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, rounded his decision to delay decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had challenged Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to the Court of Justice, Pruitt, Pruitt revoked his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce emissions from smoke foams in Obama's administration period.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency that she is headed takes better account of the needs of environmental decision-makers in the state.
Pruitt did not mention any action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The state should begin to comply with the level of soil ozone requirements for 2015 from 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would move the implementation of the decisions over a year so that his agency could have more time to learn about the plan, because the agency "does not want to intervene in local decision-making or adversely to economic growth".
Pruitt was a public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the leader of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental rules.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions in the chemical industry and in the fossil fuel industry.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the last retreat to Pruitt's plan to alleviate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted a decision that the EPA Director exceeded his authority in trying to delay the implementation of the decision of Obama's administration concerning oil and gas companies, which required companies to monitor and reduce the leakage of methanium.
In its opinion on Wednesday night, Mr Pruitt argued that his full translation of the ozone provisions only strengthens the cooperation of the EPA with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then waited for the activist groups and others to challenge it in the process of reaching an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and we are seriously dealing with deadlines.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use its "power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "reasonable and based on the best available information".
In Congress, the Republicans are driving a broader change in the ozone rules.
The aim of the legislative proposal adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The State Attorney General of the New York State, Eric Schneiderman, led by the Association of State States, which was challenged this week, said that the group was planning to continue its pressure.
"The change in mind of the EPA as a result of our claims will be a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who in their communities are exposed to the direct effects of the smoke ring," said Schneiderman.
In addition to New York, the complaint included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
There is ozone on the surface when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
Smoking this may cause serious respiratory difficulties for sensitive groups of people, and is also a part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths annually.
People's health promoters and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make a guy with our breathing air use of healthy sense," says Lori Ann Burd from the Biodiversity Center.
"We still have to fight Trump's government, because its ideological objective is to act under the conditions of the polluters and other groups in their own interests."
From the supercar manufacturer coming from the street actor - " happens in Ferrar's style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrar's style, the CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the information conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News.
All cases of East Savo ashes of the same type of virus
The chestnut artery is the same type of virus as the previous cases in East Savo, informs THL.
On Thursday, the laboratory for the Virology of the Institute for Health and Welfare has ensured that East Savo's fifth ash carcasses is the same virus stock as previous infections.
The THL has ensured that the ash carcass arthritis confirmed on Friday, July 28, is the same virus type as the previous cases in East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections found in East Savo have been related to the first ashes found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with other types of ash cocoa virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth of the infectious may still occur between August and half, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over, says Soster’s primary health care doctor Mirkaleena Erkkilä.
No new ashes infection or doubts have occurred since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone ensures that their own vaccination protection is up-to-date, says Erkkilä.
More about: Three new ashes in the Pirkanland - "Additional ashes or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a permissible scream
The soup of Pontika was not even considered to be legalized.
Bearing in mind the reason that the process produces, in addition to the wine, methanol that is toxic.
Preparing a scream at home is legal next year, but it is not even considered to legalise the pontica soup.
The scream is made by visitor, the dough again by distilling.
In the context of the destillation regulation, the process is based on the production of methanol, which is toxic, in addition to the wine.
There has been no political will for setting up the pontica soup for every man's right, the government council Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared a reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of pontica was not considered to be legalized.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, said MEP Outi Mäkelä (cok.).
He is part of the group of government representatives in the negotiations that took the view of the reform of the alcohol law.
A permit for distillation at home cannot continue to be granted even on the application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Imports tell us that there is a simple rule for the home manufacture of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be made at home by visiting.
This means that now, besides beer, cider and wine, you can make a legal cry at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements of flavouring and flavouring materials and enables the production of a scream, Mekelä to clarify.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavouring materials produced in connection with their use are clearly detectable.
According to the new law, drinks can be prepared as much as they want, and alcohol can be given for gifts.
It's still not allowed to be sold.
It is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much greater change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
Alcohol production is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Law on Alcohol will be before the Parliament as soon as the September starts.
The plenary session was held on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like the parliament has already taken a position, Mäkelä will be happy.
Oscar Pistorius was expelled by armed guards in the hospital
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was expelled to a southern African hospital because of heart attack suspects.
Pistorius's already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison reporter confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital.
The reporter of the Pistorius family told me that the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the sixfold Paralympic Gold Medalist to six years in prison for murder of her girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Listed telephone discussions reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The literacy of telephone discussions between the US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia has been leaked to Washington Post.
In the telephone debate held on 27 January 2017, Trump urged the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public speech on the fact that he is not going to pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States told Nieto that he had knocked the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall at the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a literacy of Trump’s first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is "silly", "silly" and "silly". According to the Obama period, the agreement negotiated would make him look like a "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgian massacre: Activists relaunch racist lyning in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in Monroe's small town in Georgia's countryside and continues its journey towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the team, a medium-aged man dressed in a dragon dress, taking deep breath from his cigar and tiring through the windscreen.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n----u!" the man is whispering.
Get out of the car!
The cry breaks the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-deployment, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the crushing of the shock is true when the hanging eye is punched into the "Roger's" neck.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford bridge to reset events in 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murders.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps re-arrest arrangements.
"It's the shame of history, but above all it's a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
He is a fascinating call for action and reminds the inhabitants of Monroe that the iniquity has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty ones to be brought to justice. We want it finally to be done, and we want to recover from the sadness and make a reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make a reconciliation until we get justice."
The detektiv will cover the body of the dead victim in Georgia's massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to NBC's news records, more than 50 men in Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of the censorship.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives of the lynch have always been known to locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Blacks of the Georgian state received the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court took its decision in April and the elections were held in summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the elections, when a black leasing farmer Roger Malcom stole a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently affected Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there was rumor in the city that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to FBI information, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid the $600 warranty of Malcom on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On their way home with Malcom and Dorothy, their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
They stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"There has been evidence that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Well, Brooks's saying this is a little more heartfelt.
"It was a vote murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to communicate to the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has controlled the re-invasion of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and imprisoning, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States.
It's hard to look at, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says is supposed to be.
"We don't want to talk about lyning because we would have to face our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s performances began in June. On the first day about 30 actors — ten black and twenty white — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Greene.
He has been presenting the local Ku Klux Klan leader in re-invasion for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"It's gonna get dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this side of history is also presented so that it never again occurs."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he is upset that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I told you to leave my country, n---u!"
Rascona, hester, answers.
And then we're going to hit it.
And then all (at least all the black actors) shrink in laughter.
Greene's laughing the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene is whispering.
"I just don't think the whites used the word "n--u."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's a slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is uncomfortable, but the room's power of a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
The attack starts at the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are sneaking.
No one's laughing.
The redisposition ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, shooting — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings the Billie Holiday Strange Fruit song.
His voice is broken by every other word.
A few feet away, fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
Almost half of the audience are black and half white.
There is a couple who has come to watch the show from Ithacasta New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited Brooks in the graves of the victims in the pressurizing humidity of Georgia.
The murders have changed from the story to true, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song show, Greene calls the crowd to check the bodies.
Children can look at artificial blood and unmovable bodies and whisper each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutes like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
The performers of the lynics took off their hints and wiped tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, a man presented by the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a hard show.
"It's okay," the woman involved in the show comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The White Couple from Altanta is discussing the presentation vigorously with the Black Couple that she has just met.
Denise Duplins, too, is hard to find words when she describes the feelings raised by the presentation.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch bad things that say and do people who look the same as you – just because they look the same as you," he says.
"My presentation made it notice that lynches continue to happen," he added. "They are only called arrests."
On the other side of the room Brooks remembers the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He already tells me he started planning the next year's show.
"Resistence is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Then the message is that this can happen again if we do not learn about it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
The hung-up of plants in the shops is a spark: this is what the removal of "surplus parts" really saves.
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of the flower cabbage from the store before weighing?
And take away a big part of the hat from the ananas, don't you think it's gonna weigh?
The answers share their views strongly: one of them is an indication of the most extremely exported nucleus, while others, on the other hand, do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that are not used and which, however, go home to garbage.
The phenomenon is identified in stores.
For example, in the K-Citymarket of Helsinki Ruoholah, there are papillos, because many, for example, cut off the leaves of the flower cabbage.
From the box, the magazines are exported to the shop for biowaste.
According to the news published by economic messages, the grocery sniffing wonders the merchants.
But how much money does it really save to remove extra parts of vegetables before weighing?
How important is this really about sniffing?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take away the leaves or breweries from ananas, latva-artish, lettuce, parsacal and flowerfish.
Flower cabbage: EUR 2.10 at the price of the paid flower cabbage was EUR 1.80, when all the leaves were cut away from it.
Ananas: The price of the total ananas paying EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was turned off.
Latva artisan: EUR 2.60 price was EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Pigs: Two pigs cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Cocoa: The average cocoa cost EUR 1 and without a bearing of 80 cents.
End result: If the leaves and stocks go off, save a few ten cents for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
Therefore, these purchases would have saved a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out from Barcelona - a brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian Easter Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports the news office AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid the football league to FC Barcelona, which played in the Spanish League, an outlet price of EUR 222 million.
The EUR 222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league braked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment undertaking of Neymar’s representatives.
According to the rules of the League, a company purchased cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by reversing money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and to his representatives who provided the money through the league to Barcelona.
They think Neymar's coming to Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to the new public at the opening of the period of PSG against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines details
In addition, Barcelona informed that it would provide information on the fee for the European Football Union Uefalle, so that the Union could determine the possible discipline measures in the case.
Among other things, the Spanish League president, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG would violate the rules of Uefa's economic fair game.
Uefa may be punished by a company that will make more than EUR 30 million in losses over three years.
Uefa says that the transfer of Neymar does not automatically break its economic blocks.
Neymar's transfer to PSG affects the company's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be evaluated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with considerable amounts, Uefasta was informed.
PSG owns a state-owned qatarian company Qatar Sports Investment.
The company is chaired by the former tennis professional, the qatariian Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, got heavy fire-damaged lightning from the attack... the lightning was recorded in the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was taking regular work on the plane at the International Airport of Lounas-Florida with a couple of colleagues when suddenly a lightning from the rainy sky hit the plane.
The lightning power threw the plane on the land near the wing of Dun.
Dunn was hurryed to the hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and told me he got an electric attack and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if she's alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burning, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It's traumatic to everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning system was on at the time of the case and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revitalizes business dividends by cutting
On Friday, British Education Group Pearson announced that he would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to its business pressures.
According to CEO John Fallon, employment reductions will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company has already reduced 4 000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
In May, Pearson announced that it would reduce costs again by GBP 300 million as part of its third savings programme, aimed at revitalising business deteriorated as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its view of the current year unchanged. Its turnover increased by £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Attack on the accident in Kabul: NATO soldier died in suicide attack
The suicide bomber hit the military in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, and the authorities said that the attack killed NATO's soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians also died in the attack in the Kabul Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and 30 people died on Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday night's explosion occurred when the joint NATO-Afghanistan Army patrol was subjected to an attack on a "person carrying an infidel explosive equipment".
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, at least 1.662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, 20 per cent of whom in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, a region where most Shiia Muslims live.
The Taliban announced that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in the centre of Kabul in a bombing attack, which was the most destructive attack of the country's militant group after the United States forces attacked the Taliban power in 2001.
Violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump considers whether the United States sends more troops to the country to assist the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA is arranging its decision on the postponement of the implementation of the Smoking Negative Provisions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA rounded its decision to delay the implementation of decisions that were taken during Obama's administrative period to reduce emissions from smoke foams the day after 15 states had challenged the Agency's court.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "ozone definitions" in 2015 until late Wednesday. According to the Agency, the decision is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, the smoking rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution must be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged 15 states mainly under the rule of democracy, including the District of Columbia. According to them, the postponement of enforcement was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental provisions of Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, are part of the broader economic growth programme.
Trump's measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, the breathing of ozone-containing air "may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person of the father’s leadership had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to doubts, the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security inspection.
The police don't tell you why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas separator and take it to a full public place, for example, in a public transport system.
Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan of the Australian Federal State says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to the suspect terrorist plans, four men were captured in the police boards on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
Managing Director of Liquid: Renewable fuels worked well
Oil processor The result of liquid before taxes decreased, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievose, the company made good results in oil products, the volume of sales of renewable products increased to record level and the development of the commercial profits of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, the comparable business profit improved the tax relief of the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to the Lievos, the profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and the more favourable markets, even though tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is going well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in the newsletter.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66,7 kg, met each other on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel premises in Los Angeles until Mikey Garcia, the unvincible champion of the WBC light series, walked through the corridor to greet Lomatšenko, the higher champion of the WBO spring series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the showtime with the unanimity decision of the former four-class world champion Adrien Broner, after which Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the best five of the different weight classes boxers.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "How's it going, Master?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomatšenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel at 7 a.m. Saturday.
When the two posed for the photographers, the manager of Lomatšenko Egis Klimas pointed out that the fight between men would be "perfect in terms of sizes".
"I'm an ex-fowler," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved a series higher [63,5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not so big.
I'm a small size for 63,5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light series.
He's got to get up to the lightweight series [61.2 pounds] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans hope.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomatšenko agreed.
"Snobbing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the game should be organized on the pay channel. It is part of the strategy that he has developed for Lomatšenko to debyte in the light series later this year and fight against Garcia (37 to 0, 30 hits) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the light series at the Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay channel because the fans have requested it," Garcia said and later announced that they were ready to fight on the channel, which offers the best prize package.
"We're the most interesting names.
No one else raises as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get to the deal..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomatšenko as a "unbelievable fighter" and maybe she was going to take a look at the match on Saturday.
Lomatšenko interrupted Garcia's league and said that this three-class champion from Riverside looked "very slow." Sorry, Mike... but you needed that crash.
Garcia said she was focussing on showing the strike force first and then boxing.
Men said they felt that they wanted the fight between them to be more and more.
"This is the game we're expecting.
No other fight raises as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomatšenko said he was waiting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average salary €5 300, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Lastly, Helsinki News told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor spoke when selling investment products.
Investment advisors and various sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
They are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applied at the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define skills requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that employees in the investment service perform their own APV1 or APV2.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of degrees for APV investment a company named Oy, which is a group of experts from both the Financial Supervisory Board (FIVA), universities and industry operators.
The degrees are 12-15 degrees and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
Its website tells us that in general, both exams are "very large in terms of requirements".
There are 10-15 books and a number of other guides and works.
APV investment degrees CEO of Oy Markku Savikko tells us that the percentage of exams passing is roughly estimated at about 70.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed either APV1 or APV2 degrees, as they are compulsory under the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bank movements without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have avoided the completion of the degrees, Savikko says.
According to him, such banking movements are "others".
According to Saviko, since 2000, the APV1 degree has completed 13 000-14 000 people and more demanding APV2 degrees for investment consultants, about 3 000 people.
Some bankers consider that the completion of the degree is an advantage.
Many other sectors have much more demands for know-how.
Savikko says that the financial sector's recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because the investment expertise is then guaranteed.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisers earn several thousands of euros per month on average, including commissions, natural and income premiums.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly wages are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in the field earn over EUR 5,900 per month and women over EUR 4,500.
The tenth of the most earned earns an average of about EUR 8 100.
The tenth of the most earned men earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, the tenth of the most earned women earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act may be provided only by a licensed company.
Up to now, the level of employees and tasks has been trusted in self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by Fiva received individual cases in which the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the consultant’s activities.
In principle, a seller of investment products can also act, even if professional skills and qualifications are at a heap level.
On the basis of this, the situation has been wild and free.
Sakko says that many other sectors have much more demands for know-how.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II) will be reinforcing this.
It requires that each undertaking is responsible for the competence of the investment services providers.
Financial supervision, for its part, may decide what to know.
Fiva’s market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is a regulation on the requirements for the skills and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the own staff of investment firms and to the related agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court reports that, according to the proposal made by the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is given the authority to determine knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided with these views in the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to demonstrate this that this has also been done.
The Court states that, for example, in practice, the company must identify the staff's performance at the individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different levels of requirements, depending on whether it is investment advice or sales of products.
According to the Court, a new requirement is also to work with someone more experienced in the absence of a sufficient level of expertise or experience.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
According to the Court, the change will make the rules tighter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra's persistent beach schoolers don't give a moment of rain or sunshine - Iines Allkone's polish with the help of the swimming masturbating village
Iines Allkonen made a good move, Taina Weeping followed.
Imatra Beach Schools are running on Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though it rains and then roastes again, young swimmers are not mosquito, the lover of the swimming schools Taina Itkonen.
In swimming schools this week there are a total of 13 children, a tenth of them next week.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that then already started school and eskari, itkonen evaluated.
The Imatra Beach School, in cooperation, organises the Sport-Joint Project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the Litee beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun shook and young swimming schoolmen practiced staying on the surface with swimming pools, someone already without it.
In the water, smaller sisters also enjoyed.
Iines of All, 5 first thought to go deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to sneak towards the beach.
It's fine!
Iines Allkonen told me she was swimming a lot this summer.
The beach of the apartment is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkose, the swimming pool practiced the swimming in a long time with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be satisfied with today's achievements, the swim teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 again, sometimes wanted to go to a water war.
Her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 swimmers, Ilona Villberg, holds the beach school as a good start for swimming teaching.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has always liked to leave here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Bad schoolmen packed up on the dock.
The boys had enough stuff with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread the towels on the dock, nailed fruit and cooked the day.
Already in water, the teaching continued, but there was no hurry at the dock.
It's like it doesn't belong to the summer.
Unknown soldier sells toilet brushes, "This is the same story that combines"
You can see all kinds of things.
The Blue product made cleaning products launched a series of unknown soldiers a few days ago.
I mean, laundry brushes and laundry brushes, and "wc brush on the edge brush."
In this autumn, an unknown soldier refers to the film that he received and the marketing of the film.
Nevertheless, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been spoiled in social media: When will future unknown health relationships?
I have to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does the Vice President of the Blue Product say?
We're a film partner.
We're supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Määttä.
He said that the products would be specialized, so that the film would be visible.
Isn't this something a little funny often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, here is a similar unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish basic values as those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
And cleaning isn't a stranger for military culture, that's what I'm saying.
Other business partners in the unknown soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, the Hartwall vichys, which are known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been marketed.
Unknown products are already recorded by Finland's Image magazine blogist Kalle Kinnunen
There are also coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there's still time for the movie's first night, so there's still a promise.
For example, the Valio, the Processor, the Liquid and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen, have not yet revealed their war products.
The new results of the age tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the medical tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tests were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not all consider them reliable.
The Swedish National Law Medicine Agency started the test earlier this year.
The tests will be able to assess the age of the asylum seekers more closely. A new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
To date, the Immigration Agency has carried out 6,880 tests, and the Legal Medicine Agency has now published 2,481 test results. The tests were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
In 2002, 80 % of the tested asylum seekers were identified as over 18 years of age, and 25 cases were identified by the Legal Medicine Agency as "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seekers were "possibly less than 18 years old".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age declared by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Legal Medicine Agency reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The numbers are fairly consistent. There are no significant differences in statistics over the past months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were identified as over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants had lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and reported that in 442 cases there were "indications that the subject was 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used for tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee bones. Then dentists and radiologists analyse the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolian Institute, whose work involves the assessment of human biological maturity. The assessment can determine whether the age of burglary has become normal before or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right way.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not sure to determine the age, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to Metro.
However, Göransson, the Legal Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is the largest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old, and then the risk is about 10%."
Happiness collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than pair results in the third round spent section 30 of Mikko Ilose downwards in the European golf tour competition in Scotland.
Joyen left on Saturday at the 11th place, but found at the end of the round of the 41th place.
In a difficult wing, Ilose accumulated one double bog with three bogs.
Others had a lot of trouble.
The English Ian Poulter rose up to share the top spot with one under the pair, even though he told me that there was enough work in the umbrella.
The throat was raw, but I was hanging with and finally the day was good, Poulter's thought.
He's sharing with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and the Australian Andrew Dodt.
The governor of Western Virginia exchanges the party
On Thursday night, the Democratic Governor of Western Virginia Jim Justice announced that he would exchange the party at the Trump campaign event.
"Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today, after many prayers and thorough reflections, I can tell the Western Virginians that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke up with a rigorous applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the Republican Party registered," Justice added.
"As a producer, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points because Justice did not support the Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes said he was the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owned coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth approximately $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (NRC) issued an opinion that "the change of the Party of Governor Justice is a new attack on a democratic party that would rather build barriers than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the Justice announcement is the last retreat to a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, human-binding message," said Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the RNC in his statement to the CBS news.
Lightning seeded damage - Thursday coming even the most beautiful day of the summer
In the end of the week, more old people will also be given to South Finland.
During the past week, particularly in the central and northern parts of the country, and in the region of Real Finland.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, the lightning fires fired a number of fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the very oldest day of the summer so far.
The Ukkoskuros have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, the central and northern parts of the country as well as in the region of Varsinais-Finland have been lightning.
On the table, the lightning hit the power station of the line house, causing a small fire.
The rescue facility received a report of fire about 15 minutes noon on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in the sauna space at the edge of the row house.
The rescue facility unloaded the roof and wall to find firearms and quickly turned off the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
On the shine again, the lightning fired in the outdoor building in Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already at the full stage of the fire, and the rescue facility could only prevent the spread of the fire.
An outdoor building of about 50 square meters was burned to the ground.
In the direction of the kuop, in Rääkkyl, the lightning hit the home house again.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flaming lightning attack.
The rescue facility came to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't make a fire. Only a few fuses sneaked.
In traffic, the old one caused problems on the train between the wall river and Vasa when the lightning damaged the traffic control system.
The information on the fault was received between 8 and 9 on Thursday morning, after which the trains between them were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be fixed a little before five afternoons.
Since then, the train traffic has been able to continue normally also on a runway.
Lightning has sowed destruction across Finland.
However, the lightning has been relatively small this summer.
These springs of this summer have been absolutely deadly! assesses the meteorologist Jari Tuovinen of the Air Science Department.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the thunderstorms have been mostly moderate, but thanks to the low lightning of the summer, it also seems to many to be even strong.
This might seem really tough, but that's what it's been in comparison to this summer's old ones, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the landslides grabbed 1,700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential even for the hardest day of the summer: at about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 landslides.
If the lightning is still going on to the beginning of the night, then you can reach more than two thousand lightning, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak year was found in 2015, when the number of flashes was around 30,000 copies of the year.
By Wednesday this year the number of lightning had increased to 18,386 lightning.
So there is still something to be interesting to ensure that this year does not break the "record" two years ago.
But the Ukkoskir can expect to continue.
According to Tuovis, during the end of the week, the airmassa above Finland remains warm and moist, which is a pleasant birth environment for the lush.
The main weight of the Ukva will be shifted on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
There is a more united saddle port to the middle of the earth.
That's what Tuovise says. It's just a rare thing to say.
Coe praises Russia's "awesome" apology for the doping scandal
The world's general sports boss Sebastian Coe praised with openness the apology it described, which Russia made for the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to stop the Russian ban on participation.
Russia's general sports director Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on the evening of the World Championships that the ban imposed by Russia is appropriate and that he intends to fight with determination against doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken from the gold or silver medal at the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the public sports competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office WADA report presented evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very straightforward," said IAAF President Coe to the journalists.
"The Council and the Congress were very pleased that the Russian General Sports Union admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that they would do everything they could to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe also said he was "satisfactory" that Russia accepted the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a really constructive day and progress has been made, but the Congress supports the group's recommendation that it is not the right time to stop Russia's ban," Coe said.
"We'll have to do everything we can to normalize the situation in the next few months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupted system," he added.
Eighteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete in the World Championships in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, the leader of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient and the trainers who have been banned continue to operate freely," he told the journalists on Friday, following the presentation of the IAAF Council in London.
The production company disappointed the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film was not as successful as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If honestly said, I am disappointed, I acknowledge the film produced by the Managing Director of Helsinki Film Annika Sucksdorff Yle in the interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June it had reached fair 100 000 viewers, which is little compared to the film budget, about EUR 5 million.
No lottery profit has been made, but it is now important that investors get their own back.
If the film had succeeded better in the home country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small bursts of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring Spain from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France. This is the most expensive transfer of football.
Its possible sanctions on Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will decide on the European Football UEFA, which can prevent the participation of teams in the rated Masters League.
In 2011, the UEFA introduced fair game financial rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that the Neymar transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is in ten million dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying the sum of Neymar's colony and associating him to its star guard, as it will finance the family of rulers enriched with Qatar's oil.
The clubs may use large sums for the acquisition of players, but they must be balanced with real income sources so that football-related business is not detrimental.
The financial rules for a fair game were drawn up as UEFA President on the initiative of the French elected Michel Platin in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was fraud and led to serious problems if banks or owners were attracted their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair game economic rules moved from the bonds’ debts to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly complicated. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of fair game rules will last until 2018. During that period, the members of the clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the roles of the UEFA President scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to control the unreliable use of money by clubs.
"The rules of fair game are still in use, and we will apply them in the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for the financial rules of fair game in the UEFA, to the Associated Press news office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with one-off compensation, it can arrange the amount in the accounting for his new contract for the entire duration.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be recorded for the next five years at EUR 44.4 million a year.
According to the financial rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhab, Manchester City funded.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the company was ordered to limit its Champions League Group to 21 players for the 2014–2015 period instead of the normal 25 players.
The UEFA monitors associations that may attempt to circumvent its economic rules by raising their income through companies related to the owners of the company.
If, for example, qatarian company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA does not calculate the aid as a real result.
This happened when the UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatarian Tourism Authority to PSG was overwhelmed.
It has also been shown that some of Neymar’s earnings in PSG could be financed by the 2022 World Cup Organisation Committee for Football.
However, PSG and the Arbitration Commission have denied Neymar to make the messenger of the World Championships. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA will usually follow more closely on companies to circumvent rules.
The sources of the situation reported on Thursday that the UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news office, provided that their identity is not disclosed because they have no authority to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG’s turnover for the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542.4 million and its operating profit exceeded EUR 10 million.
The last year's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of accompanying products and game shirts.
It is estimated that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % with the agreement of Neymar.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the departure of the best player in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move. It was claimed to violate the financial rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear financial doping case for both the company and the state," said the Spanish league president Javier Tebas to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also reservations that the state will finance the football club’s activities. Arsenal is owned by American sports clubs.
"The hit is the result of ownership that has changed the football environment completely over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of a fair game. There are so many interests associated with the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now it's urgent: Finnish MM athlete coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulah ja kolmionist Kristina Mäkelä Coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although he should train the general sports at the London World Championships.
Kristina Mäkela may have to compete without the advice of his coach.
The Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in a long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in a three-mile run.
However, the two coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the British embassy without results.
The coach has the invitation of the World Championships organizers as a document, but he has not been able to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He's always been able to handle visas himself successfully, but now there's some problem.
He'll do everything he can to get to the place.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sport Union SUL for years.
It doesn't mean that much.
As long as someone looks at the stage, Arttu Pajulahti said his coach about possible outbreaks.
MM-Medal for FinlandLondon requires a miracle
The World Sports Championships will start today in London on Friday and last a fair week at the end of Sunday, 13 August.
General sports, skiing and ice hockey are the species in which Finnish banking athletes are able to take a passionate approach from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bank athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other meters.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the value races to the other, where the experience of acquiring an athlete's performance is matured to the level that the adult MM medal is truly possible.
Now there are no young athletes in Finland's small MM team, and indeed there are no machines.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can also happen.
It draws bank athletes around the TV screen and glues to follow the races, even though the London medals are solved due to the difference in time only at night.
In 2015, Finland received one pronssimital from the previous World Championships.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Langkämäki.
The darings are waiting for the Long Medal now, although another tells the results of his and other throwers in recent times, as well as the staying at the Long Medal in last summer's championships.
Anyway, the long hill stays in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, access to the final competition or make their own record is a sufficient performance.
Hope and believe in the realistic medal of Finnish general sports for the coming years to give good success in the international championships of young people even this summer.
The development of young talents and the financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but requires years of sweat work from athletes and patience from both training and bench athletes.
The Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London races will remain in history as the Uussain Bolt and Mo Farah races, not for example because of terror or poor attacks.
First Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowman Enni Rukajärvi is located in the second big air competition in the United States of Colorado.
Copper Mountain's second place is Rukajärvi's best big air World Cup.
The women's race won the US Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried with his last jump of the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and it's good now, but it's a shame that the last jump didn't go all the way.
Yes, from now on, I'm going to try again at the races, in the mind of the Rukajärvi.
In the big air of the snowboard, the competitor jumps from the jump for the species.
Viking Lin's new faster ship rolled to the port in Helsinki
The shipowner company Viking's new faster ship FSTR is very late from the schedule.
The rapid ship was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 18:00.
There was a cargo on the ship at 8:00.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least one-and-a-half hours I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the car is moving slightly, Estonian Johannes Rebane, waiting for access to the port of Helsinki, told us at 19:30.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane told me that the shipowner had brought water bottles waiting in his cars.
Viking Head of Communications Christa Grönlund tells IS that we put fire in a technical fault.
It could be repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship's leaving Helsinki a couple hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for a few hours from Tallinn's return trip.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts the traffic on the sixth road on Thursday night
The special transport is 42 metres long, from Muuko Mustola to the port during Thursday night.
The transport at 9:00 should be there by 11:00.
The police control traffic on the Sixth Road, and the traffic may be stopped occasionally.
In the case of the mosquito, the transport will proceed along the road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story is haunting both the glorious days of the 1980s and the grunge of the 90s (in those times David Wain and Michael Showalter made great The State series for MTV) and their own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and the other stars of the series moved to larger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parodie and a description of the continuous memory we have caught during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's already been alive.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (for example, the story of the vegetable bulb speaking with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin was told).
The core of the joke is that middle-aged actors are acting as full-age teenagers, and highlighting it makes a part of the jokes of impossibility to achieve the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotionally based, and its parodie is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, stalker movies in the 1990s, such as horror film Hand every coat whisper.
In one section one of the characters is digging out Apple Powerbook, inline rollers and "other stuff for 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not crossed Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in a crazy run is involved Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as his criminal partner George H. W. Bush (which plays right Michael Ian Black).
As always in these series, the best sideways are.
Especially fun is to see the eternity Paul Rudd, who has underneath the bottom of the lip, the "soul patch" of Matt Dillon's movie Singles. Rudd's play by Andy, the camp king, begins to be an old guy.
The moments of random madness may raise this series as a recursive Seven Up! series, until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends will go to the Wet Hot American Summer first night.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series again appeals to another type of nostalgia: The Americans series of cold war spirit, Atomic Blonde film and even GLOW series of prints, where the east faces the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, where the Bukarest cops fight for truth, atheism and marksism-leninism.
Most of them as a hard-faced Gregor and idealist Iosefina are seen by Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulici. Their voices have dubanized in English Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's not much more.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching the TV as the Americans look at football).
There are a number of famous musicians, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the comrade detective is too caught in the imitation of a thorny socialist drama, including the killer hiding behind the Reagan Naam, which is why the series often starts to feel like a thorny propaganda.
Six long periods are too long and the series’s humor is not fast enough and not rich enough.
The merged series could work better as a agitprop saitier, even when Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly visiting the US Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby in a steep hamburger.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Roman creators of the series were not wrong: we drove our own near history and their history as well.
The Kouvolan Toni Tauru will rise to the ring in Macau on Saturday, opposite the former UFC fighter.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone on Macau, because Leandro Issa in Brazil was still in the UFC organization last year.
Brazilian also has the black belt and the world championship of the species.
Once, I'll fight against myself older than I am.
That's funny, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvian had to get up in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled because of the logistical problems, but three struggles were made in a quick timetable for the Autonomous Region of China in Macau.
That's not what I've seen before.
This was the first time my game was cancelled.
It was annoying, because preparing and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time was given for the fight.
Waiting for a week will hardly affect preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition because it does not improve every week.
The condition can get worse if you practice too much now.
In a few of its previous struggles, the Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are in the verticalization.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I'm guessing he'll be on the first lot and try to take him to the carpet.
He's won the world championship, so he knows how to push.
The Kouvolan last match didn't work according to the plans.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained on the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eye angle.
It was a very long time ago.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some of them get more frequent in the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
There were three matches last year on the steep.
Now there's the second fight in the last year.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've been training in the last few years, and I've been in good condition all the time.
But I've been fighting for a fight.
When 32 years old heard about the coming meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo, and I got to make the joy back.
We got really good training when there was a guy from Sweden too.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Kouvian will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been trained against the same size of opponents and I've been able to practice the fight.
Being able to fight is the main tactic of 32 years old.
We have to beat it in a reasonable way.
If there's an opportunity, of course, I'm going to take you to the property myself.
Lower exports should not be given free of charge because they are most consumed.
Macao is attracting Tauru previously taken in China.
I hear it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great night ahead.
The Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
It is expected that the Bank of England will announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been uneven and the slowdown in inflation has ceased speculation of interest rates.
The Central Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue slowly.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to hold interest rates at 0.25 per cent by 6-2 votes. This month, the interest rate was less supported because economic growth has been uneven.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank decreased its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that the income level of households is facing increasing pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to rise by 3 per cent in the autumn.
According to the Bank, interest rates are needed in the coming years to mitigate Brexit's accelerated inflation, and the Bank also announced that the borrowing costs could be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw some of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the post-brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide cheap funding to banks more than GBP 15 million, i.e. a total of GBP 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision states: "The Commission for monetary policy forecasts that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years when the decline in real household incomes will reduce consumption."
As far as interest rates are concerned, the Bank reiterated the need for a "slightly tightening monetary policy" of market expectations "a bit wider".
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that possible increases were "step" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted 1.9% growth for this year and 1.7% growth for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
The red fell to the dollar and to the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31; compared to the euro, it decreased by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken after the expected weaker growth figures impeded increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to grow slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little hope for rising inflation and low wage increases in households, and the Bank said that the situation would worsen even before it became better.
The Bank added that monetary policy can't prevent a decline in income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to "reasonably" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of weak pounds, which will remove part of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was taken a year after the rate of interest was reduced to 0.25 % after the result of the EU referendum, which led to a fall in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to be seen in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the most recent decision of the Central Bank, interest rates had started to be demanded more and more loudly when inflation sparkled pressure on households. Three decision-makers called for a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation decreased last month to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will again rise in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the overrun of its target level of 2% was due to weak weights as a whole.
"Bearing in mind the recent fall in swap interest rates, competition in mortgage markets would seem to be exciting even more when lenders apply feverly for customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to end, with more popular new contracts, low interest rates and unused alternatives."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV medicines
Since September, patients can be prescribed a "reversible" anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute on the funding of the medicine in the UK Public Health System (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention therapy (PrEP) is prescribed for approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Prior to contact, a drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection in individuals with a high risk of approximately 86%.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Justice maintained the Supreme Court's last year judgment, which states that NHS is able to pay for the PrEP medicine, although it claims that local authorities should finance it.
On Thursday, the British NHS Director Simon Stevens called the notified decision for a "new significant intervention" and the national AIDS organisation described it "a crucial moment".
The sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive notifications for an experiment that extends to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full range in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure contraception (PrEP) should be taken prior to intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Pre-treatment means that there are sufficient medicines in the body during treatment that prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transsexuals and people with a HIV-positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose the conditions for the experiment to meet applicants for men, women, transsexuals and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered for general doctors can also apply for a trial in their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million, and this week the British NHS signed a contract for medicinal products following an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance the existing diverse and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV," said Stevens.
"This is another significant achievement in the ongoing struggle for over 30 years in addressing the greatest health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PrEP is properly directed to the needy and risk groups, it may have a reversible effect on the British HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, the risk group members receive a medicine that they can decide on independently without need to negotiate with their partner through the NHS-funded experiment. It has an effective effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was the welcome news."
"Now it is most important to ensure that the experiment is started quickly throughout the country and no one in the risk group will be excluded from it," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP medicine used in the trial has been purchased and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people in risk groups from HIV infection."
"The start of the PREP trial is a welcome event, which lasted in vain for several months due to the slowdown of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reversible effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
Testing helps us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of life: Intermediate layer and smart interior solutions have made a home suitable for the small Earl's Court
The former banker Joanne Leigh, inspired by the renovation of real estate, moved from Knightsbridge's residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is in the first floor of Queen Anna's age style house. The success of Remont tells me that Joanne has not yet packed up and moved.
"This time I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something similar to my price class.
I went to the apartment show here and noticed that the rooms were as high as my apartment at the time.
I loved it right now and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square feet has experienced a complete change in shape.
It was a two-bedroom where only the kitchen came into the bedroom. Joanne wanted more storage space and the middle floor so that the room height could be used.
"I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired an Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to use almost four metres of high room space and create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale destination but a home.
The height of the room was not entirely sufficient for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build a middle floor where you could stand.
The solution required Erfan to think creatively.
"The steel structures are rather complicated.
The holdings had to be overlapped so that they do not need to ride.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just appropriate both on and below."
Erfan was able to place two fully-high rooms overlapping with fascinating details.
The intersection opens the Retrouvius copper-stained window into a stylish living area.
Mirror golden furniture, silver hosts and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor look beyond the real.
The intermediary mirror in the kitchen is like a window with a view of another room.
The entrance mirror-surfaced furniture has storage space for Joanne's ateria and glassware.
The fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used is more stylish.
Kitchens equipped at the door are not a new solution,
But it's unique in Joanne's kitchen that the door is lifted up in the same way as the door of the garage.
"It required a little design," Erfan tells me about the steel-reflecting MDF door.
"It's balanced, i.e. it slips very easily when it lifts its seats."
With reasonable space use and storage, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better base solution.
"When selling the property, the area will be determined – or the appreciation of the property," says Erfan.
"In the basic case, the real estate broker walks into the apartment and lowers the price on the basis of the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added by using high quality materials that bring luxury.
"The resident is in contact with the housing materials, and emotional connection to the apartment is partly based on them," says Erfan.
"No one's attached to electric wires on the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and extra squares can make the basic building exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that the apartment no longer wants to move away.
The pregnant princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's lodge hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before she was born.
A Sustainable Tomorrow event for dinner, the princess had chosen a blonde dress.
Sofia represented as a smiler on the occasion.
The Swedish princess Sofia has visited the Swedish Båstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented in the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a beautiful blue body dress, which was beautifully dressed as a pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in a dark blue housing.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before birth.
His counted time is in September.
Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress for dinner, which landed wonderfully.
The style crowned large earrings and a stylish small bag.
The pastel blue dressed nicely with the princess.
Sofia has been this week in the Swedish Båstad on a representation trip.
Sophia's been living in a small bag.
Sofia was actually radiating in his fresh summer look.
Sofia was even enthusiastic about talking to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to his last pregnancy.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, there was a hardness on the Lahti market, where Thai food was sold.
The Gulfs didn't dare taste, but walked past.
In the grocery food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the acquaintances of Panja.
He didn't know much of Finland at the time, nor did the Finns yet know Thai.
Because people didn't dare eat, Panja offered free tastes.
That's how he taught the Gulf to eat Thai food, a spring roll at a time.
Savour it, he said.
I got hooked from the valley.
I've been more and more, finally every day.
In the summer of 1997 Panja opened its Thai restaurant at the Lahde Chamber of Commerce.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the valve.
When you're hungry and places are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got better acquainted and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went on the side of the store, but then the restaurant had to change because the spices made themselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the commercial hall.
There's room.
Now we robbers are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most contagious times, we have to be shy to ask the guests if there is space next door.
Panja knows her client.
He's been told about where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what everyone eats.
He has seen how customer life stages vary and the food society changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring swing.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers what I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit down at my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange their views with Panja, who is lying in the dining room.
Food isn't the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili sauce.
He has opened our tastes in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak to him Thai thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always kind.
He's busy.
On the restaurant work he goes into the mushroom and black.
Last week, two decades of fulfillment was celebrated in the restaurant.
We customers got dessert strawberry cake.
Without alarm or attention, this important day went to work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list that was important for the fight against terrorism.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document also contains their personal data.
Of the people listed in the list, more than 130 are Iraqi, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The remaining are Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazjikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening messages told me about the list and a few weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been revised.
According to the magazine, the Special Forces of the Iraqi Army found the identity of the terrorists and the images containing the list when studying the underground base of the terrorist organisation in Mosul.
The US intelligence authorities evaluated the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was feared that something big and serious would be planned in the Western countries by terrorists after Isis had fallen in the Middle East.
In addition to the names and images of all persons, the World list also includes their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the country of origin of the person.
The list also specifies the special areas of terrorists.
For example, in the case of a 27-year-old German Sami J. on the list, the battle name is Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
It is reported that he left Germany in 2012 and traveled first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join the Isis lines.
His picture has been written in a special field as a suicide bomber.
There's no more information about the man's destiny.
Europe has gone to the rows of Isis, a total of about 6,000 fighters who are uncertain about their fate.

Brothers fight for over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria’s largest real estate empire worth more than $500 million, which is associated with their Italian family 40 years ago with a family company.
The former president and developer of the Carlton Football Society, Colin De Lutis, lives in the value area of Toorak only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. A younger brother has brought a dispute to the Supreme Court on the division of property and business assets between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family company since 2014, but there is bitter dispute.
The brothers and their mothers Anna own together 38 properties worth more than a half billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store, expanding the 160 movement chain.
The retail package was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and housing in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in suburban areas.
According to the agreement concluded with the deceased father, Colin owns about two thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as the "carrying force and central character of the family".
According to the legal documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties of approximately $316 million and Paul of approximately $1 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first optional certificate in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was first dealt with in the Supreme Court after a number of mediation companies.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says that the claim is not true, and he's accusing Paul of the poor treatment of some properties.
Colin writes one of his first faculty evidence that he would like to reach a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important thing for me," Colin says in his opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of optional statements, e-mails and reports. The case is about consulting companies such as Deloitten, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her even lost husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicious shops at the end of the 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought shops from Brunswick.
They were used as a guarantee to buy a family property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jewelry store.
Colin says he had founded a trade "in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells me that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer their properties to their sons in a sober way.
"Luigi often said that they do not want the brothers to go to court," Anna writes in her opinion.
The two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. Colin said Mark got $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "stop their departure from the economic conditions."
Colin has had a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian football club government and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to this lifetime in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and in his text message he said that he could not comment correctly, because it was dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to bring me to court and to draw the name of our family to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to the requirements of his brother.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued and said that he would continue to hope that we could find a solution.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have turned out.
"Our case will be settled in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff intends to restrict the use of the president's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly finally succeeds.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to restrict the use of President Trump's media and the monitoring of news so that the boss is not so often in trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met with the executive staff on the first working day, he spoke of a key problem that he intends to solve: he intends to restrict President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all the information – both printed and heard during the briefings – must be transported through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit the use of Trump's media and failed.
President Trump has a decades relationship with television – and as president he continues to watch a lot of television.
"If the presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was worth showing that compassionate media treated things more fairly," said Sam Nunberg, who worked as a adviser in the Trump campaign, to Politico in February.
Politico's journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at that time that "in the hands of the six former campaigners, it is essential for the management of Trump Twitter that her personal media flow includes a steady flow of praises".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's Twitter would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that we others don’t know – maybe the Twitters of Trump would have been even more intense without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff have even been able to prevent him from causing problems a few times, their work has not been for nothing.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trumpi from causing an aggravation.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their business by providing Trump with information that supports their views.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"Trump's present and former workers say that he can be extremely angry with magazines that criticize him – especially if it tells us about harmful data leaks. Then he will have to know where the information comes from.
This happened at the end of February when someone disgustedly gave the president a copy of the news of the GotNews.com website, founded by Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walshi of several information leaks in the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of the tribulation, and he had previously spread false accusations and cancelled them later, nor did he present concrete evidence.
In spite of that, Trump had started the case after he read about Walsh's staff."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary of the Human Resources of the White House, Rob Porter " had tried to introduce a system of handling of documents to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he proves to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still driving his own things.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with PSG
Brazilian Easter Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports the news office AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid the football league to FC Barcelona, which played in the Spanish League, an outlet price of EUR 222 million.
Neymar’s agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dismissed and was free to move to PSG.
The EUR 222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
PSG owns a state-owned qatarian company Qatar Sports Investment.
The company is chaired by the former tennis professional, the qatariian Nasser al-Khelaifi.
They think Neymar's coming to Paris on Friday.
Successwriter Raija Orane relayed the hypnosis of alcoholism and air fear: "I'm okay with my life"
From the TV series Rose time and Clean white sheets known as success writer Raija Orane just spent his 69th anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandmothers hold their grandmothers in such a way that Raija and her husband, Jyrki, abandoned the Spanish sun and the Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now, in spring, the rental apartment also left.
In light and sun, away from the old circles, Raijan once took depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
The external being is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin medicines were discontinued, they were mental medicines.
To alcoholism, I used to get help from hypnosis, which also did to fear of air, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orane have traveled the same trip for over 45 years.
I'm feeling better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism sector, have been together for over 40 years.
I asked, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That kind of queen of drama she has always been, stopping her life from that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen only remembers with a good 44-part of the clean white sheets of the TV series that touched and moved the depression of Finland.
I finally decided to be the business of a rich family company in the clothing industry when I read the 50-year interview with Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of the seamster myself, my mother also had a clothes shop, and sometimes I acted as a mannequin, Orane remembers.
He said that the series of things and the story changed Finnish attitudes towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's investigation and the claim revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Orane lives as a writer of active time, he has many manuscripts under work - hundreds of ideas.
The Circles returned to the "Millionary Creek"
The most wealthy household owners in the West Midlands are again with stubborn, stubborn circulators who managed to cross the doors of the municipality and return to the next field of houses.
The circulars parked 20 of their trailers near the street called the miljonaries in Solihulli.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they succeeded in crossing the city's grave of power, bringing children, horses and the army of vans.
The circulars succeeded in crossing the road barrier that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Angered residents have accused the municipality of Solihulli of "complete inability to solve the problem".
The anonymous resident tells the circulars that they arrived on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers on stones.
"It is hard to act, because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Circles were here in May, then they left but returned.
They came more tonight and probably even more today."
The resident told me that the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay the municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There's more of them before, and they've even landed a horse in a park that weeds."
According to the reporter of the town of Solihulli, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the police of Solihulli to expel the campers as soon as possible.
In order to collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police of any disruptive or criminal activity.
It will help to create a comprehensive picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angered people surrounded Portugal's turquoise
In Portugal, men full of people on the beach have been interrogated today in court.
Two people died last night as a result of the count.
Two men flying the plane can be charged with death.
In Portugal, at the lowest, you can get 16 years of imprisonment.
The small plane flying by men last night had to do a forced landing on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon because of the technical defect.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event period, some of whom ran into the water from a landing plane.
When the plane landed in a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
As soon as the plane got up, and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
On the beach, the inhabitants surrounded the small plane immediately after the turmoil, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and started to beat it, told the case by Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
Two men on the plane didn't hurt in the landing.
The tragically losing of his leg won MM gold again: "Without an accident, I wouldn't be a world champion"
Matti Great Hamari celebrated Finland's time on Wednesday morning in the World Gold Banked Slalom competition in Canada's Big White.
The Great Hamari won the MM gold cross in the races before.
All MM titles have already been accumulated.
That's awesome MM-turnout!
Two times were handled gold, a pretty good heartbeat is pulled, the Great Hamari called the phone was happy.
A 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and his very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralum board has grown and developed so much lately.
The differences are decreasing and there are lots of new calculators involved.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming behind.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in the motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been enthusiastically counting with his friends since his youth, and the accident had not taken the desire to get to the front.
I mean, it's always remembering what my life would be without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's useless to sit down.
These cards play what has been distributed, Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to dictate a serious accident and to lose the border as a lucky shot, and the Great Hamari will not do so.
But he turned to a terrible difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned to a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-fold world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Grand Hamar's largest boarding contract was already swaying.
The dune towards the peak started with real action only after the accident.
When I was a kid, I practiced with the guys, and we were always excited about the X-Games.
But they were far - from dreams that dawned in some time.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere on the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a long life if I stay here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull the sleeves in my neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as a year's athlete.
Four-fold Olympic winners received their prize in the sports hall held in January.
According to Big Hamar, Star victory is an important signal to the parathleists.
It was really big, and the victory was definitely deserved.
I'm sure this will also open the eyes of the parachute world.
When is it time to launch a double world champion Matti Grand Hamar's year's sports campaign?
It'll be seen at some point.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Still, Great Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he desires.
Next year, a big goal.
A year later, the Paralympics will be in South Korea.
Let's go get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study explored the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isaac from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
Trump's government does not see any change to the Syrian conflict.
The communication agency chain Burson-Marsteller explained the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the views and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study explored the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents can expect to return to their home country and 4 per cent could not say.
According to the study, the most recent war in Syria, as well as the presence of Isaac in the country, influence the decision of young people to return home.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in the permanent return to home, while the most important part would be to leave IS.
Only less than one tenth of them raises the key factors that influence the decision to improve the economic situation or to leave Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone does not resolve conflict
The Syrian youths were asked what is the most important factor for the resolution of the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter considers the President of Al-Assad to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Nearly half of them experience the need for both political and military solutions to end the current Syrian conflict.
Only a fair quarter believes in solving the conflict by means of military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugees sees the power of Isis weakened in the last year, while the fifth is experiencing its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Isis, and generally against terrorism, is that the media should provide people with information that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly one was a priority for military measures and training reform.
A fair tenth thinks that it would be most important to create jobs that are better paid for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump period.
There are two divisions in view of whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time code data to keep the web in order - the database he develops using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the "the fastest growing" open source database.
Coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius's final product MariaDB does not pay the users anything, and it can be developed via the Internet by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
Using databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, for example, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the technology manager of MariaDB, spends about half of his time code data.
A man who works remotely from beautiful hands will make sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database with MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, the software dumped Oracle would lose Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal happened, most of MySQL developers announced that they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who did not give a certain promise of MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
He had already founded a company that began to develop MariaDB at this stage.
He didn't want his life work to die.
I hired the best 20 developers from Sun and thus ensured that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends that created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
The Foundation was set up to supervise the development of the MariaDB code.
"In the course of MySQL, these checks have not been made," Widenius grudges.
Although many have heard about Widenius and MySQL billions, few Finnish people know anything about MariaDB.
"The last few years our growth rate has been around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CEO of MariaDB.
The MariaDB focusing on growth does not yet make any profit, and Paqvalén is scarce about the company's key figures.
To that extent, she reveals that MariaDB is estimated to receive orders for EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may be more than a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL the exchange to MariaDB will be successful in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia DBS are MariaDB’s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to its customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we've got connections to the biggest players.
"There are among our customers the world's largest teleoperators, gambling companies, banks and even some central bank," Paqvalé's list.
The database markets are still in the hands of giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest sivugeschäft compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although, according to the Gartner research company, the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, as measured by turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, even if they are growing rapidly.
About $50 billion in the database market, the open source databases are not even up to a billion.
However, the weight of the open source cannot be measured only in money because most users do not pay for any of these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged to open or at least the transition would have begun.
Large companies will not receive new customers because most of them will choose the next open source code.
This has led to the fact that license fees for commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius thinks.
Since the exchange of a closed database is a problem, most of the customer companies have sucked up prices in a listening manner.
"There are many customers to whom it is really difficult to move because their old applications and others are closed in the database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the customer's getting full.
When license payments rise every year, the customer will sooner or later transfer to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants.
Moreover, many companies face major system changes when transferring their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now intended to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros per year from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more effectively," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is concerned about how money is being spent in Finland, for example in closed health care systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make the code.
The community helps and does something that is not invented or able to do.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to the most famous open source promoters, Linus Torvalds, another Finnish Linux developer.
Widenius helps other companies develop operating business models on an open source code.
I still hold 4-5 speeches annually across the world on this subject.
Italy tightens its attitude towards NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs who will rescue refugees in the Mediterranean from their ships that they may not continue their activities unless they undertake to comply with new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new policy, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities," said Minister Marco Minniti in the interview with the Torino La Stampa message.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities had confiscated the ship of the German Youth Rettet Association, which suspected that the crew had cooperated with human traffickers who promoted illegal immigration.
For only a year, the assistance organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us. We are very sorry that we are currently not able to act in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in its opinion on social media.
"We can only assess the accusations after we have gathered all the information we need and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Youth Rettet platform since October.
It is suspected that the crew had taken refugees on board at a boat level directly from the shipowners who re-embarked the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast, and the information is published in the report of the prosecutor, published by the Italian media.
It is suspected that the crew has threatened the Italian Coast Guard to monitor the rescue operations in the region, and the motive is the enthusiasm of helping.
According to the operating instructions, ships like Iuventa must be involved by an Italian policeman who controls the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to comply with the policy: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that new rules were unnecessarily but acceptable because they did not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the operating instructions, there is a Nobel Prize for Medical without Borders.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants entering Italy has declined sharply over the last few weeks, which he considers as an indication of the fact that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local city leaders are beginning to produce results.
"The last days have begun to show light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He revealed that the plans for this month were to continue discussions with Libyan city leaders on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
The seasonal worker is suspected that he killed his open mate at Enontekio, the suspect was found in the countryside - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekiö Kuttase last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish husband.
Previously, we have been told that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect would have fled to land with two dogs after what he did.
The man was found coldly on the ground, and he didn't make a resistance when he caught him.
We'll have to raise the charges in less than a week.
The case may be covered by the Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and All Haired Friends, is dead.
British actor Robert Hardy died at the age of 91.
The actor's death announced this family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started her actor's career at the 24-year-old theater.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is especially reminded of the role of the magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter movies, as well as his veterinarian, James Herriot, in the All-haared TV series of my friends.
A total of seven of BBC's popular series were described.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text messages instigated by suicide.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced for two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that were considered to have triggered the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, takes 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years of parole.
Carter was sentenced to murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at the meeting on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter brought an amendment to the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened by 20 years of sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream-coloured sweater, listened to his judgment with his hands on the cross with a crying look on the ground created.
"He killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said.
"He decided Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown regret."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was due to "reasonable circumstances that Carter regrets deeply."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz was of the opinion that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The prosecutor read the statement of Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, where she told me that "no day's lasting that I would not mourn my beloved son's death.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can survive all this. I am trying to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was "surviving" the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding and not be an aunt for her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never last," said Camdyn.
The case seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that suicidalism is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the car to be invaded dead in 2014.
The case brought national attention when it became apparent that in his text messages Carter had encouraged his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Bring yourself, jump from the roof, stick yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was at the time on vacation with his family.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared experts' views.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion letter saying: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: You interacted with Russia the worst then the cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated,” commented NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I believe that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in CNN's interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, particularly since the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014, and due to the continuing instability of Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions are not extorted.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can enter into political dialogue with Russia to avoid the exacerbation of the situation and the new cold war.
Before commenting on Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump found that the US and Russia had reached even a dangerously poor level.
Trump urged to thank for the poor conflict between the countries, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the back hit experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced, BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
BMW's director said that the company believes that "there are even more reasonable options than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown in Munich, which consider limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about a callback.
The use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States has been highly marketed by European car manufacturers to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
The emissions of nitrogen oxide from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emissions neutralising equipment is rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being involved in large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s errors. Volkswagen installed deception devices in cars that reduced emissions in accordance with the regulations. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Many Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but the conductors are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi Motor Engine Development Department, who was responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be transferred to the United States for possible trial.
Previously this year, Audi was included in the Volkswagen criminal investigation. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system that could circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the proportion of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
On Venezuela's vote began a fraudulent investigation, big demonstrations in the promise
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least a million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result, Mr Tibisay Lucenan said to the journalists of the National Election Board.
Maduro assures the end of the crisis
A representative was elected in Venezuela at a disputed vote on Sunday to amend the Constitution of Venezuela.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organized it against protests.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to the El Pais, the national security forces of the country began to take over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday night.
The forces are intended to ensure the security of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens Provence Laventel
Laventel has become a symbol of the region of Southern France Provence, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavendel had decreased due to dryness and insects carrying diseases. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a fevery solution to the problem.
"The Lavendel is actually a threat in the Provence region because it has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change. As a result, the rainfall levels in spring and in particular in autumn have declined significantly," says Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM Research Centre in Provence.
"This shortens the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small deposits that spread microbacteria into the region."
The stakes are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient in fragrances and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed, weakened or completely missing," says Chaisse.
"In other words, parts containing essential oil are less and less."
The solution is sought by intensifiing irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and injecting plants with a mixture of spawning and water, and developing more durable varieties of drought.
Journalist's murder manifests a growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the Riodoce message once a week usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the journal handles the latest cases of organised crime, corrupted authorities and endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss which is safer: leave the children home or take them into the delivery where a granate attack was made in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front table of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask suppliers for names for each group. There is no need for evidence, observations and knowledge.
The table contains the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the pay lists of government or drug cartels, and they are criminals who make Mexico's chaos life-threatening news.
According to the journalists' protection committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto entered the office in December 2012. The federal protection of 589 journalists subjected to attacks and threats has been murdered in the past year, at least seven journalists in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder of Riodoce, the journalist and the source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote one of his many books dealing with drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The public page of the Riodoce building covers a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture says: "Justice". Thirty journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts, which are decorated by Valdez's smiles face. Valdez has glasses and a branded panta hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death. Journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness and paranoid fears.
In 2010, the federal prosecutorship was established, in particular for dealing with journalist cases, but, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been brought to date.
Journalist murderers are rarely brought to justice, as are thousands of murders in connection with drug trafficking and organised crime every year.
The journalists of Riodoce intend to continue writing about Sinaloa’s violence, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is only a little useful because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is really wasted time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the reason for the event."
Valdez had withdrawn from Riodoce's delivery in the state capital in Culiacan in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota only a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The amount is probably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove out Valdez's car and crashed it a little far away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourning his wife and two adult children.
The rumors are moving fast and freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a mouse silence.
Sinalo has been the most bloody battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January. Contesting groups want to fill the vacuum.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death daily, and the cemetery has decorative two - layer graveyards of drug barons that are larger than many homes.
In the coastal state, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was very aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published the interview by Damascus Lopez, leading a competitive group that is in war with Guzman's sons.
The case may have made Guzman's boys angry: the suspected customers bought every number of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the second publication of the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues were no longer able to fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. The newspaper's shares were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinalo, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem", says Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine began to feel about its courageous and honest things, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard class research journalism without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by the newspaper of things that nobody else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the award of the International Press Freedom Committee for its courage to follow the Mexican history of drug trafficking.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the reporters' protection committee award.
In Sinalo, the drug trade is "the way of life", Valdez said in the interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The messenger must accept him a falling mission – or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here — why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce’s staff need Valdez – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They need a friend who always got a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always used the panama hat.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines came to his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how best they can do their job and stay alive.
"The criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking resorts.
They were left out of the case," Bojorquez says.
It meant, even in the best case, strong self-sufficiency and self-protection,
trusting your own instincts.
If it feels like it's not all right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to the reporter of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, that "the impression can betray, and that happened in the case of Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinalo, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where the Riodoce security training was held. A few days earlier, it had been revealed that only the spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had been searched into a tree's shadow to protect them from 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce premises located in a four-storey building in the middle class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists wondered half of their plays whether these two police officers belonged to the 50% that the governor of the state considered unreliable.
It had been months since journalists had been in a mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
This week, Riodoce's delivery planned three main issues.
The boxing size of Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinalo.
The magazine also intended to reveal that the government's money was focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor’s office, was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in the favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician of a powerful institutional revolutionist party (PRI).
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have received a great deal of publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about past cases in the same place, one of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid the military ride.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they could get reliable information from Valdez's column about the kidnapping.
"Previously we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received a small body structure because of its favorite name "El Flaco", Ohukainen.
"Now all the connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse where the signs and labels against the persecution of journalists are preserved. The workers of the magazine have been given a new, unexpected job: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
The following morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs to the presence of the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration, which was the reason for another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West Michoacan state three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country. In protests, "SOS Press" texts appear in the corridors and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of the espionage and killing of journalists because they told the truth.
Since then, he has asked for him to be removed from government cases, because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, the authorising authorities and indifferent society.
In its last book Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drugs kill journalists, but they are also killed on the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Article 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
Murdering has a depressing effect.
No one will forget the death of a blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
At his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my writings."
His cut-off head was next to the computer's keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to stop their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of Miroslava Breach.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on its front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have fled from their states or from the whole country.
It's a hard decision.
It's hard to find work in escape, and we need to be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals searched for a journalist, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — who was supposed to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking is scared.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, the Riodoce journalists sat in front of the delivery on Friday at midnight with a beer on the pedestrian hall when the latest number of the magazine had been completed.
In the shooting between competing gangs and security forces at Mazatlan's shore site, 19 people had died.
The war accelerated, as promised in the messages of the cartel found in the area.
Journalists put the news on the Riodoce website from their smartphones.
The front page was to be redesigned the next day.
Sirenes swept in the vicinity — a new shooting scene again.
Bojorquez would look at the delivery police:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive picture, in which the man shows the middle finger to the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even think of terminating the operation. "How could I stop the magazine when our intern asked to get on the street to do the case even the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannise's Olympic project started with a huge back attack - "Good place"
In April, the Hannu Mannise party, which was 39 years old, was short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the exercise period began catastrophically when Manninen became ill with flu.
It began a long period of sickness, which was almost five weeks long.
May went practically completely ill.
First, there was flu, and finally, there was a childhood disease like an ear infection that I had to eat an antibiotic cure.
I could only make ten percent of the planned exercises.
I don't remember when I've been so sick for the last time.
It was a hard place when I couldn't get used to practice, Manninen tells the evening-Sanoma.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion received an internship permit only during the second week of June, as shown in the Competition and Top Sports Research Centre held on 12 June in KHIU's unrolled test.
In the test, the athlete skies with rollers with a mattress that speeds up every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the athlete’s finger head with a needle.
Last autumn, I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I stayed only 28 minutes.
Come against the wall, Manninen tells me.
Better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says she's staying healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises in which I have tried to normalize the metabolism of the body.
Now there's a really good five-week period behind.
There was also a week and a half vacation for a flight job.
I had time to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti MM homes.
The best result was seen at the opening competition immediately when Manninen rose to the 18th at the top ski.
Guideline drawn
Manninen and the main coach of the country team Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We're now looking for different rhythms compared to last season.
After the first race, Rulla would have a weekend for three World Cups.
In December, it would be intended to be involved at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully then you'll find the name on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Olympics of Pyeongchang would be the sixth Winter Olympics for Mannis.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002 gold in the team competition celebrated a nummela subline.
The dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, the researchers have revealed the first research results of a horn - sized being found by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it Mona Lisa.
It had remained so good that the researchers could even define that its thin skin was red and had had a "problematic past".
According to the Current Biology magazine, it has been the best of all times to maintain a pansered dinosaur and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The fossil recently found is a nodosaurus, which was in the middle of the period of addiction 110 to 122 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the pansered vegetarian is the best fossil in all times.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the Colloque was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was excavated from a block of 1,100 pounds.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you scream your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says Scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It remains in the history of science of dinosaurs Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The skin’s studies found that dinosaurs eating meat were likely to be a significant threat to this plant, even though it had a tank and it reminded us of a walking tank.
Its red-white armor was masked against its sanctuaries, and it was also protected from darker and lighter colouring underneath, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, greater dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old nodosaur rose to the titles in May, and it is now being sampled at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Researchers have given it the name of Borealope markmitchelli museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell belonged to the team that took over 7,000 hours to dig out a dinosaur.
The nodosaurus has remained so surprisingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body's intestines and armour.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloration, where the body is darker and underneath lighter.
The observation was still a surprise because Borealope is significantly larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that dinosaurs eating meat captured it to the extent that evolution favours a means of survival rather than a battle.
Of the current animals, for example, the herbs, the zepros and the armadillos have similar colours, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, indicating that the nodosaur was seriously threatened.
"The capture of a large, strongly pansered dinosaurs tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs were during the adjuvant period," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the nuts of organic compounds reveals that its skin was red.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to make conclusions about its life, including the content of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe it fell into the river when it died and drove into the sea where it fell back into the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go far further than today.
"This nodosaurus is really important because its thin leather has been preserved and it has also remained in its original form in three dimensions," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early marriage period.
It doesn't require much imagination: if you chip a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
The season was the era of teropods, huge two-legged dinosaurs eating meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have caught this pansared dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six - to - ten - tenth monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was rinsed into the sea after his death and mummyed into the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved pansared dinosaur with its skins and pansars from the swelling to the hips.
Nodosis was an average of five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
They raised two half-metre stitches from the scenes.
Researchers believe that this pansered vegetarian went through the present Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has kept small details in the underground grave.
Its fossilized residues have been so well preserved that its leather remains on the pitted plates of the pansar along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a stay is "as rare as lottery gain.
The more closely it looks at it, the more surprising it feels.
Its fossilized leather remains in its fossil plates.
Its right edge is on its side, five toes upwards.
I can also count the fog of its base."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Who are the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home from St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment in bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed a young 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street."
He was surprised to note that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His time line had numerous re-twitters from the user @TheePharoah.
The user's name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the White Police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old blackman Brown in Ferguson, Missour's state.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's dead body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
He put his phone off, and when he returned to Twitter later the same night, people were told to gather up for Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police seals and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was wearing the sign: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video, where the police stood in front of the protesters with a swinging dog.
He also tells me he saw a video where another policeman pulled his guns and screamed, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers saying.
"It wasn't a murder that we've already used to and which could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 a.m. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
From what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years, a documentary film "Whose Streets?" has been made. It received its first night at the cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, strength and enthusiasm from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson's flower dress and the crown that matches it with her daughter dressed, they rediscussed how it's like to live black and under what conditions. They had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how the blacks have had to fight for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers saying to her daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't leave the daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"This day's events are the peak of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow up in it.
He must be able to become active and organisational, but he must also be aware of the different layers and conditions of the experience of living black and black. And he must know what we need to do in order to free ourselves.
Fortunately, I have been able to protect him from brutal racism, but he is still the same as the other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I were to protect him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became the camp of activists when they waited for information about the case and finally found out that no charges would be brought against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in the bags and distributed them to the minds.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activity changed completely after August 9th," he says. When he studied at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell, he was the chairman of a minority nurse student organisation. At that time, he focused on food law and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organization.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "who simply wanted to tell" what was going on.
Ferrell was thinking of a doubt, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
There were countless times of suspicion when people appeared in the local community, usually white, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and persistence.
"We had heard that the people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan recently told in the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davi, who was known to be active in death sentenced prisoners.
The involvement of Davis led Ferrell to join the project together with the other six locals. The description group followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," says Davis.
"For me, the most important thing was how local people were presented in the movie, because I was presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was wanted to show that the people's movement was "not a karismatic leader but a community".
That is why the document sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt myself a little naked," Ferrell laughs when she tells me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human description of the blacks require a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story once again brings the role of black queer women into the wider Black Lives Matter shop.
The movement was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot a black teen boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement coincided with the queer identity.
"The leadership of the queer women has kept the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to end up with everything."
Folayan agrees: "Svart women really maintain the movement, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he emphasises that Ferrelli was not selected in the document "self-reasonably" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," says Folayan.
"However, there is no coincidence that he was in the front line. Black queer women live in a lot of things, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is devoid of white cloth."
The news description groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole, and he was sentenced to blocking the motorways at the demonstration.
His description of the social political climate of its home angles is short and central: "Blasphemy."
Yet he continues to rely on the slogan that he learned outside on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our charity is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Appropriate equivalence: an artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning DNA
In the Fridman gallery in New York, faces have been hung in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces, between which, more closely, you can see the resemblance.
These 30 works are made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he executed his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of the leaking of classified diplomatic phones to the WikiLeaks website.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
Its background is two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a translative and career-driven dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced his term of office for the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzes Manning's DNA algorithmically and, based on his genetic data, creates 30 shapes. They are sharp, although a little theoretical, on DNA data adaptability, complexity and interpretation of the underlying causal and identity relationships.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly reported that she has been the same as women since she broke up, and in 2013 she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including a violation of the law on spying, computer fraud and theft.
The prison sentence of Manning was only one picture: a rake, black-white selfie, where the troubled condition Manning sits in the driver’s seat. He’s got a platinum valea peruk in his head, which became his mark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had received great popularity with the Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
That's where he created forms based on criminal data, and he got DNA data, for example, from cigarettes and chewing gums, and created pictures of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told me about the new exhibition at the press conference.
Manning was unable to visit and could not be filmed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning's DNA picture.
The artist and his imprisoned music suddenly became friends of correspondence, and they wrote each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a symposium of "Supressed Images" that Shoili Kanungo imagined. It described the future where the president would have eased Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now that Donald Trump is taking his own war against the informatics and transsexual soldiers and invents new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions that he actually had to relieve.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everyone has a purpose."
The wall of Galleries has an artist's statement and under Manning's great signature, with a heart point in the name i. In his opinion, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA episode: a long line of C, G and A written with a lead pen.
With this combination of 200 letters — or nucleotid, as the scientific definition used by the artist is included — Dewey-Hagborg wants to see how similar we are all, at least our biological.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our genetics and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also shows his 2007 Spurious Memories video work.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there are 30 of them here."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from the comic book Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
That's where Manning's character elevates from prison like King Kong, in his hand a megaphone.
"If they get you quiet, they've won," says the picture.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is about the letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he greets his own gene-based face as a crowd of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, as is the case with all the others in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA section is written with a lead pen at a height equal to its length (157.5 cm).
"The plants were previously on the wall, but I wanted to bring them into the sense of the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to picture the crowd movement that Chelsea was born, which was also behind his release."
Professor at Northwestern University and employee at Oxford University are being searched for murder as suspects
The police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee at the Oxford University who is suspected of being deceased in a chicago luxury apartment.
According to the Cook County Law documents, the arrest warrants were issued on Monday on Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleu.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after he had been stuck several times.
According to the local press release published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several cut wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and the arrest was investigated as a murder, and the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor in microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now in administrative freedom and is not allowed to take part in the Northwestern University camps.
"This is a criminal case investigated by the authorities, and the University of Northwestern helps investigate," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent as a financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail from the University and somerville College mediator, it is stated that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in all possible ways."
In addition, the opinion stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Chief of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said that he urged suspects to surrender seriously to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly clarifying our searches," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He told me that the police had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene to be awful.
Guglielm says it's unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Management Group published the following press release: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to explode the Islamic bookshop and to kill Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the judge said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to explode an Islamic bookshop in London and to " kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of serious disruption.
According to the police, the bookshop staff alerted them to the site on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had been "thought to blow up the book store and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for a threat.
The threat had nothing to do with the book store.
The authorities noticed that Moffatt was dressed with the same costume as the suspect of the book store, said the police reporter.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt said to the police in interrogations.
As a penalty, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds, i.e. about EUR 690 legal costs and 85 pounds, i.e. some EUR 95 compensation for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's reporter, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will take the WADA road map to a close in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Vitaly Mutko, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, has said that Russia will soon complete the measures under the WADA Roadmap of the World Antidoping Office to restore the powers of the RUSADA Committee on Antidoping.
"A part of the measures under the road map has already been implemented, and RUSADA was entitled to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD British Antidoping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in these parts," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map setting out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
It says it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
"Everything has been reported, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the road maps requires that the Russian antidoping authorities publicly accept the results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren by WADA. McLaren is investigating the alleged state share in Russian sports doping.
That's what Mutko said: "Research is underway because our antidoping system has admitted the failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot admit what was not in existence."
The words of Mutko were echoed by the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian Independent Public Antidoping Commission.
Previously the same day, Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there had been problems in the Russian antidoping system. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and provisions in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop the doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, the head of WADA Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow. After a visit, he found that the organization was "on the right road" towards the restoration of powers.
The British organization is skeptical about loveful innovation for Finnish people: The health benefits of maternity packs "no evidence"
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, who fights hidden deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in mammary packaging in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity pack would reduce the risk of hidden death.
Hidden death means unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust serves as an expert on the British health authorities in a safe child’s sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed for them, because it would make it understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality readings in the world, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teenage inferiorities.
The fact that every family is given a box there may be one factor.
However, that cannot be said without any doubt, Francine Bates, President of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging will be marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden deaths.
The maternity packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains various supplies, such as child clothes.
This year, there are 53 products in the pack.
The pack itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes distributed by it meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for carton boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no cot or bed available.
The organization recommends that the packaging be used only for sleeping days and that it be stopped at a time when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and ensuring that they do not drown or dirt.
A swift pussy ran away from a Japanese zoo.
The Japanese zoo staff are looking for a escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and have escaped once again within two weeks.
The tortoise escaped from the Shibucawa zoo in Okama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the bitch left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo, told.
Karannut 35-year-old bitch is female, 55 kilos and about a metre long.
Yamane describes the escaper as quiet and gentle.
In the open-time, the bitch is allowed to walk freely in the farm area.
The zoo has not received eyewitness observations of the turtle.
The last escape from home happened another week.
Yamane found a escaper walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in his online start-up business, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the questions were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious about them.
"The questions were simply not consistent and objective," says Errett. Madison Reed, a hair care company, focuses on online stores. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to rely on external aid.
The market has become more and more new staff management start-ups, helping other companies to find out how their employees can do it.
They develop and license software to measure the commitment of employees. Companies can make surveys and address them to certain teams and groups of people, and provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the top management of the government.
"Other health can be monitored by applications such as Stravan and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure the commitment of employees.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says he has had a deeper view of the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make quick questions and votes for certain teams, and it can also draw up a map with one eye on the areas where workers are more unhappy and who have received the weakest assessments from the leaders, and on the basis of which Errett has been able to get into the core of the problems.
The companies have understood that they have to follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. Around the transport company has collapsed since the former worker wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and people talking about problems are punished.
For startups such as Glint, such negligences are attractive business opportunities.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a global industry that, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can rise to over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, located in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate use. Interest in the company increased earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced an attack.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently also made a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent will allow companies to make customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time and identify problems areas.
In addition, employees can anonymously report inappropriate behaviour by SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect the director of inappropriateness, the complaints will go directly to the company's government.
"The general opinion has removed the authorities," says the founder and CEO of Convercent Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if the company treats its employees poorly or inequality, the consequences may be expensive even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers may start boiling the company, and it may also lose workers and be challenged in court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the principles and procedures and can easily get access to the headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out a phone number or email address that could make a notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and uncomfortable experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Legal Director James Vitrano. He said it was difficult to follow complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems were hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, tribulation and unfair wages can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who is the leader of the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"In the same way, we protect our shareholders from trials relating to working relations."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after the collapse of the audit firm Arthur Andersen in connection with the Enron scandal as a result of an immoral activity.
Only with social media did companies understand that they could no longer prevent the public treatment of their dirt wash.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into ethics control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service that is charged regularly.
It is a business model and a possibility accepted by capital investors, both Glint and Convercent have support for capital investors.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has collected a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has collected a total of $60 million.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and risk capital.
A number of studies show that workers expect more from their workplaces.
Good wages in competitive markets such as the hiding valley, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"The employees are more committed to the success of the company if they are enjoyed in the company and feel that they are listened and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, director of the LinkedIn company responsible for rewarding and well-being of employees.
Investors get profits when companies are successful, companies are successful when employees are engaged.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen the commitment of workers, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to the experts of the workplace culture, information on the commitment of workers is important,
But it is useless if measures are not taken.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if there is no change enough quickly or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be ready to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, Director of the Management Consulting Company, Kotter International, who has seen companies trusting too much to collect information.
"If the company doesn't take action, the workers are starting to wonder if they were heard
And whether their opinions matter anything.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently making monthly staff questions and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from frustrated workers on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday better understands its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the sustainability of staff in the long-term sector known for the high change in employees.
"If the company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of encryption of his naked woman's neighbor, reports TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come away from her home from the shower when she had noticed outside her window hanging on her cell phone at the end of the tail.
She said the cell phone camera was filming the apartment.
A woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress up.
When a woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but soon after it was counted into the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of a camcording has admitted to having photographed a woman.
However, he claimed that he only pictured a woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been deleted and the police had not been able to return it to prove it.
In interviews, the man has admitted the act, but he has denied that he had committed a crime.
The man he described was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor as a "heavy mad."
According to the TT news office, a man is being charged with the case.
Teachers demand more light in autumn negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than for example in the export industry, but the difference should be reduced, said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in the public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements which would not in any way involve any cuts in the holiday money.
In the municipal sector, agreements will only arise after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Lukas predicts that, for example, OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
Proportion targets Luukkainen hasn't yet revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a publicly trained negotiating organisation.
Lukasinen: Holiday cuts increase earnings differences
According to the OIOS, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is decreasing at the same time as the purchasing power of private sector increases.
According to Lukas, a fixed-term holiday operation further tightens the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, the number of students per teacher may be:
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as differences between the best and the weakest are growing.
According to the scheme, learning results are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly growing.
The day of Bruins’ players increased when NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening. A bunch of UCLA American football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the campus.
Some of them have taken off their game shirts, and their backs are shining out of sand after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of training, players at the University’s summer courses will return to the campus to read the final tests. The next morning, they will meet at the Waterman Football Centre at half seven.
"The following three days will be hard for these friends," Bruins coach Jim Mora says a little before Monday turns to Tuesday.
The university tour organisation reduced the number of daily exercises from two to one. The change was intended to reduce the number of players’ work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the last final tests were held.
That is why the first three exercises at UCLA began in over 15 minutes at night. It was already difficult for players to find space on their full schedules.
Restricting training rates in one day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six-way coaching period in Westwood when exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
Exercises are to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the season opening game begins: UCLA meets the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported NCAA's change of rules, even though it made players' schedules even more stringent.
"We really do much for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll make it easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the field of practice to the next parking area and Lusk Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with footballs flying over the rooftop of the rooftop.
Bruins’ players are planning to move to the hotel the next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book the room and film the exercises from there on the video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
A lot of money is paid for the video of the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will be held in Central African Rwanda, whose winners are already considered clear.
Paul Kagame formally strives for his third season, but in practice he has influenced the management of the country since 1994.
At that time, the RPF rebel group stopped the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for breaking up the opposition and restraining freedom of speech.
He has also been accused, for example, of distortion of poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to strive because the Constitution, which was limited to two periods of Presidentiality, was changed.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment flows in the country.
In addition, Kagame has had a major role to play in the unification of the nationwide genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has promised its people more freedom since the land has been raised on its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights against illuminations by intensifiing the check of facts
Facebook intends to send possible illuminations more and more to independent fact inspectors and present the results under the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published on its website a statement that it will start using updated machine learning to identify lights. Possible lights will be sent to the facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the largest journalist of the lights. Many believe that lights influenced the outcome of the US presidential elections in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed by light news before the May presidential elections, and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to penalize social media networks if they do not quickly eliminate hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in its separate opinion in Germany that the facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"The people want to see what stories do not pass through the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what they read and share," wrote the Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su in the company blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test articles related to the topic and will also make other changes to his news input to reduce illuminations.
The Birth of the Book of Drama: The Story of a Castle
The Little Scotney Castle in the Kent County is now known from Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming castle in the Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned monkey writer.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a dead person more than 300 years ago," Rhodes says shyly.
"I know the personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the edvardian time. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, a promising British comic designer: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes archives. In 2014 he appeared from Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved to tears in the letter I noticed a thumbprint. The letter had been written by a double agent working on the Jacobites in the 17th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because then the light was used as fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on his own.
I love archives!"
The author of old documents was allowed to stay in prison for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of the Arts of England, which felt too good to be true.
He spent days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rareness, such as hyena caps hanging on the walls and centuries of bottles in the grave.
He walked through the ruins and farms of the old castle and discussed with forest guardians, gardeners and sometimes artists.
At night, he took whiskey and started writing.
The closest history of Scotney is quite unknown, since the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation's staff was only about to start through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extras to the basement.
The archives included journals, letters from the times of the empire of England, and maps of who owned anything. "Can imagine that the lands are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, however, the families fought for even one cough.
I thought I'd let it go."
Some of the stories of the book are moving from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It relates to a man who soon after the completion of the castle has joined the English housekeeper in 1381.
The "Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex" book mentions that there was a mellitus in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English houseboy poop began in the same area, and remembered that the rebellion could start from the melting.
Maybe these events are connected to each other?"
The other stories of the book relate closely to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, a story of the priest who was hiding the Darrellin family for seven years during the reformation of England.
The Smuggler again tells the smuggler Arthur Darrellin story from the 1700s. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the ark with stones (this was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrels are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been some kind of bridegrooms. They were constantly in debt and bought things they wouldn't have afforded.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as beautiful friends who were able to relieve the heir's daughter."
Now Rhodes is applying for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on Lifemill, a healing facility operating in the early 1900s, which has left only a fenced plot.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this goddamn ark yet."
You interacted with Russia the worst then the cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated,” commented NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I believe that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in CNN's interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, particularly since the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014, and due to the continuing instability of Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions are not extorted.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can enter into political dialogue with Russia to avoid the exacerbation of the situation and the new cold war.
Before commenting on Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump found that the US and Russia had reached even a dangerously poor level.
Trump urged to thank for the poor conflict between the countries, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko stops - re-fighting against Anthony Joshua will not take place
The long-term heavy series of professional boxing world champion Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
Ukrainen Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who hit gold in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought as a professional 69 times in wining 64 of the matches.
He held various MM titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career for the last two matches.
Tyson Fury scored him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and lost after the gorgeous fight at the 11th Clock.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the fight.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision so that I could get enough distance to the Wembleyn match, Klitshko told me in the press release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I got everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and unbelievable successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's reasoning for his decision on the video.
Klitshko's manager Bernd Bönte told him in the press release that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he has no longer enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating the American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, the daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
The big brother of Klitshko Vitali is also the former world champion of the gravity.
In 2008-12 the brothers ruled the MM titles of various unions at the same time.
Finland's weather breaker whispers the circumstances: "Take off"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer's outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkase has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken a woman off the rock.
The London World Championships also have unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been a slight jumper against Minna Nikka.
I wouldn't want to blame the track, but it was unimaginable that I couldn't even get the little stitches to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here knowing how many times and I have never experienced in this place with as varied wind, Nikkanen told at Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, the standardization of the jump has been really difficult, even when the exercises have had so unstable winds, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva races.
Weather talked in London on Thursday.
It's been a pretty challenging thing to get the technology together, whether it's cold or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's got rid of it.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
Thanks to his 455 hallucination, he got to the World Championships.
There's been 445 out there.
The relationship in London isn't the same for everyone.
It's gotta be slow and wait for better wind.
The aim is to go beyond 460 on Friday.
Why don't you move to practice abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was from the beginning in Italy and Germany.
I've got a jump in a bundle, and the technology's standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, the hall has been able to practice, now the hall has been closed.
What would it be like to race?
25 degrees warm.
There's a little wind, as long as it's constant.
The experienced ex-chairman discouraged politicians in general: "We don't have any space for now or for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipila must keep ice in the hat and watch out the government budget with debt money, warns the budgets for decades prepared by Erkki Virtanen at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no allocation.
In 2015, Yle interviewed retired Virta on Wednesday 1st morning.
Building the government's budget next year is just starting.
Recently, political proposals, such as the raising of the guarantee pension, the calculation of the tax on cars and the support of electric bicycles, are considered by Mr Virtanen as voting speeches.
They mainly say that the elections are beginning to be close, because when ten percent of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no allocations now and for many years.
I think it's even betrayal to talk about splitting when we take debt, Virtanen said to Yle.
Mr. Stromanen emphasised that all debt is owed to children.
The current has a long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978 he began as a Secretary of Budget at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Head of Budget.
The last time before he retired, he served as head of office of the Ministry of Labour and Industry.
In the interview with Mr Yle, Mr Virtanen pointed out that the now predicted 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a pin from which we are going to go to the footnote next year, and Finland expects one per cent increase for ten years.
Washington changes the rules of a permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of a permanent residence permit, i.e. Green Card, were amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and to restrict family visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process benefits applicants who know English and are able to feed themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the media.
The wife of the Danish queen does not want to be buried with the queen at the same place
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
On the picture Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree as described in April.
The Danish Queen Margareeta, 77, and her spouse, Prince Henrik, 83, are not buried next to each other, reports the Danish court.
Traditionally, a couple of rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's Room has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Judgment Church, the court notes on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the reason for this is the discontent of the prince in his role in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been unhappy in his role and title in the Danish monarchy, commented Lene Belleby, head of the Court of Communications.
The prince’s decision not to be buried with the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the desire and understanding of her husband’s funeral place.
Horror moment on the road: The car was coming on the motorway
Tom had an open mate and two little children in his ride.
They were not injured in an accident, but they did not receive the money from insurance if the other party was not reached.
Turma happened at Keimolanport at Vantaa.
Archive picture of the frame III building site.
Vantaa Tommi tells his family survived a miracle in a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his brother-in-law Riina and the two small children of the couple drove on the motorway at Keimolanport in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinnan.
The circle III from joining the Hämeenlinnanjoki was driving along a white car that was driving on the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without the traffic, the car would have hit Tomm.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it left hands, Tommi says.
The family's car hit the ceiling at a very fast pace.
The parents and the two little children on the back seats were not hurt.
One of the children is slightly under the age of three, the other is under the age of the year.
Apparently it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one passing the road even drives us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident happened about 17.20.
Tomm said no one stopped with them, and the family called the emergency centre.
They got out of the car with their own power.
Ambulance and rescue personnel came to the place, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to the redemption condition.
Tommi tells him and his wife who had small incomes, and they received grants from family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without another car's information, the family says Tomm won't get the money for insurance.
That is why the family hopes for sightseeing from witnesses of the car, which is why the family drove to the bay.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to the farm and work without it, Tommi says.
Tom saw the car was a white old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or from the beginning of the 2000s.
He thought the car's registration number was SIG.
If we can't get caught, I don't know how we're going to do financially, we're going to have to count every cent nowadays.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or knowing about what happened will be in touch with the police.
The East New Zealand Police Department and the Central New Zealand Rescue Department confirm that they have had to be in an accident site on Tuesday night.
The title and the case corrected at 21.15: Unlike the case originally stated, another car did not come from the frontiers, according to Tomm, but was driving from the accelerator to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppise's show deals with human relationships by means of humor - The self-discoverer will be seen at What?-theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who comes from Kouvola, brings his first-born guidance to the What? theater.
The self-discoverer is a music theatre about wrong past human relations and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppise, it's still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by means of a humor.
He says you don't stay in trouble with the feelings.
According to Jäppinen, the circulating summer theatre has been carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation challenges to consider what a person reveals himself when he is acquainted with a new person.
Is it possible that he plays a role, or is he approaching the other jacket open?
Ungettable presentation blends fact and fiction
The sticky has both controlled and dramatized the show.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the working group's texts and is not confused.
The director believes that even though the performance is stimulating the ideas of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Mr Jäppinen stresses that the Self-Discoverer does not directly mention his own or the working group's human relations.
The facts and the fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own world of values will care about the show.
I do not think that relationships would be bad, but I do not think that relationships, especially relationships, would be a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Discovery is drawing an actual picture of young adults living in Finland, 100 years old.
According to him, many have learned a lot of human relations from their parents, many of whom have separated.
At least to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay with a bad relationship.
The show shows Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
The music is a match between Jäppisen and Roka.
Love in the theater burned in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, is studying as a director of the theater term at the Art Academy of the Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years behind and there's another thing in front.
The boy's enthusiasm for the theater has begun over the years of Kouvola.
The music class educator has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has performed, among other things, at the University Children's Theatre in Helsinki and the last in the Castle Theatre in Turku.
Steering has begun to be more and more interesting.
The self-discoverer got his first night last week in Helsinki on Narr's stage.
In the future, at least in Jappise's student town in Turku, the show was about 45 minutes.
Self-discoverer Kouvolan What?-theater 4.8. at 19:00 and 5.8. at 14:00 and 19:00.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
For 20 years a hundred days a year, the Ace of the Couple ran around the world and chased the Olympic gold of his dream.
The dream was realized in 2002, but Lahtela's business continued.
He was not only an tireless intern, but also an experimental in new species.
There are probably no many forms of exercise on earth that the chemical lake would not have tried at least once.
It's been inspiring to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela had a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands broke.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked the wounds at home for a year, Lahtela says.
The bay had bad luck.
He also admits that at age, he may have had his part in vain.
You know, driving a nice ride can sound like a hurry.
But I didn't get any limits on it.
It's just as a species so hard that you don't have to do too much for this 40!
After the accident, Lahtela had a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind it was a long-distance coach for the Japanese freestyle country team.
Lahtela began to pest immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time after I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
Actually, I didn't do much, Lahtela tells me.
Even during the training period, Lahtela often challenged its protectors in the breast and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts didn't feel reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I really enjoyed it because I really had to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to be Finland's main coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd burned out.
It's easier for the body to find places that have gone apart than brittles!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started a Finnish freestyle country team as a coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speeders.
I switched the motocrosss to frisbeegol!
I mean, it's gone right away.
In the worst case, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela itself has always been a super-enthusiastic coach, he does not require his training to be the same as he.
I won't force everyone in the same fashion.
In our variety culture, there is room for one's own people and ways of becoming the best of the world.
Freestyle is free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
The sex robots are coming, and we should be worried.
It is here: a report on technology development in the sex-irobot industry – just when it had begun to feel that 2017 could no longer become stranger.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big thing now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5-10 years.
"We must begin to take serious consideration for the generalisation of sex robots," says the Foundation's founder member and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence from the University of Noel Sharkey Sheffield.
Customers can choose the type of colour of the eyes of the robot, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"The sex robots are hiding, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them more and more," Sharkey said the report at the publication.
Sex dolls have developed from blown dolls into robots with warm silicon skin and artificial intelligence features that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from eye color to teeth shape and type and color of fingernails.
The more worrying is that the robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have developed into robots with silicon skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, even as shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of the True Companion company have pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is perfectly adapted to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It might be tired, it could be in the mood of a case or it could be in the mood.
The spread of sex robots has many worrying features, replacing real human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjection of women and direct rape phantasias, when the user approaches, for example, a shy and resistant robot programmed.
True Companion compares Roxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sexirobot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex game.
The generalisation and development of them tells about something darker and deeper in our culture: the recession towards gender equality, where subjection is one of the alternatives among others.
Of course, most of the men do not get sexirobots, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the life of time.
And many begin to be strange or offensive only when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that the sexirobots have begun to become more widespread at the same time as women's rights are threatened across the world and the White House has a president who has been eager to afflict women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Your slave) is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, for example pictures of the hanged body and the excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are attempted to make as many real women as technically possible (with porn stars).
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and movements track human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — nothing suggesting independence or infringing the imagination of perfect subjection.
They are pleasant servants.
The slave.
Police suspects: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group led by the Chief of Isis
The chief of Isis was led by a group of Australian men who were suspected to plan to take a bomb to the Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person of the father’s leadership had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to doubts, the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security inspection.
The police don't tell you why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas separator and take it to a full public place, for example, in a public transport system.
Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan of the Australian Federal State says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to the suspect terrorist plans, four men were captured in the police boards on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
The good sides of Trump?
Gets Mitt Romney to show a healthy sense inheritance
The Trump season has already been repeated until tired of the fact that the strong twin division of voters has also broken up families.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory palaces of the American newspapers guided how to deal with family members who voted for Trumpi.
We're all wanted to open our information bubbles.
Less attention has been given to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was staying with me this week in New York, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has been a button with our family, the Republicans, for a long time.
He reminded me that a common enemy could have a powerful uniting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins — including the Republican sister, with whom he has been fighting politics for decades — are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dining table, it is a good thing, but more generally, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new power, but the distorting effect of his presidential union can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the scary possibility that one day we can't be able to scare his tricks anymore.
In the long term, there is even more awful chance that Trump will normalize the republicans of the right outskirts, which suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I am thinking about Mitt Romney's stubborn version of madness: a dog on the car's roof, 14% income tax (and his tax returns we have seen at least).
When the Trump season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate will only have to be clear, and it immediately seems to be a significant improvement.
When my cousin was going to visit me, we took our children to the Central Park carousel, that's the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best thing in New York to get for three dollars without coffee.
The horses of the carousel are huge, in the midst of characters — irrational clowns and animals looking behind the horror — are malicious, and the screaming music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s character circles are becoming disappointed over time: the views of the high buildings are getting tired, the city’s silhouette gets too familiar and the reality of the city does not correspond to dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I have not completely exceeded the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cabin but a large traffic circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-spirited pub, but it is not counted.
On the other hand, the central park carousel is still a strange magical experience — even to the extent that two two - year - old, one - eleven - year - old and two - fourty - year - old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately, no one came to ask.
Instead, this week, I was asked to assess my "payment experience" scale from one to five stars before I put my credit card in the reader.
The same thing in the cafe at my home corner, but there I also get the opportunity to combine with an estimate of 15% service money when I go to the coffee shop myself.
This slows down the everyday interaction and pressures the customer to put his personal in a game in a situation where he doesn't need it.
The merchant at the store smiled as a regrettable feeling when I tiredly gave my credit card to the five stars experience.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from Interne, "No trust in the management."
FC Inter has today freed Shefki Kuq from the roles of the coach of the team of representatives.
The training responsibility is taken by the former assistant coach Fabrizio Piccare.
The other training group will continue in its current tasks.
The Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, among others.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, a member of Inter's training group, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Mr Håkans, President of the FC Inter Government, regrets what has happened.
The change of coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuq had no trust in the company's management, so there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the company's newsletter.
The Piccareta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He, together with the other training team, is already responsible for tomorrow at the home fight against HIFK.
According to the news of evening messages, the team's been decaying on Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the company's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved away.
Kuqi and Piccareta were strongly brought together in the Interi match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in the 80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violin artist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in Instagram.
A number of weddings have been added to the picture to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student in the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman who looks seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's communicating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A fair year ago, he published a picture pair of himself in Instagram.
On the other picture, she's seen 20 years ago, on the other she's posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his picture text, Lampenius thinks of his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders that he suffered as a younger person.
Twenty years ago, and today...
I still look much the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to the English hashts life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
He was already 14 years old in the hospital because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulim, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
Healing started quietly.
In addition to therapy and similarity, Lampenius helped with new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital because of chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for cuts in his wrists, which he had, according to the prison authorities, fallen in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of the murder of the prosecutors for the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said they intend to complain again, for they consider the six - year sentence of Pistorius too light.
The Attorney-General intends to complain to the Supreme Court in South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with this year already.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may extend for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country announced according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested a number of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st, with two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the BTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and already impose substantial fines on all campers in areas other than those reserved for use.
The inspections shall be continued until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right could impose a fine.

Red meat, milk products and chocolate may alleviate the irritated intestine syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the gastrointestinal system.
However, a recent study argues the opposite: a high amount of meat protein and milk products diet may facilitate an irritated intestinal syndrome.
An irritated intestinal syndrome is an unhealed disease with about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom, causing stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential protein amino acid tryptophane helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerability.
According to the research leader Marco Colonna, immune cells guarded from the intestine and ensured that the harmful microbits in the food were not hidden in the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerability and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the infection, there may be an irritated intestinal syndrome.
Studies showed that there are immune cells that enhance tolerability in mice with a specific bacteria in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptophane to start the appearance of immune cells. Tryptophane is one of the protein builders.
"We found a connection between Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the development of cells that promote tolerability. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of normal intestinal microbiology," says Professor Colonna.
"The more the mouse diet was tryptophane, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and an abundant tryptophane diet may enhance the tolerance of the intestine and reduce the sensitivity to inflammation.
In studying tolerable immune cells, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraga found that although one mice group had such cells, they were not present in the same mice species that were kept separate from another mice group.
He suspected that the difference was associated with mouse intestinal microbioms, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal system of bacteria, mushrooms and viruses.
When mice intestinal DNA was studied, six bacterial species were detected in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice with no intestinal microbiomy and no immune cells developed in a sterile environment, they started to develop immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affected the immune system, growing Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferring small amounts of liquid – without bacteria – from mice to immature immune cells.
Immune cells developed into tolerable cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a subproduct of the metabolism of tryptophane known as indoli-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice nutrition, the number of cells that enhance tolerability increased by about 50%.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerable cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal channel.
It is not yet known whether tryptophane by-products can develop cells from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in humans in the same way as mice. However, there have been genetic errors associated with tryptophane in patients with irritated intestinal syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate the inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High tryptophane levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got in line with a "genius" contract with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" in line after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The middle-field player debuted Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for a pound of 40 million, started 2-1 wins in Dublin, in the last round of United, before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defending middle-field player against stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best condition yet, because he was not involved in the Asian tour before the season began. He only managed in the field for 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, it must be changed before the season of the election.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has natural football thinking skills," Mourinho says.
"We're helping him to be ready rather than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to cut its start-up composition for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the company has already done "prosperous work" by acquiring three of the four players he has placed on the top.
"Three of four – it must be thanked to the company," he added.
"I'm more happy if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Airball women tried Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's football team lost the MM-karsintaturnaus fourth match to Germany directly 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
German routine playing is high.
The same game was in every sector, the Finnish main coach Tapio Kangasniemi told in the newsletter.
In the first two rounds Finland kept its opponents close, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany's head of the block.
When we were played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to play with, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Three matches of four lost Finland will still meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The great jury has already sent challenges to the Trump Jr Russia meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to meet Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The large jury, invited by the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges to the meeting of the Russian lawyer known as Donald Trump Jr and Kreml in connection with the meeting of Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The news office Reuters, which, at the same time, confirms the information of the Wall Street Journal on the convening of a large jury on Thursday.
According to Reuters, the major jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Trump Jr and the Veselnitskaya known for the connections of the Kreml, which was held between the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There was also Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the current adviser of the White House, Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that the Special Attorney Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means a tightening of the rate of Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to help the great jury to investigate Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his neighbours were working with Russia.
The great jury extends Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify falsely.
The majority of the jurys are a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The large jury weighs the evidence that the prosecutor investigates and decides whether the charges should be brought.
A British inventor microfit himself to get home and to his car with his hand sparkling
The British inventor has first microcircuited himself throughout the country so that he can open his home outside, get to his office and start his car with a spark.
The microchip is between the 33-year-old Steven Northam’s thumb and the front finger. Now he offers services to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam BioTeq’s technology.
Northam cooperates with the Consulting Sleep Doctor Geoff Watson of the Royal Hampshire County in Winchester, Hants, to meet medical requirements for the installation of a microchip.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also transforms the locks of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip. One lock treatment costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both at home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he lands his hand on the steering wheel.
The white house exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last decision of the White House to fly the helicopter of the Marines to the southern grassland of the White House to the American production event came to pay the taxpayers $24,000. The information is shown in the military documents received by the TIME magazine.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on his way. It was a vetoline at an event held in the White House on 17 July 2017, which presented American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials have been acquainted with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the samples included a sailing boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House's military office had requested a helicopter on a missionary order only about 36 hours before it landed to the southern lawnfield for an extraordinary event. This is reflected in the HMX-1 helicopter ship documents.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this, because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an email the day before the event to his supervisor, who is the Assistant Commander of the Marine Flight.
The message told us that the helicopter would arrive on 17 July at seven in the morning and the event would begin at three afternoons. The helicopter would not leave the site until the lawnfield was emptyed in the evening between six and nine.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter was to delay the departure from the White House, another crew would be required because of limitations in service time.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the security staff of the unit were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME whether there was ultimately a need for another crew.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was the Hatch Act, and we were told that it wasn't a crime," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the Deputy Commander answered.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the time, the President spoke in favour of the health reform which was being discussed by the Senate and a more delicate state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them on their journeys,
but their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the president’s campaign event in Melbourness, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of its predecessor’s presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products from all 50 states produced by American workers," said Lindsay Walters, the White House Press Secretary.
The HMX-1 unit's crew regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice the introduction of the President to the White House on a southern lawnfield with a precision of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 workouts for the White House.
According to one official, the flights to the Made in America event were part of the monthly training quota of the crew.
On that day, 11 hours of "non-presidential support" were also carried on the helicopters of the unit.
According to the White House, there were no other costs for the taxpayers.
Sikorsky's reporter told me that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation on the southern grassfield of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have any accounting for flights related to presidential tasks and it is difficult to assess the exact cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defense's 2017 hourly allowance, the level of compensation for VH-3D helicopters is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico base from Virginia state to White House and back lasted a total hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using the helicopter is significantly lower.
"It is misleading to calculate the costs for taxpayers according to the level of compensation," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called sinked costs, which are taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to the RAND research company’s 2015 report, compensation levels do not include staff costs but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, the former press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to present American production," Spicer said.
"I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is absolutely appropriate to bring it forward."
It's not sure if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat at the fire truck driver's place.
In the White House, Trump was joking to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
Lightning hit the Vasan track. Trains have to be replaced by buses.
Passenger train traffic between the Wall River and Vasa is crossed due to technical defects, reports the Road Transport Centre.
To date, trains are replaced by buses.
The defect of the traffic control system caused an old man.
The road transport centre did not have an estimate of the duration of the repair until morning.
The Venezuelan Attorney-General calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative
The Venezuelan Public Prosecutor has applied for a court order which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the delegation elected last Sunday will be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a representative of the country was elected, which could, among other things, change the Constitution of the country.
According to Attorney General Luisa Ortega, a decision on the prevention has been requested on grounds of suspicion of election.
Mr Ortega has also started a polling investigation.
He appointed two judges after the British company organised by the representative vote told me that the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was approximately a million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were eligible for the membership of the representative, and the 545 member of the elected representative was the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the representative can dismantle the Congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition believes that the drafting of the Constitution is a means of strengthening Maduro's position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduru and called it a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have indicated that they do not recognize a new representative.
Mr Maduro claims that the new representative is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, unrest has persisted for months.
They've been wounded by many people and more than 100 people have died.
Venezuela fell into the economic crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now, many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show its views on Friday, when a new representative is expected to start.
The Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to prison for 4 years in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis Court in the United States sentenced Maksim Senah, a 41-year-old, for about four years of imprisonment for involvement in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US requirement.
According to the Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland handed over to the US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian objections, reports the news office AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer cheating that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah got 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the sentence has been made.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized Finland hardly after the arrest and said that he should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing it in advance.
According to the Attorney, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which attacked tens of thousands of computers all over the world.
The virus was used to fish user names and passwords.
Subsequently, the frauders used information by continuing to control Internet traffic, making click frauds and spreading trash mail.
According to the former Director of the Ministry of Justice, Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing cyber criminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told in the press release.

Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is away from the images, so Cali cartel will rise to the main part of the Netflix hit series
Although the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed during the second production period of Narcos, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The radio service has already confirmed that the series will be seen in the third and fourth production period. The third-period trailer has been published and presents the new pigs of the series.
In the third production period, the US drug police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trading organisation.
Four co-chaired organisations operate "like Fortune 500" except that there is a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rap nitrogen) operates in New York.
In the recently published trailer Pedro Pascal returns Javier Peñana, who recruits US and Colombian police officers for a drug war.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production period of Narcos begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional artwork in Paris
The Joensuan light artist Kari Kola (in the dawn) will carry out an exceptional lighting work for the first day of the light set by the United Nations in Paris next May 16th.
Kola is making a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness day and night sun and moon.
The building is illustrated by the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe Monumente in front of it.
In my work, I would like to stress not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, the lighting of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my skills, I can bring things that I have experienced to be concretely visible, says the artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased with the invitation to be involved in the first International Day of Light and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Light Year in 2015, when she celebrated the celebration of the UNESCO headquarters.
I feel very privileged to have my art re-implemented to UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may still be expanding significantly.
This is what we will inform later in the coming autumn, Kola will continue.
The objective of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for humankind and to raise human awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The First Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fought at the shopping centre in the parking lot in Espoo
Two men were born to a dispute in Espoo in the store centre in the Grand Omena parking lot on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute was initiated when the other party accidentally drove in a banned direction.
There was an oral dispute between the drivers.
The driver who had driven in the banned direction would shout the driver of another car, resulting in this car moving into the crashing hiter.
After this, he hit the plane of the car.
In the preliminary speech, the man has admitted that he has caused damage and has done wrong.
Timo Soin wrote with a question mark: "Then the flood came"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (v.) published a blog writing on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The letter is short, only in two sentences.
During my time, the party grew from zero to the government of thirty-seven MEPs.
Then came the Flood, now everything is floating, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to France in the 1700s.
It is known that King Ludvig XV or Madame de Pompadour of this lover used the Flood Comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, history has left the statements "the Flood after us" or "the Flood after me".
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are representative only if they allow all the members of society, including women, to vote on Wednesday, said the leader of the UN Afghanistan Embassy.
Mr Haysom, the Interim Director of the United Nations Embassy of Assistance, said that there are hundreds of women at the county council elections, three women strive to become Vice-President and more than 30% of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be stressed too much," Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The provincial and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5.4.2017.
The Taliban has posed threats to elections at the same time as the international forces are moving to a consultative role.
This year's elections are the first time that the power moves peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution to strengthening Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Independent Electoral Board of Afghanistan, there are 1.2 million women of the 3.6 million registered voters.

In the capital region, the weather is rainy and rather windy.
In the afternoon, the cloud cover is shaking, and it can develop buckets.
It's clearer and clearer tonight.
In the south and the middle of the country, abundant rainfall can occur in the south.
In the south tonight, there is a southwest wind and clearer, some rainfall can still come.
The afternoon temperature in the rain is about fifteen, on the southwest coast after the more uniform rain has ceased near 20 degrees.
In the north clouds vary and become local afternoon drills.
During Fridays and Saturdays, low pressure controls the weather in the southern and middle part of the country, and rains are common.
In the north, the rain remains low.
On Saturday, in the southern and middle part of the country there are rains in many places, including the old man.
The rain also extends in part of Kainuu.
In the north clouds are abundant in the afternoon, and they will become individual rainbows.
The south coast winds from the south, in the middle and north of the country air flow is eastward.
There is a strong low pressure on the northeast of the British islands, which is associated with the rainfall in the south of Fennoskandia.

The flood of certain types of tourists threat to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly concerned with the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: it is only a few hours in place and it runs through attractions in large groups.
It is a short day trip to Venice for tourists to the city.
The narrow streets are hard to move and the nice squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be included.
They have been forced to move more and more away from the historical centre while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities consider restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the present phenomenon poor-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When a large cruise ship arrives, the time is given for two or three hours.
You will follow a guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialton Bridge and the St. Mark's Square, and you will return, describes Italian Minister for Culture, Dario Franceschini, the current and problem-provoking touristism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the identity of cities.
The St. Mark’s market is also one of the most popular destinations in Venice’s historic centre.
The church of St. Mark is located on the side of the tower.
Local anger is also mainly concerned with cruise ships.
In the historic centre of Venice, there are more than 50,000 locals.
In 1951 there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetian people showed their views against massaturism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives people away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years, there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe who organised the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because ships bring to Venice the necessary income and create a need for a wide range of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been envisaged that cruisers should go further from the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the Veneto administrative area, where Venice is also located, would have more power to decide on its own matters unless it is fully autonomous.
Every year, around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Crashes on the motorway of bad kilometers
On the motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siil, the road to the north has been driven from work on Thursday afternoon at the time of return traffic.
The area is covered by motorways, which slows traffic down, says Savon Sanomat.
There is an hourly limit of 50 km on the roads instead of the normal 120 km on the road.
However, even in the 50-kilometre limit area, on Thursday afternoon traffic had progressed in practical walking speeds.
On Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siil, the road works progressed with the Statue of Revelation, or with the golden hay.
I'll be fine without such attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures of himself, among other things, in the Grand Canyon landscape.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen as a recommended athlete in her current home country in Norway, not least because in March she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run by running at the time of the race.
A month later, he healed the 400 - metre rehearsal at the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Shortly after his record, Iuel, who used the social media, found that the famous and public have its shadow side.
Men around the world began to send Iuel pictures of their sex organs, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "crap pictures" from unknown people, so I had to change my account privately, Iuel told the VG magazine.
Iuel didn't want to figure out exactly what kind of pictures he got in the VG interview.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll be fine without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when she was 2 years old.
When Amalia was 12 years old, his father moved to Namibia first because of his work, then to Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were on their turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015 he switched Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Sletum.
Norway is much more open to discuss than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds records of Norway at 400 meters and 400 meters.
The snowwriter Janne Korve took his whole career to the risk of the MM races now: "Good to not hurt anything."
Now it's been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31 of Finland’s most successful snowshoeers, has been able to enjoy his beloved species again.
Last summer, the career was still under threat.
In January, the stress wound of the table had forced the ear to the surgery table, and the foot did not want to heal.
The hand had also taken a hit in the circuit.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether the board would continue or not.
The sponsors were broken and many things open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, it's the way things are going.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to retreat into the chest.
The subsequent decision was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was gonna fuck up, yeah, this is so funny again, we're gonna pull a couple more.
The corp was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long billing break, only a painless exercise has been a big thing.
The races of the Korpi have only been round a few.
It's okay.
The wishes have never been the most important aspect of the boarding for the ear.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to target four years for one race, and then you're in fever that week.
I don't think that's what Korpi says.
Today, the Korpi races at the semi-species of the Spanish World Championships in Sierra Nevada.
Although individual races do not hold him on board, he is always igniting for hard races.
According to the ear, the appreciation of the races organised by the International Ski Association has increased over the past few years, although some of the boarders chose the same time Norway's X-Games.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the conditions and level of competitions.
In Sierra Nevada, Korpi is the oldest athlete of the 12-person team in Finland.
The gaps of the team, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpe.
It's nice to follow the way younger friends go.
I remember when it was at the point that everything was new and so sick of everything.
It also brings new power to itself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still on the line somehow, but I'm not, that's what it's like in friends!
In the background of the boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The director's legend Pekka Korve's son is hooked up with nutritional sports: the boarder has his own nutritional horses for whom he does training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, it doesn't make any more time to be at the fair.
But every day I look at least the nutrients and usually some departures, Korpi says.
Ravint management and nutritional training are, according to the ear, a potential career plan when the boarding career will be completed in time.
I'm not planning that far, but it's at least a probable option.
I feel it like I'm studying it in the middle of the snowstorm.
I'm trying to stay nervous and develop, in the summer maybe drive some departures.
If it's my future profession, it's not hard to start when you're ready in the species.
The food business includes Elitloppet raviration with Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twin has rented a cruise ship that will run to the Elitloppet River competition in Stockholm at the end of May.
The Korpi and the Castle land decided to resurrect the old tradition.
Crossing has become a very good deal, and people have been excited.
Now we're already at the point that at least there's no bankruptcy.
A few months left, we hope we'll get the ship full, Korpi says he's excited.
Attendo's home project for Kitee has surprised everything
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-place home for caregivers to build for Kitee.
A building of more than 1,700 floors will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre.
The general subject of the question is what the new care unit has to offer customers, because during the wars of Siu many private care homes are facing customer shortages.
The Regional Manager of Nursing Services Anne Flink Attendo commented that Kite will have more demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice also works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought private care homes from Kite last year in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The deal concerned business, but the real estate has to be rented for five years.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move functions out of these premises.
More on this issue later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand at the Scottish factory
The trade union seeks to strengthen the long-term commitment of McVitie's chef to production at Glasgow's factory.
According to the Department of the United Kingdom General Trade Union of the GMB in Scotland, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekses and other products have more than 500 employees.
The McVitie's brand-owned Pladis company reported that it has invested more than five million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives are "in fact the first to be compiled" if changes are taking place.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to "response the concern that no funding has been allocated to modernising production lines".
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned about the fact that the factory manager does not get any clear information on the business needs of Tollcross and the future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the labour force has focused heavily on the local community and the Glasgow city area. The factory is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, as well as Brexit, rising cost of living and continuous reductions in production, East Glasgow really needs successful McVitie's production."
According to the Pladis reporter, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter on the previous day and the company responded directly because it appreciated the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and unsafe companies on the market, we continuously evaluate all of our business activities and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the report, in recent years, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross factory, in particular in its production lines and the improvement of its operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production plant and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up on Neymar's quest after paying for the termination of the transfer amount of GBP 189 million. But did PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked-out of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfers. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer of GBP 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's most earned professional athlete, as PSG will offer him a weekly salary of more than £500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be annoyed by PSG’s activities and the way Neymar has left the company. The source close to Barcelona tells us that the company has been very well cared for Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did PSG's president warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they look for our players, we will become their opponents and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're looking for our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed its interest in PSG's central field player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italians to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona therefore loses its star player Neymar.

Now, the phone calls that Trump was filing were invented by the White House reporter, "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, says the New York Times.
The phone calls from Trump with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the patrol organization have proved to be invented.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House reporter, confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said that Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto, President of Mexico, had discussed Trump at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty hard charge.
These discussions took place, not only on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified.
The speech to the patrols raised an atrocity
On Monday, Trump told us that the President of Mexico called him, and that he was disgusted by Trump's successful illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few more come across the southern border of Mexico, because they know the journey anyway to the border of the United States.
On Wednesday, the Government of Mexico published a press release stating that this call has not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published the perfect version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That was where Trump shook his speech at a large meeting of the National Patrol Organisation in Western Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the patrols, he said it was the finest speech that has ever been held to them.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the patrol organization informed that it was not aware of the call of any of its directors to Trump.
According to the information, the previous statement by Michael Surbaugh, director of the organization, who had asked Trump to apologize for his speech, speaks himself to his side.
Trumpi's speech at the meeting of the patrol organisation was a lot of odds, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He blew the results of the presidential elections last autumn.
