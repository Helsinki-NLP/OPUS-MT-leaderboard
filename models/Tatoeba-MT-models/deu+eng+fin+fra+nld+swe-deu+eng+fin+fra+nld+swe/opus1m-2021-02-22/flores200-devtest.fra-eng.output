This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already very widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and tridimensional disposition.
Scientists say that the feather of this animal was châtain brown on the top and pale or carotenoid color on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is known as rachis, but show other characteristics of the feathers – barbers and barbers – the researchers have concluded that rachis is probably a evolutionary development after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the queue of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather rather than the dust of a chicken.
The scientists state that this is the queue of a young dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, not a young person.

The weapon of Uka was stuck while it was pointed on the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from a sparkling pain, sees no more than one eye, lost part of his skull, and his face was rebuilt from titanium.
Schneider witnessed by video linking from a USAF base in his country.
Apart from the Wednesday event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the Championships.
She first participated in the slalom, where she obtained a "do not finish" (DNF) during her first race. 36 of 116 competitors obtained the same result in this race.
His second race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish the tenth place of the group of seated women with a combined time of 4:41.30, or 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first arrival, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, ninth arrival.
In the category of women sitting skiing, four skiers were unable to complete their course; with regard to the giant slalom, 45 of the total 117 skiers in this race failed to rank themselves.
Madhya Pradesh police found the mobile computer and the stolen mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we recovered his phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, said that the accused had the face hidden when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The route on which the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court Court.
She is in custody waiting for her examination and trial, but eyewitnesses could be compromised because her portrait was widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "the journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Office of the Crown Prosecutor, who is in charge of all prosecutions, informed the journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leakage, the document will address the dispute at the border that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics included the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred for both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents for a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite control test had to be closely monitored by liners, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who is an actor responsible for the conservation of the park and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly introduced yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dissolution of the previous EPC as part of a set of measures to engage the country in the process of new elections.
This committee was Martelly's response to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which had to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed him of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The department responded by qualifiing it as "very regrettable" to delay Apple's report.
The earthquake hit the Marians at 7.19 p.m. local time (21.19 GMT Friday).
The North Marianne Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre stated that there were no signs of tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took hostage from Hong Kong tourists by turning their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 gun.
Several hostages have been saved, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and older people, were released prematurely, as were the Philippines photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed his father's tracks and started a doctor's career.
He was trained as obsessors and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time.
Its research has shown that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the baby’s pulmonary maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or black boxes) on Wednesday.
The other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. A unique moment, like she. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and she will miss me... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into the Republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a Republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of respondents share this view, and wish Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 per cent of respondents think Australia should become a Republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent think Australia should never become a Republic.
The Olympic gold medal was to swim at 100 m and 200 m of free swimming and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to its complaints, its physical condition was doubted.
He could not take the medications necessary to overcome his pain, these being prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number of first known to date on January 25.
Several people checked the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, since comets came into collision with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his Governor's term at the beginning of this year and signed a bill on the marriage of persons of the same sex last month.
He described rumors as "political foolishness."
We think he will be presenting himself to the Presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that allows devices to fly on shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel every year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on ground radar systems previously used, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is not available and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport has given rise to the possibility that the game can be played in closed home, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the Science magazine reported the genesis of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated much longer, following the reproduction between a Darwin endemic pinson, Geospiza fortis, and the Conic Bec immigrant pinson, Geospiza conirostris.
We can shape the gold in many ways. It can be rolled in small pieces
It can be drawn in fine wire, which can be twisted and twisted. It can be tortured or rolled in leaves.
It can be made very fin, and collated on another metal. It may be so fin that it has sometimes been used to decorate pictures painted with the hand in books called "lit manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Chocolate juice changes colour depending on acidity or basicity (alcalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been demolitioned from their electron (because hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with water hunting in almost all houses, connected with a sophisticated sewage system.
Rests of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minonean cities of Crete and Santorin in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, in Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women were sideways.
When you call a person that is thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and returns it to Earth, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the earthly atmosphere deforms part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket of more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is to make transport much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are more medium sized felains that also eat medium size prey, ranging from rabbits to antilopes and other hips.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) who eat the small prey, many more, such as insects, nuggets, lobsters and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task devoted to each feminine, preventing him from competing with others.
Lions are the most societal cats living in large groups called predators.
The predators are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as thirty females and lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, with their family consisting of a large number of sisters and girls.
Lions' troops act like wolves or dogs, astonishingly similar to lions (but not to other great felains) in their behaviour, and also very mortal for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes hard), swim, jump from great distances and pull five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genre Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felains are the only ones who are able to roast.
The worthiness of the tiger does not look like the worthiness of the lion, but rather as a phrase whose words would be screaming and grounding.
The ocelots are sprinkled with small animals. They catch monkeys, serpents, rongers and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunt are much smaller than he.
According to the scientists, ocelots track and find the animals to eat (prows) through the smell, sniffing their journey on the ground.
They see very well in darkness thanks to their night vision, and also move very furiously. Ocelots track their prey by melting into their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population of which it is derived (for example, if it moves above a mountain chain or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adjustments.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will seem so different that they cannot be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "specification", which simply means the formation of new species. Specification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans extract (i.e., they expire).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shadow.
We manufacture our houses and our plant-based clothing. Most foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosaic was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other Mosaic.
His long coughs were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like shaving blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palace, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the tongue folded. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasars, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything in the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not sized against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual festivities, including birds, pawns, squirrels, and the lobster, some kind of gnager.
Another difference: While the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, rich men liked to organize banquets together where they were resting on the side while eating their meals.
The ancient Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Romans have ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of God.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggourates, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the stores were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built in stones.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan land, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is reported that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and so called it — while travelling more west.
But regardless of his discovery, esquimaude tribes lived there already at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the Benjamin Gates film and the Templiers Treasure, you may think that a treasure card has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776" could be read.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchemine (which measures about 29 inches three quarters over 24 inches) was rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating has been added simply as a label.
The landing of day J and the following battles released northern France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by the French of Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupyer instead of confronting him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had released the south of France and went to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work together, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and which is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means great city or city-state, and which in some way also indicates the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-States are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on it to the State authorities, often not cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the power to derogate from tax laws or customs laws between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian National Football Team is, together with the German National Team, the second most qualified team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, escrime, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to its group of islands, Japan is often designated from a geographical point of view as a "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European browsers passing over there mentioned it as Ilha Formosa, or "a beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous crop production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of Qing dynastia (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it Province of Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the first Sino-Japanese war (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it surrendered Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then led the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the adjacent buildings of the complex have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better overview of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continued until today.
For example, the world's most common photographic format is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the photographic sensor of digital cameras.
The size 35 mm is actually, and it is rather disconcerting, 36 mm wide at 24 mm height.
It is thus said that the aspect report of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of the whole number reports) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are similar to or close to this aspect report.
The rule of third parties, highly mistreated and often turned into ridiculous, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines splitting the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christian religion has linked European states with each other despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the rotor.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the money funds of the church are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, the United Kingdom established a ship blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom is an international water in order to prevent ships from exploring in whole maritime areas, thus presenting a threat to neutral vessels.
As this tactic only caused a shy reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its underwater war without limits.
During the 20th century, most citizens and nations were stimulating for peace and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (her director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way to show the different times; every step in China or family that was in power was a distinct dynastie.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the period of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in the history of the ancient Chinese. Thousands of people died in the battle to sit on the throne of the Great Palace of XI's.
There are many social and political implications such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one leader.
Therefore, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the ranking of the army is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other working classes repressed from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that exceeded the framework of this mouthly life. He used to visit a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very lively image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of La Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists, and when you entered the cave, you're completely isolated.
On top of it, there is nothing other than the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear only very few things from this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium before C.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures built in honour of the deceased pharaons.
The plateau of Gizeh, or "Gizeh Necropolis", in the Death Valley in Egypt, combines several pyramids (the great pyramid is the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaon of Cheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his women as well as the members of his family.
The "drive" symbol looks like a V and the "draw" symbol is like a stick or square whose lower side is missing.
The top means that you must start with the tip and push the arch, and the bottom means that you must start with the rise (which is the place where your hand holds the arch) and pull the arch.
An archet to the top usually produces a softer sound, while an archet to the bottom is stronger and stronger.
Do not hesitate to register your own marks in the pencil, but do not forget that the printed marks are for a musical motif, and therefore generally they must be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the king, Mrs Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors.
In a carross, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their bodies.
At some time, a member of the crowd burned the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war spending of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenditures and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippines government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templiers, we need to understand the context that has led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages – period of history in current Europe from the XIth to the XIIIth century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological imperfection to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process that largely exceeds cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically conditioned societies rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that cars necessarily lead to road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques to cure body injury.
Romance was an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romantism, geography would have formed individuals and, with time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury spice began in the area of the year 400, and lasted up to about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because of the fact that the Croissants were responsible for presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the capital title of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style experienced its apocalypse between the 19th and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could cause a delay of 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the cruises, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Liver farming is a farming practice that produces enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Liver farming is a simple, often biological system using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers used livelihood farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by social standards and share the same ideas that allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
Criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, manierisms and shrimp.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to inspire a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, unfortunateness or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered to be "feroces" or wild; some wild children have been locked up by individuals (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuses or traumas before being abandoned or escaped.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When they are fully raised by non-human species, wild children have behaviours (without their physical provisions) almost identical to those of the animals who raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but more a way to help learners who discover new teachings such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
The support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the small trombone man from Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual work is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for very different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, through extortion.
No child should ever have to grow in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We see the family placement system as a security zone for these children.
Our foster family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The host family placement is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were previously withdrawn.
The Internet combines mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaching uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the Speech because of brain injury are nevertheless able to evaluate sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such ability to interpret human behaviour can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reservation of the changes expressed.
Segregation and recombination alter the variations between the two basins to each generation.
In the savane, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy its needs of amino acids from available plant resources.
In addition, lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (fournished, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
Well considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" a little in the same way as the savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process that involves intentional awakening during your sleeping period and swelling shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet awakening, in order to regain your consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you find yourself to reset the watch during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorythm include drinking a lot of liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known as diuretics), which makes you wake up to urine.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The weaker the tension, the more vital force present is positive. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach illumination. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativeness.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga attitudes, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real confrontations, through alternative army, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
But these plans became almost obsolete from day to day, when more than 800 000 Soviet Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after entering the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is far from the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods through the oceans.
Marines' work has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move its people and property.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring the Atlantic Ocean through soldiers and equipment to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-Boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats have been housed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Old crops and tribes have begun to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
The domestic goats were usually kept in the flocks that would fall on the hills or other pasture areas, often nursed by peasants who were most of the time children or adolescents, similar to the more known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been used today.
The "wagonways" were built in England from the sixteenth century.
Although the trails for wagons were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses who pulled them to reach higher speeds and to draw more loads than on the slightly more accidental roads of the day.
The crossroads were introduced early enough to maintain the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were equipped with a iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first way of locomotion was to walk: humans began to walk up two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the australopithes, did not walk as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus has been able to walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, joining the environmental movement, and we can even militate to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed much thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a manuscript project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets from there, to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Court of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontoologists today think that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them as dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there's a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the handling of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to prevent immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic domestic medicines or chemicals.
See the label to find out about the first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term deriving from an old familiarity with bed punaises, which are very suitable insects to parasite humans.
Reducers, as well as bed punches, are nestling, i.e. suitable for living in the nest or habitat of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (SEP), making it the main neurological disease in young and medium-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of brain, spinal cord and optical nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple can very well believe that it is not in their interest, nor in the interests of the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents cease their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main aim of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most of the scientific research.
However, this is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible assumptions, ask questions and make observations, but also oriented scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline in the knowledge of Greek, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological watches.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimulations, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, mushrooms, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experience was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to mark either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material and if the affected cells are germinal cells.
Only germinal cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is interested in people wishing to visit natural areas with a view to enjoying the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation, park visit and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can see, photograph and discover Borneo's orang-outans.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns by car to go to their place of work and meet other people who are going to work in the country that they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, each is in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dismantled the biosphere of its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Quite everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonablely consistent range; so, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximately.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to steal made it easier to escape from their enemies and to find more effective food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of rehearsing their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot refold their wings are dragons and ephemers.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarque said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the broadest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
Not less than 20 per cent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from Amazon.
The Amazon River's main arm is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Gizeh have never been exceeded by their size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, who then were much more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City writes its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of every day used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are in the raw form of nature and are quite easy to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was the earth, the water, the air and the fire.
Rather, these were the four states of the matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also issued the theory that the latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, are also found.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All the matter is made of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incrediblely small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new editorial methods has left the pen to a more confidential status and to more rare uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a crayon size.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will be when the next new one will arrive.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a core of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A little as if we had a hill grabbed with a heavy chariot. By splitting the kernel again, then liberating a little of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable core, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the close side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to go back to the surface.
Content theories are focused on searching for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature to adult age.
These theories examine what drives some people to want things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the theory of the hierarchy of the needs of Maslow and the theory of the two factors of Herzberg.
In general, two behaviours may arise when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. One of the ends of the spectrum being trying to stay "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and keeping others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group created so far and do things in his way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often results in differences between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often serve as the contact point of their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet on the basis of different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real " invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to make the fast process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the client.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition study, thus reducing the research field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It is known for a long time that various types of damage, injury, tumors and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies enables us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and equipment to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly known as science-fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer science that studyes the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is to automate tasks machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to separate disciplines, focusing on the delivery of solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The IA system is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been designed in several domestic computer and video games software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Many times, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outputs. Students can look at the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb artwork while staying sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to think about a trip and share its experiences with future generations.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Bloggers can also help students improve their editorial skills. Although students often try blog experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having a public tends to change the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "obligates students to better know the world around them." The need to raise public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
"When it is used properly, blogs "may enable students to strengthen their analytical capabilities and critical mind: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their opinion with the opinion of others and present their own views on specific topics" (Orwith, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
You will find more south the Niagara Falls and north, the region of Muskoka and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many others, do Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas more north are quite few and some are almost inhabited in wilderness.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, on the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is far from the largest country, and even a continent on its own, with regard to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam in the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Town Road linking Europe to India.
In the north, the region is delimited by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended for any woman traveling to say that she is married, regardless of her civil status.
It is also advisable to carry an alliance (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences may lead to behaviours that they consider to be harassment, as it is common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in the rejection of men's advances, and don't be afraid to keep good (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 19th century BC, and was used by Phenicians, Romans and Mérinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt and baptized Casa Branca after destroying it, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trade counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to make purchases.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, pottery, margarine articles, narcilles and bibelots of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that enveli most of the streets of the city, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma needs to be investigated to understand the status of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for the catching gorillas of the mountains among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to move in Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Tomboctou" has become a metaphor for remote and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border of Mozambique east, from Zimbabwe to north and the south border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, it is divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific wildlife.
This is one of the most famous attraction parks in South Africa and is considered the flower of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation rights for the park.
It can be beneficial to obtain a Wild Card that provides access to certain South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name in the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings drawing the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared with a glittering bar chart, which appears by reflection in the waters of the port of Victoria.
To admire Hong Kong's most beautiful panoramas, leave the island and join the Kowloon seafront opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is concentrated on the northern shoreland.
This is the place that British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangroves belt in the world, stretching over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, are not merely made up of mangrove marshs: they also contain some of the last remnants of majestic jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately one third is covered by water/mareage areas.
Sundarbans has been a natural reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 tigers of the Royal Bengal and 30,000 sliced cereals.
The buses leave the Interdistrict bus station (situated on the other shore) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboers, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock is a hauban bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise at a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two paths of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical decomposition under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only open to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs control posts should be completed.
The Guaranís were the largest native population, which is now east of Paraguay, living as semi-nomad hunters and also exercising livelihood farming.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting or harvesting.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, formerly called "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the Asunción Foundation in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in maintaining a large proportion of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo terrains of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places where to buy tickets for polo games, visit the Association Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Maluines Islands is the book of the Maluines Islands (FKP) with a value equivalent to a British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the sole bank of the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The UK Pound is a commonly accepted currency across the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if British and American currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Malouins outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo being located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical area and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really rainy and dry seasons: precipitation is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are wild species; please don't feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wild animals!
As hard as they can look, the bison, the elan, the orignal, the bear and almost all the big animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, know that smells attract the bears and other wild animals, then avoid transporting or cooking fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly famous marine impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were cast, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was murdered at a peaceful assembly held in town during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Nearly all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe bathing, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the center of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very visited by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink water from the local robinet safely, but you can easily find water in bottles if you have fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "caffeine cream" is foreign. A short black is a "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in accordance with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many reef trips are carried out throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all panels and pay particular attention to security warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the meduses-boxes arrive near the beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
The sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of human beings and would escape from them.
Salt water crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The reservation in advance gives the traveller the tranquility of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrived at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport service from/to the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or provide you with other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any change or request must, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well placed campsite area.
Don't forget that even if the music shows are finished on the main scenes, other music shows can continue until late in the night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the crossing of the ice can cause unsustainable noises at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers of cruises are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and watches, and outputs may be difficult to detect.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment to maintain the right atmosphere for guests and to keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, ivory alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who travels by car at high latitudes or crosses mountain collars must consider the possibility of snow, ice or ice temperatures.
On the iced and snowy roads, the frottedness is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on the naked asphalt.
During the bubbles, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powdering, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari may be the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important time for many visitors.
In the common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, especially in the savanna, with the purpose of attending the show of wild animals in their midst.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close to cars, and standard equipment allows them to be observed well.
Lions, gepards and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with twins.
A foot safari (also known as "walking in brush", "pedestrian safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the notice of the delay, you may be faced with a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
Most of the event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yens, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yens.
By ironing wet clothes, you can make them dry more easily. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there is no in the rooms.
If you do not have iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid not to leave the tissue overheated (which can cause it to be narrowed or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different water purification methods, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, just make the water boil for one minute; in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a renowned company.

The bars are support for the feet of the rider, which hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: in fact, the user's feet can stay stuck there.
If a horse rider is projected from a horse, but has a foot taken into it, it could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear horseback boots with a heel and a smooth and pretty narrow soda.
Then, some seams, including English, have safety bars that allow a rod to fall from the seam if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
