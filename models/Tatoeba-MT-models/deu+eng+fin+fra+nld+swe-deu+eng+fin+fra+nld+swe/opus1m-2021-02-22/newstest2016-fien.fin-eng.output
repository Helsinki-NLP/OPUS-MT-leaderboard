The 9-year-old boy who escaped from Tampere was found
The police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The report of disappearance of a boy who moved with his friend from West Tampere has been spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and he has no risk of life and health.
The father of the boy told the night-Sanoma when he knew that he was found.
He's okay, and now we're gonna start the ex-post.
The boy was found in the neighborhood, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, again, scratched the painting to the Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paints in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to work in the Masters league.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo from the champion's league was turned to the last advantage for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo alone moved to the top of the goalmaker statistics of all ages when he shot a visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of penalty shots and one of the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his balance to 80 when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess, who was playing a record, had 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been joining in the Italian Football League in Serie A since the beginning, but in the Masters League D, it started with a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winner was made over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city attack bored the absence of Sergei Aguero on the knee.
Aguero, who was injured at the weekend's election gaming game, came to the field only in the last 10 minutes.
The second company of Manchester United also experienced a severe loss of 1-2 against PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands.
Luke Shaw's 20-year-old teamman's visitor's fight only lasts a quarter.
Hector Moreno's dangerous sliding clause hit the paint towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke a riot leg.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of the Eindhoven home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to 1-0 in 41 minutes, but ManU's joy only took a few minutes.
Moreno was up to the rest of the time before the break.
Luciano Narsingh was the winner of PSV in the second half of the time.
The season of painting in the Champions League began in the A-site Paris Saint-Germain.
The case was replaced by the Argentine Angel Di Maria with the PSG shirt of Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball to the back of the ball past Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made PSG 2-0 for the second half of the time.
PSG has been betting among the successors of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, belonging to the league's small associations, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, PSG's star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, Tsjechia, lost in the B-B game in Germany at Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce. The president made the wrong speech.
The Zimbabwen President Robert Mugabe held the same speech that he had held a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has held the same speech in Parliament again that he held at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether Mugabe, 91, is in full spirit.
MDC called for Mugabe to quit his mission because this is too old to control.
Mugabe's assistants hurried to say that the confusion had just happened in the Mugabe board and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now about the Chinese impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council, will assess the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe could be more effectively registered.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, included in the internal ministerial table.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the emergency call
Just a little bit of a colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" is alive and probably shocked, both said that the contact details of the dead woman's neighbors can be found on this phone.
The police inside the house found Amy Prentiss's body and fiction's handwritten message: "I am so sorry I hope I can withdraw this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said the letter, which according to the experts is signed by Lambi.
Nothing pointed to the fact that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Minnesota Cleveland's Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school camp where the police believe he shot and killed the teacher of the past history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this working room.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told the university officials about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
He said Lambin called a fateful emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by another: Lamb committed suicide when the police were surrounded.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lambi's motive a day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lambi as a talented teacher, but possibly having problems.
Students told me they were waiting for him for hours.
The police of the Prentiss Death Place, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lambi in his book, in which he thanked "maybe people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambi, but said that he also seemed nervous and unrestful, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lambin told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave at Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctoral status, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
The University Director William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was no conflict, but that " clearly there was something in Lambi's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled from the campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 calibre gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of the house of his parents in the suburb of Mississipin Greenville, told Washington County Death Detective Methel Johnson.
Lambi's car was still on the steep road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started work at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The University has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb did a doctoral degree in education in spring.
One of Lambi’s old friends described him as intelligent, karismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through common friends.
Hairston and his friends were at high school, and Lamb was funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston to play guitar for many years.
He was a pretty charming man in those times.
All the girls were melting wax when he was there, now told Hairston, 40 years old, who lives in Jackson's suburb in Brandon.
Apparently Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was okay.
Prentiss' former husband, Shawn O'Steen, told them that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really shocked," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me that he had not met Lambi, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later they called together on some gigs.
O'Steen told me his daughter is doing and singing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different network companies.
The barman of the curious bar near Gautier, The Julep Room, and the time-consuming entertainment organiser Mike Shaffer, tells me that he saw Lambi and Prentiss last night in September 5th, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip-harp presentation to the harsh audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were joking and throwing buzzes to each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history," said school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was President of his brotherhood and student board.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, the Delta Staten campus held a candlestick with about 900 people, including teachers and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the fair during which the university choir sang songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report about Mississipin Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississipin Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police now say Lambin called an emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that even though Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less employees for vacation
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for vacations as last year, but the Toy and Baby products dealer says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to spend more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in business and distribution centres across the country, compared to 45,000 employees during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said that the interviews of applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of vacation, the Christmas period is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the occupation of shops and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana
The first night of the movie's return to the future was a professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat at the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that I sat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana was next to me," she said the coming documentary film Back in Time's trailer.
The movie starts and I think I'm just a puppy and a hand-drift from a date with the princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary from the film Return to the Future interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future got its first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "To me it is undoubtedly the finest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be solved weaponously.
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict is "no armed solution", and additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader reiterated its call on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Ban told us that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the General Assembly at the ministerial week of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France - later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the fragmentation of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis in dealing with solidarity and unanimity as they showed in the agreement on the Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support results that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to stamp him as a windmill.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some people are waiting for a crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to dismantle Donald Trumpi from the top of the support panels, it has not been successful (also).
Of the last 11 national surveys in the ten, Donald Trump has been in the lead in a two-digit chapter, and some have started seriously to think about what this means, even with regard to the possibility of appointing the property.
Of course, the election period is only at the beginning.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators note that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its leadership to the upcoming Herman Cain, neither of whom received a state in the appointing process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organisation Club for Growth, have noticed Trump's persistence and started to use his funds to destroy him.
The following recent support results indicate that the property king is not only a transient phase:
Trump's popular numbers have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced that he was a candidate in mid-June, Monmouth University's support reports showed that only two of the ten Republicans were positive about the property case.
By mid-July the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six of the ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they're negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
Last week, 60 per cent of the Republicans, in the support survey conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa, reported that they welcomed Trump.
Two thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of the Republicans said that they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfactory" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two of the ten said they would be "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson is able to achieve the highest level of enthusiasm that Trump (43 per cent "enthusiasts" vs. 40 per cent Trump).
Next most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican voters would be "unhappy" or "abated" if Jeb Bush became a candidate for the rulers' favorites.
The fiery nature of Trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his powerful speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post question on Monday, 52 percent of the voters who are on the republican side at national level think that the property community has a suitable quality for the president.
According to Quinnipiac's survey last week, the figure in the Iowa State of First Party Meeting is the same: 52 per cent of the Republicans think Trump has the right quality for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Posti survey, 44 per cent thinks that his character is not suitable for acting as President, and nearly six out of ten thinks that his character is not part of the White House.
The Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When the Republican voters think like the commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four of the ten considered Trumpi to be the most likely option when asking who is most likely to be appointed as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Publication of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest crystal ball possible.
During the last parliamentary period at this time, four of the ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry would be appointed as a candidate, and only 28 per cent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the Republican voters consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Even though the Republicans would be in favour of another candidate, Trump would still win almost every one.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in the hypothetical bilateral competition between Trump and almost all other Republican Candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points.
He's on the right track with Ted Cruz.
The only winning candidate for Trump?
If they were put on the other side, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump's great difference of 18 points.
Just and just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters in Trumpi have decided to vote.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure that they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they could possibly change a candidate.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurochirurg Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six of the ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants " rapers" in his campaign launch speech, immigration has been in the middle of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's power effort will drive Latin voters further away from the Republican party and harm rebranding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six of the ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is in the middle of things, there is also Donald Trump.
The frustration of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six of the ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post question on Monday that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey on Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa have been frustrated by the Republicans in the Congress: 54 per cent are "unhappy" and 21 per cent "very angry".
First attendance of Jeremy Corbyn at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first attendance at the interrogation hour has been eagerly awaited since his choice.
The new Labour Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corby, meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby will rise to ask about his first six questions a little after midday, and probably both the media and the Labour Party's representatives will closely monitor his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show "lesser theater and more facts".
He has also said that some of the opportunities could be left to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow administration and he spoke at the annual meeting of the trade union central organisation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour Party leader to stand silent during the national song in the Memorial Service of Tuesday, held on the 75th anniversary of the British Air War, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party’s people’s representatives and has appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said he was "respectfully quiet" and that he confessed "the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Corbyn's shadow government member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight program that he would have invited the Labour Party leader to sing a national song despite the fact that he thought the Royal Chamber should be discontinued.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's interior, calling for disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and initially under one sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as a leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the lines on the role of the party in the European Union and on the government's grant ceiling have also "agreed" within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Mr Corbyn said at the trade union central meeting that the Labour Party would make a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hourly later, the shadow government's work and pension secretary Smith said that the party was "very clear" about the fact that they only opposed government plans to lower the ceiling from GBP 26 000 to GBP 230,000.
Corbyn became the fifth leader of the Labour Party, whom David Cameron has met in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Head of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now tells the Prime Minister that he has "peopled" ideas for questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corby, MEP of the Islington North, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both clever wording and piecing, instead, to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequalities and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Government's Secretary for Economic Affairs, will be her replacement at the interrogatory hours when Corby is not attending - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the President of the Chamber, John Bercowi, from the teams.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theater that is often combined with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since the beginning of television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator for assessing the manager's discretion, the management of his sub-room, and his position with other people's representatives, although critics have criticised the question hours for their being just a flaw that requires far-reaching reforms.
Described in Joburg: Homeless youths are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street psychics has found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos from their neighbors and get a win from them.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

The value of the pound will rise as the wage growth in the UK accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers seemed to rise in the UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the SABMiller bidding destination.
Between May and July, British salaries, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to last year.
The growth rate was the fastest after 2009, and it was considered to bring estimates of the rise in rates.
The red rose to $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent to $1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index was closed by an increase of 1.49 % to read 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive market share and increased by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it by offering.
The agreement would combine two of the world's biggest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after a competitive luxury product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the miner told me that it had collected $2.5 billion by releasing shares as part of its debt cut strategy.
The package and paper group Mond’s shares were the largest calculators of the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs moved his recommendation from the company to the form of "sales".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports goods company published its six-year returns before taxes: 83 per cent increase to GBP 46.6 million.
According to the Director of JD Sports, higher salaries may harm enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is increased in the UK, it may mean "creating the purchasing power of potential consumers".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, says Cowgill.
The costs could be related to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash starts a grassroots campaign against intrusion in Aldi's field
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and West Austria.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Austria before Aldin attacked $700 million.
Aldi will prepare for the opening of two distribution centres and the first trade in South and Western Austria next year, with up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build IGA brands through the marketing of mainstream and social media, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA’s merchants and purchasers have jumped along, and brands such as Dunsborough’s ice cream manufacturer Simmo’s offer taste in IGA’s stores, and the owners of the stores sell discounted tickets for Australian football matches to their parent customers.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods organises an annual strategy day for investors.
There is a lot of money, as South and Western Austria make up almost 30% of the Metcash IGA area, and there are higher profit margins than the IGA network of the Eastern States of Metcash.
In South and West Australia, visitors are known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first movements.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA’s retailers can lose $ 360 million each year in sales and Metcash may lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 and 30 movements in the west, which will produce $500 and $600 million in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at the base of Metcash's high fixed costs can pay Metcash about $13 million in business profits before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan investigation found that IGA’s customers were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s sales of food and food will decrease by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, thereby reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the leading investment fund manager and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at the business lunch at Melbourne that Metcash can "be well possibly lost in the decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash government would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which delivers products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations in terms of pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler maintains half, and has invested more than $150 million each year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products every week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate stores by increasing the increase in fresh food and placing on the market a better selection of private brand products.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that the lowering of prices and the improvement of stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the way of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time for four years.
President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered side by side in a recent storm, which has rushed around his friend Nick Kyrgyos. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says the Australian tennis union president Steve Healy.
Mr. Kokkinakis, a talented twin called "Special Ks", was unwilling to become public in a case where Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrink in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after this, in a fiery cartel in Cincinnati, the head judge had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison from one another twice when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his battle after the cramp ruined his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis' unhappy defender.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth in two games with Bernard Tomici in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I'm pretty strong in the opinion that Thanasi has only been drawn into the whistle," Healy said.
He broke his streak when he lost his streak because of the cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his streak when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But she's been doing very well, even in quite provocative situations with Harrison at the US Open and so on, and I think she deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little hard.
He is very mature for the age of 19, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he practices firmly, is in good condition and is quite peaceful and mature young man, and I think he should be assessed according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgyzstan in the important games that start on Friday, and I describe this "common decision" as a good solution for all, but still support the Canberian return to the team's stable facility.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not on all polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and earned all his criticism. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of public thinking about these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of exception and closed its southern border against Serbia, preventing those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of draining the flow of migrants coming to the country.
The border followed chaos when hundreds of immigrants gathered into an impartial area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with a shock.
People who fled the violence of their home countries have now set up their tent and set up for an undefined time between two country inspection stations.
However, frustration increased.
When the police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police.
Some refused to protest about food and water.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that the return of immigrants from Hungary is "impossible" when they arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause damage to civilians.
The debate will have to be held with the other countries and Brussels in the next few days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion at the Hungarian-Serbia border was created after the 28 nationality group failed to establish a common immigration policy at a conflicting meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 asylum-seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they hoped that the final agreement would be reached - by next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
On Tuesday next week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an additional EU summit to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work in the near future.
Tuesday’s emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to respond to the crisis and enabled you to be closed and to speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, the Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the border with Serbia is ready, the country is also planning to set up a steak wire to a part of its border against Romania to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the steak wire line between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottlenecks and place of entry to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are a war in the escape from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for better lives and not those who are entitled to protection under war - this view is strongly in contradiction with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the undertaking to cross or damage the 4-metre (13 feet) sliced wire, built by the government at the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"In view of the situation caused by immigration, the Hungarian government declares an emergency," told journalists Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still needs to formally accept the position of the armed forces expected for next week, but Associated Press journalists at the border have seen heavy armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's home security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 more in the country.
They got over by hurting the fence, now being inmates of the police, and they are charged with the infringements laid down in new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings from the border against Serbia after sending a train car covered with a wire to close one of these locations.
The main border crossing site near the Hungarian Roszea was covered by chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for human handling and the crowds were trying to penetrate inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to the national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership Bernie Sanders has been reduced
The former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton will continue in two-digit leadership in the Democrats' Nomination Championship, but Senator Bernie Sanders will scratch him.
Clinton is now supporting 47 per cent of the democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), and the second is the support of 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet indicated whether he will join the president, but he is in favour of 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most democrats say that it is too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choices more stringent than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined in several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strong in the leadership of women and moderates, but his leadership has been reduced.
His popularity with men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five percentage points behind.
Clinton's frontier in the district of democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he is now on levels with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading with the parents' voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double number with the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratic voters say they will be eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15 per cent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in supporting him.
The minds are more confused with those who aren't in favour of Clinton at the moment... only one quarter of them would enthusiasticly support him.
Where 48 per cent of the democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the Republican first man Donald Trump says the same thing as a fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had an appropriate experience (16 per cent). Afterwards, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the women’s president (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate for the mission (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same views and the possibility of a complaint were also mentioned.
As the Vice President influences a possible presidential candidateship, 57 percent of the democratists would like to see him in the competition already, even though one third disagrees.
When asked the democrats who they would choose for the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the candidates for Democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow, and if Biden goes along, then the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, then the figure will be 30.
55% of the democrats believe Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voting-in-law has increased.
However, when the democrats were asked what was most important in the candidate, they raised their views before voting.
Even last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democrats' candidates or potential candidates are doing very well in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's best thing to do is to be honest, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30 per cent of the democrats say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they have no opinion on Sanders.
In general, the democratic voters also believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
Looking at all these points, about one quarter of the democrats say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server as Minister of Foreign Affairs still raises questions, the majority of the democratists are pleased with his explanation and say that the matter did not affect their general opinion on him.
However, it is different when viewing America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unsatisfactory in his explanation, and only about one third is satisfied.
The people shared their views in March shortly after the daylight.
Most of the Americans say that e-mail parabolics did not affect their overall mind about Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion on him has worsened.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their opinion about Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party's voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, only 32% of whom consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has decreased by 8 percentage points last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not considered honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trumpi to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trumpi are considered to be good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion about him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trumma in national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates gathered half of all the votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight the footer.
The Republican voters throughout the country still strongly support Trumpi, whose support has risen from 23 per cent of the CBS's question on Tuesday to 27 per cent of the previous question before the Fox News election debate last month.
At the same time, however, Carson rose from six percent to 23 percent.
The survey also found that Carson is doing very well with different demographic groups and is extinguishing Trump’s high-skilled Republican voters.
The rest of the field have been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen most: from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third in 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of this latest 376 Republican voters in September is +/- 6 per cent.
Last week's last CNN/ORC survey showed Carson's rise in the surveys: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is above him by 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly above Carson.
When Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgery for nothing, even though Carso apologised to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday his campaign visit in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of a first year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, a murder accusation has been brought against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back loaded a bag of more than 13 kg full of sand, after which he was repeatedly taculated to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field towards the finish.
Finally Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he lost his consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng was dizzy, but according to the charges, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, to find online information about his symptoms, and to contact the National President of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told at the press conference.
"Here, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
And he died the next morning.
According to the autopsie protocol, Deng has repeatedly hits on the head, body, and thighs of a stupid object.
"Too many families have been subjected to brotherhood scourge when at least one student died every year as a result of it since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a Deng family lawyer, in his opinion.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step for the authorities.
The Grand Jury in Monroe was in favour of the first five members being charged with murder of a third degree.
32 other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also charged with violence and criminal conspiracy.
"We don't want to be responsible only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind what happened, which accepted the situation either formally or informally, they should also be held responsible," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College forbids the brotherhood and the national brotherhood unlocked its connection to the local department.
This happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The rise in interest rates will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, the yields of bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes or how long it takes.
The past hardly helps with timing, especially in the economy.
The return of the recession has lasted after the first increase sometimes only 11 months, sometimes again has passed as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a factor determining how economic and financial assets react.
Therefore, officials of the US Central Bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the development cycle of the period to normalise the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the same way.
In the end, however, the market participants can find that all the increase in interest rates has been overwhelmed.
"The first increase after the global economic crisis of the Central Bank is inevitably interpreted in some circles to the end of the 'good money' era," said Capital Economics's global financial expert Julian Jessop in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, although still low, to a reversing shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it would have no effect.
Below is an overview of how some economic components will react on the basis of past developments:
As has been seen on the market over the last month, the expectation of an increase in interest may make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not quite that dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," the German Bank’s analyses in a recent study stated what would happen after the increase in the central bank.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14 per cent approaching the increase, 250 days afterward, the situation is fairly smooth (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and normal status has been achieved after 500 days, with average returns in six last cycles of 14.4%, according to the recent analysis of the leading capital strategy of the Nuvee Asset Management, Bob Doll, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when returns begin to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest purchases often contribute to their income.
In the present situation, the Central Bank faces certain challenges that have not been faced before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is in particular the gross domestic product, which will be the nearest to its lowest level in all times before the ECB's interest rate.
According to the Deutsche Bank, in 118 increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has only been less than 4.5 per cent twice.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6%, few believe that it will last after the third quarter has progressed 1.5%, reports the Atlantic Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic situation may be risky and raise the question of "is this time different", the Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants are prepared to increase the ECB throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the prospect of a merchant trade is only 25%.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all the rise cycles have hitherto occurred in supercycli of increased stimulus, where GDP has passed its pre-declining peaks very quickly after the recovery has begun," reports.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been overwhelmingly waiting for the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already 74 months.
The fixed return has also been instable while the market is waiting for interest rates, and the model resembles some of the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will be seen more quickly in debt securities than in shares.
The direction of the returns on debt sheets seems to change immediately with the first increase/reduction of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on debt securities will fall immediately," Deutche Bank said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to convergence of the yields of long- and short-term debt securities, thus stimulating the return curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still careful with regard to the search for a return", Schwab's solid-income analyst Kathy Jones stated in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the more stringent monetary policy prospects," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is more stable, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are market-specific when the central bank has tightened its lines.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a great deal of debt are doing worse when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that 'quality' shares are generally more profitable in three months after the first interest rate," Goldman Sachs's analyses stated in its customer report.
Undertakings with strong turnover missed weak turnover by an average of five percentage points after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares achieved better performance than those of low quality companies, with an average of 4 (per cent) and 3 (per cent).
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies with a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Savingers can also gain more profit, even though experts disagree with how quickly they feel.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Mr Andrew Bingham says
Conservative National Representative Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "citizens"
He claims that it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards awards, saying that they only travelled the Brit Awards awards.
Ms Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming" into Classic FM, claiming the leading MP to increase the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not.
The Conservative National Representative Andrew Bingham also said to BBC's leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to make its content "national" and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "citizens" - is becoming a Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards award, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, only appear to be a British Awards gaal held under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I directly remember, when you actually just copy something that you can already find on the market," Bingham said.
BBC’s CEO contested the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far above its commercial competitor in terms of live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to living music and music is in fact first class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Previously this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to work more than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of BBC's offer criticised for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition that BBC bought from a Dutch production company from Talpa Media for estimated GBP 22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not in any way owned?
Lord Hall argued that this BBC1 channel program, with the star judges of Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced in the BBC style.
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success inside his own house" next time it started a entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of the future The Voice seasons, nor to order that the money of the authorizers should be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales have risen the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month, the increase was the lowest after the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday may reduce consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for more than a decade and has transformed many British shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of an upgrading of online sales, since the latest figures showed only 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew the least since the beginning of statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase last year.
Experts say that there are signs of improved online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rational in time," told Guardian, Andy Mulcahy, the JMRG sales index supplier.
He explained that three years ago, online sales became stronger when the buyers began to use their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it adjusts, and (growing) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been considered a reason behind slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will control shopping before the last Friday event in November.
Last year, the normal average of five times more buyers swept on their computers to capture the stores, covering the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which made the buyers argue about the discoveries, can control shopping.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
For certain products, such as television and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now being made from online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using fashion labels for shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Meka's elevator accident, sanctions on the Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funeral in Meca
Saudi Arabia has partially accused the collapse of a construction giant Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured when the shrimp collapsed.
29 men were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them; and the victims died, when the cockroach collapsed in the great mosque of Meca.
Most of the sadders dressed in white filled the route to respect the first dead who made their last journey to the Al-Moisem cemetery.
A sad walk passed a sacred place where only a few days ago the mosques fell through the roof of the mosque and threw down worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family as guilty of a disaster in which 394 people were also injured.
29 bodies of worshipers who were killed in the Mechanical Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram Bolton, from Manchester. He was on his first pilgrimage when he fell.
Akram had been in a big mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual shark pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mekka will continue when thousands of people arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the lever up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic version stated that Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it stated that the company's managers were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore that he would find out, which caused the fall of squirrels in the Grand Mosque garden, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before later this month's shark pilgrimage.
Binladin Group has not published any reports on the collapse of the horror and its representatives have not been caught for comments.
The royal decision also blamed the unit for not using updated safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
Around the Meka's big mosque there are dozens of lifters, which are part of the huge building robbery led by Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruler family for decades, and it is leading to major construction projects.
The former Al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son who was banned by the family in the 1990s.
The robbery took place in the wind and rain only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the sanctuary, each capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million dollars to be paid to the relatives of the dead and permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says that workers working cheaply in Eastern Europe are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using helpers' services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the increase
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country
Writer Rupert Steiner, city’s main correspondent to Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and landsmiths and to hire more skilled Eastern European workers to rehabilitate their homes
Looks like if you're handsome with a hammer or beat to paint walls, you're in a minority today.
The British sees more and more staff hired to carry out tea-sea work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new CEO of Kingfisher, owned by the home renovation chain, Veronique Laury said that the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at a ridiculous price.
This will result in Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix shops for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said he wanted more women to work for B&Q stores, because eight of the ten purchase decisions made in the store were made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more women's economies where there are more home rehabilitation than before.
Laury said, "The majority of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making."
Laury is one of the only five women who are leading the main companies of the UK FTSE100 index. He has rebuilt his management team so that there are as many male and female males.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with equal 50 % of women in the group, including its CEO and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - the difference here is important.
It hasn't been difficult to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher reported the decrease in both six months of production and sales after the group took over the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, the Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three-axis government decided to resort to compulsive legislation to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were achieved rather quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other salaried central organisations began to force the country at the same time and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the vast expression of workers.
A lot of people think there's also a sense in it.
Let's ask if it's worth the strikes when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to report that they are not going to participate in an expression of mind but are going to work.
In the old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but the open declaration of wealth would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few ten thousand people from a million professional organisations will not be much time, but it gives the subject of thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's tough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to the heavens.
After years of work seems to be rolling on their own weight, the alliances finally have the right to defend, visiblely and properly.
Thus, the government may want to capture the role of the Ay movement when membership in the union is perhaps more necessary.
If we are to be of any opinion about the activities of the organisations, it is awkward that Friday’s expression would in some way stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decrease and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Heavy savings for the University of Lappeenranna: As a goal of 8.5 million savings, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranna will start a savings curve with a total of EUR 8.5 million to reduce costs.
As part of savings, the university will start core staff negotiations with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
Other activities are also aimed at saving two million.
The Yt negotiations are underpinned by the budget for 2016, which anticipates actual activity to be 8.5 million deficits.
This also affects the cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial period, the University will produce a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will be reduced by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the University is around €85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between surgery in mass education and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very important," says Director Anneli Pauli at the University's newsletter.
Prior to the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be new.
Negotiations with trustees will be started next week on Tuesday and they will last for six weeks by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of the Halpabuss company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, says Souter.
Rail traffic is expected to be gradually open to competition.
The first is the nearest traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After short-range traffic, there is a long-distance traffic.
Souter already says he's approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, on the Ministry of Transport, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have indicated their interest in rail transport by at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows the page when the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
When Reuters asked 80 economic scientists a little more than half of those who still believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25 %.
This is a historical event, because the time the central bank cut interest rates at zero is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start the standardisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought billions of dollars to balance and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less pink global views.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for lifting, but the signs also show that they believe that the likelihoods are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 a.m. (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology message
After shooting her girlfriend in Mississipp Monday morning, before shooting her colleague later the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying she was "be sorry" for the first murder and hoped "to cancel it," the authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippin Gautier police told me that Delta State University's land science and social sciences teacher Lamb called the emergency number about 10:00 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said "he killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "no disturbs anyone", but probably is shocked.
The police asked the caller this name, but he didn't tell him.
Lamb didn't explain the shooting.
When the police got there, there was a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss' body and a 45-year-old Lambi's handwritten message, saying: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt, before finally killed himself late on Monday when the police moved him.
The University Director William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was no conflict, but that " clearly there was something in Lambi's mind."
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb had believed that Prentiss had been in relation to Schmidt, there was no "information or evidence" of any kind of "three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-th."
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a good person.
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "upset."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and her daughters were "the best friends of all of them."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online on his home. Sun Herald said Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lambi for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told Lambi to call his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lambi's highway 1 near Greenville later the same night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and went running into the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education science from Delta States in spring 2015, reports a merit list on the university's website.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really requires tax.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months because of a twin fracture
Luke Shaw got a double fracture on his right foot when Manchester United was defeated by PSV Eindhoven in a champion's League fight.
Although the defender stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury caused Héctor Moreno's holistic tactile in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had fallen into the PSV area.
He was treated 9 minutes in the field and had to give him oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's now in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then surgery in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, suffers from trouble and then plays great, and this is what's going to happen.
When I was in the dressing room, she had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months and he doesn't play in a block.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when she got a red card and a sentence shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal proposed that the Italian journalist be mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty strike and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot trunk.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses PSV
The British defender has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If any player gets out because of such a injury, everyone is very sad.
The aim of our players is never to insult the opponent.
Moreno's foot broke when he played in the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Championships.
"Moreno takes this hard because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it is bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's jacket.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn something: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long until it learns almost outside.
So, unless you're David Cameron.
When the childcare service asked the Prime Minister his favorite child book, he chose Dr. Seussin The Lorax, an environmentally friendly story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Happy, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or message that we haven't seen before."
All this is true, but the next song, in which Cameron probably describes the book's plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where a rather short original text had been added to new characters and details.
"In the city of Tarville inside, where all the nature has lost and even air is a merchandise, the boy Ted hopes to win his dreams to the heart of the girl by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says and describes the love scene that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, called Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not yet sufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text sounds at a place like it was taken from the Lorax project summary found on the Internet Movie Database website, which starts as follows: "In Tarville city inside the others, where everything is artificial and even air is a merchandise, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams to the heart of the Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would have been so unfamiliar with the book. There, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has destroyed greedy, smashing trees and cumbersome things, Kerskanen, without giving the story a name to the short, wise creature of Lorax, who "shouts for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who, apparently, has never read the book 20 times a day for a child.
The Prime Minister's reporter said that the text must have come from Cameron's electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of staying on the side of the English team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it is likely to repeat the last 3-0 series loss.
I wouldn't let the guest profit out of the bills.
Alastair Cook's side may have been less experienced than the team three years ago, but it has good rounders and the team's thinking is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, only young positives.
Moeen Ali is developing in its circular feeds and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell from the British cricket team, he replaces Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team must understandably be difficult to analyze for me because I am his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that the cricket players are criticized on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the press release, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England's main coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not perform as well as he could and it won’t surprise me. Lyth is primarily a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the beater will have to leave a trace.
Lyth was selected seven times in the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Compton alone got the opportunity to play both at home and at guests.
The only issue of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in perfect condition, but that lost chance is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a hit I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something that we in Yorkshire saw early in this season when he made 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but of course this depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moen has been embedded in a blow-off next to Cook, where an extra feeder would be given to the field, but they might hold four fast, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a beater could not hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be a pretty cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games at the first time, before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a stealer, and, the little thing I've been dealing with him, he feels very impressive as a young man.
People can look at his ungorgeous statistics, hitting average 31, with the ball 35, and thinking it's gambling, but there aren't too many feeders available and the voters chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for games can prove to be a genius stamp.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and brings with him an enormous amount of experience, because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the game of the white ball, and brings both energy and unpleasant rush.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in the international cricket, whether it's gambling or training, and he's got the same thing to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
Brittany's departure from the EU (Brexs) will be able to win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-life re-negotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU face ever more problems, although not even taking into account the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or not?" Corbyn's choice to be the head of the Labour Party or the irritation of the trade union organisation in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corby and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat friend recently explained that, as the EU is so deep in different crises, not all of which are its own cause, some Member States have been tired of the UK's self-center agenda, full of concessions and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union central organisation decided that it would not want them either if they cut off social protection.
We could call it Dave's and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance will be late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home and say that the supporters will win for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the British EU star - "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin is said - suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point that they don't care about us then we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his business before it goes to ruin the same way as it happened to the too long delayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande, France, is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a losing force, too.
Poland may soon have a national right government, Spain's left-wing.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves for the self-British people, as their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they don't want it either because of their own separatistic trends.
So, my friend presents, some of these ministers can even consciously plan to make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party during the UK 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The new negotiations had been organized" and "the new negotiations had no meaning for Britain."
The Europeans have experienced hardly how greedy the Fleet Street newspaper can be and how EU-sceptical press solicitors are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership started in 1973 was confirmed by 2:1.
They can very much remember Boris Johnson, the largest European opportunist, who made himself a name by writing "EU direct bananas" when he was a correspondent in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been stupid, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a large number of tax-exciting brigades, foreigners who hacked phones, as well as persons whose home is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but realised that if you're in a cage with a thirsty gorilla, bananas must be abandoned because of confusion unless you want to be on the lunch list of that gorilla and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more briljant than Blair himself, with regard to the opposition to Cameron's re-negotiation temperament, because Bair had accepted the principle behind the EU's rejected Constitution, which the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair out of the situation.
The press never forgives him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the Westminster House on Monday (I told him that he had no longer time to waste on me), would seem to be at risk of taking Neil Kinnock's 80s back into a boiling strategy for Murdochia, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in contact with the media. Not me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whose BBC sofa Corby left on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is, beautifully speaking, developing.
He says that we would like to remain in the reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the Ukipin War Hall and the most prosperous nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this view.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this on both radio and television this week, when his internal patroler would have wanted to admit that the choice of Corbyn to appoint the harsh John McDonnell as the shadow government minister of finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his grandpa tricked on TV trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party without going so far that he could lose his place of government.
Hilary's intrigues were more attractive.
But for the struggle to stay involved in "in any situation" - the statement of Benn - was not what McDonnell said, and not based on everything Corbyn told the heads and representatives at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of the communication is important during the day of daily TV, especially in the social media circles that are acceptable to the growth platform for paranoids and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is just fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the Labour Party in the referendum campaign.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks that.
But the basic tour of McDonnell and Corbyn regarding EU membership (and, therefore, in line with their Benn spirit-regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate about left-wing thinkers who have a central dogma in the optical struggles for the narcism of small differences.
With regard to his dualism with respect to NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby did not give up), foreign diplomas just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) for concessions to the UK when it can be completely wasteless?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Conservative Government is in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize Public Health’s Electric Tobacco Assessment in England
Researchers have said that the statement by the State-funded agency that electricity cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional originated in the 12-person meeting, some of which had connections with the tobacco industry.
Experts from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco in Lancet.
Last month, the PHE published this "postal column" report, depicting it as a "a comprehensive review of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published last month a chapter that attacked the PHE's main decision on the "extraordinarily ugly base".
Two other scientists written in BMJ have wondered if the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The primary principle of national health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim "on the best estimate of today's electricity cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of evidence.
In fact, it comes from one 12-person meeting, which developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the disadvantages associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is previously reported to have received funding for independent research by the Bristish American Tobacco company.
He also supported the public health powers of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding that he was reported to have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
There are no criteria for selecting members of the panel, but there are several well-known supporters of electricity tobacco, some of whom are also reporting that they have received funding from the research sector.
Others are not known for their expertise under tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the President of the PHE on tobacco.
The group's research "speakingly admits" that there is a lack of "unquestionable evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say the PHE claims that "there is no evidence that electric tobacco acts as a way to burn children or non-smoking" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of the PHE Health and Welfare, says that the claims made in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electric cigarettes are much less harmful than burning."
Half of the burnts of their life die of their dependence.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to investigate the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence appears and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public unconsciousness about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year of smoking-related disease and smoking costs NHS $2 billion each year.
By explaining the current evidence - i.e. even though electric cigarettes are not riskless, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says the former Channel 4 director
The former President of Channel 4 Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" about slowness such as this Albert Square series of soaps.
Johnson said that license fees should only be used to perform programs that other British broadcasters are not doing.
He criticised BBC for placing public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience, in difficult broadcast times against the most viewed programs of competitors and channels like BBC4.
After BBC's CEO Tony Hall said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he came into Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programs that would be clearly suited to non-subvened competitors," Johnson said to the High Room Communications Committee as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the permit fee is held - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this messager or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the most important missionary time, because it is intended to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, undoubtedly carried out within the house.
In fact, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand what it's about public service broadcasting.
I don't think it would weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4 by series entrepreneur Johnson said that BBC is responsible for hunting the audiences "because of the goals of people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His commentary on BBC’s most popular series is similar to Tony Ball’s commentary from the former Sky director. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sells series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public public service programmes "will go to BBC4 where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then hypocritically say, 'of course, we do all these unknown programs that nobody sees'.
They'll put them at a mission where no one will ever look at them.
With regard to the permit fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I challenge you to look for a more regressive system in which the most respondent is.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of money, but I don't know if it's true for those people who have 150 pounds of big money because they don't use BBC much.
The former Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also witnessed to the Committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should re-evaluate its early Reith mission "inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the numbers are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should take a model from Australia's and Canada's broadcasting and change the role to the form "inform, educate and entertain".
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he said are showing only some people on television, and join together with commercial companies so that all of them would be viewed online.
"Sound Genetics" enables control of brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the shuttles change the direction as soon as the sound-impulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them with sound waves.
Small shuttle lamas change the direction as soon as they are hit by a voice-impulse that is too high to hear the human ear.
The pulses function by connecting genetically modified movable nerve cells with ultrasound-reactive membranes.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the new method of sound genetics, which can use ultrasound to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
The Salk Institute Researcher, Sreekanth Chalasani, in California, told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep brain stimulation, which is an invasive measure that leads to electrical pulses to the human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Sukkulamados do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced the ultrasound waves that then walk into the worms.
Confirmed ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures in some worm cell cells.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate cells attached to them, reported in the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled shuttle lamas, Chalasani genetically edited worms so that some of their business nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified mats, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and passed them on to the mats where they connect modified business nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a career tool that allows scientists to connect nerve cells on and off by using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike light that must be sent along the optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent into the brain from the head.
"We believe that using genetic therapy and therapeutic virus it can be possible to promptly react to the target human nerve cells to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertising may be a shame on the British Arms Trade
Look at Amnesty International's anti-weapon fair video.
Awful killer machines!
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Bombs!
Both electric tampering bombs that cause painful pain but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and the comic language do not leave any doubt that this advertising of the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parodie that Amnesty International produced to highlight the British government's willingness to trade arms to the repressive governments at the ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard area.
Subject: DSEI armaments: authoritarian authorities arrive in London
A separate campaign also led to a number of posters on bus stops and metro trains requiring closer access.
"Important information, do you travel on the DLR route on 15-18 September?" together asks using the underground font and brand in London, when the DLR track turns into a picture of the tank.
This September, a bunch of arms dealers arrives on the DLR route... and customers are asked to help stop the arms fairs.
These 300 posters are made by the artists whose work was presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Christmas Plans).
Collectively called Special Patrol Group helped to spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is a six-pound package of six-pound keys, which collectively says "to access a third of the entire world's bus stop advertising space".
Transport for London is not enjoyed by this unauthorized "published vandalism".
One of the parodie advertisements produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the lecturer of the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and want to carry out political work to outside gallery audiences.
Many artists have begun to work with activists in their struggles when they have realized that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another poster against arms trade greets the workers in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook over the last 24 hours, more than 100,000 times. It created a free advertising office VCCP, and also a graphic designer and background reporter worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the arms fairs were not advertised at all - and then there was an empty point in ExCeL's calendar - and he thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of a ambiguous corporation, but "was more stopping to stress it with bright colors and animation".
"They have done a great job to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the British government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally in our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the arms fairs comes from the inside of ExCeL when samplers trade fantasticly beautiful products.
Saab revealed in his press release that he had received an order from the U.S. Army from the "At4CS RS shot off the shoulder".
This includes a "unique tube-stop point, which places excellent effects on the inside of the armor".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student residence
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student's home when I was 19 years old, and I still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the people's smiles I've been irritated by, and many, long complaints from others.
A large part of what I learned can be merged in eight simple rules.
Moving to a residential home can be anything from a completely frightening thing that goes to the nerves.
It's attractive to do this: tell me where you're from, whether you were holding the middle year and what you're thinking about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just a melting extract HAHAHA I find in my room".
Breathe.
And also help others breathe, ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find those people you like, not those you don't want to talk to even if your eyebrows were in fire and they shared the triggers.
Give people room.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktails, movie facilities and high-quality entertainment places, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.

Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments consist of a culture of walking from one room to another, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say "I love you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking with you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socialization and maybe send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
You know, knocking when the speech came, knocking.
One guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Get friends through baking.
As you start the university in the peak of the bakery trend, knocking people's doors with a chocolate timber board and showing yourself seems to some degree less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the 1950s.
Offering self-made delicacies is a great way to get friends.
Your living mates are obliged to talk, and they may continue to unite your face with a rural surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you can bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat coats are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
I understand taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk from your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It's possible that they'll allow you to boil inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to look at it more adultly than my housemate who blew the laundry in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't talk to people so that they can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent human being, but because you're like that vocabulary's patter swinging the cat.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music slower because it was three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the sound power.
When they finally silenced at 5:00 a.m., the girl kindly allowed them to sleep for two hours before making their own music shrink, locked her door and went to a three - hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move to the same place as you?
Or vice versa, would it not be unbelievably embarrassing if you were to be your future spouse, you would put yourself together, you would divorce, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends together with him.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if the hot apartment partner really is not your future partner, you could even try to make sense to your lower head.
In a joyful moment when you find that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between the poster and the temptation is narrower than it seems.
It's fun, but it's cancellable in a few moments.
You can give us a useful and fun teaching about security by hiding something, but don't ever mess with someone's room with teeth and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a water glass, then put them in a freezer, but don't attach their property to the roof with a blue stop, but not twice.
To the residence of foreign students racist attack on the Kite - a house designed as a reception centre was inserted in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out at the campus of foreign students at Kite in North Carolina.
Unlike the police mentioned earlier, this is not the accommodation facilities for minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping mats of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Kiteen Evangelical People's University.
The University's housing windows and walls were scratched with racist marks, such as hackers, and a metallic object had been thrown through one accommodation window, says East Finland's police.
According to Lukas, the responsible teacher for the training of young people in social security at the University was estimated to have 10 people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The University has hosted people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in the confused building have a-statements.
Some are studying at adult base school, some are in professional studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland.
East Finland's police investigate the attack as a damage and a breach of home peace.
According to Lukas, a briefing was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had more than a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
According to the Lukas, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The authors are suspected that at least three men had been on the move with a white passenger car.
I think this is the end of the youth's weekend, since this topic has now been on the top.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, a hospital with a planned reception centre.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about this on his website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn by a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a crime report to the police.
Details 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information from the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state stops the Y train for the Karjah. Passengers close to them, "heavy idiots."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karjama ceases to travel in March.
The news threw passengers on the main railway station in Helsinki who climbed the train early in the evening.
In particular, the downturn strikes the blessings, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's pretty stupid, because the number of people is growing all the time, and people working need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't depend on anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video will come to the capital even if it's a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
The position of Purola in Lake and Nuppulinna in Tuusula is out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the following contract period.
The contract period varies over the year and the routes can be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement finalising in autumn will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a Siuntio, believes that the state train operator is a short-sighted operation.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there's a repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-racesporians and blessings, as it is fast and passs several stations.
In Espoola Annina Pöyry, on the train, the fate of those traveling beyond the city area was horrified.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain in the Y train.
There's a little relief in the promise.
A new train connection that replaces the Y-train in the region of Helsinki Region of Transport (HSL) will probably be coming to the beach, i.e. to Kirkkonumm.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million per year, the Ministry certainly has much more.
The R line coming on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, the number of train mountains in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened into the Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train mountains are decreasing on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made at the end of the service, with a total of approximately nine million travels purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Timeliness of Capital: "Marx should be familiarized"
The crisis in the world economy has raised Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work published in 1867-1894, writes the topic of Marx's capital, known as the former president of the SKP, in the book today published by Yrjö Hakanen.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and invasion in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginative capital have proved surprisingly far-reaching.
The bookwriter's list of books based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakaska is also available as Professor of the Aalto University, renowned economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is the current "now and forever".
However, the former CEO of the Department of Economic Research and the Department of Economic Affairs is not Marxist, is it?
Not at least.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not think Marxi is an actual economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, societal sciences have been differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary tutor.
"Usually, the idea is that the history of the idea tells us about the false opinions of the dead men," Korkman starts.
True, Marx's prophecies went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the original spirit of capitalism too far, Korkman thinks.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"Most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technological transformation," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx will not be helpful.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Yet Marx is in the interest of Korkman.
"In the 1970s, Marxi could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maesians and Trotskyans and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more versatile and Marxi can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should be acquainted with Marx's thought world - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports the AFP news office.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamil clubs for war crimes.
In the civil war in Sri Lanka, at least 100,000 people are estimated to die.
There's no exact information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as the UN report requires.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be victims as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of imposing sides and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN Court because of foreign judges.
In England's yo experiment, the social media scored
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language in the high school writings of the autumn, which was mostly English.
More than 16,000 students were tested in England's skills.
In the experiment, it could have been written about social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the written 150-250 words in English could be shown to the user of the online magazine's advice palette.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He was asked how parents should look at things for young people as well.
A total of four subjects were to be selected.
"It was the most difficult of them," evaluated the third topic in Porvoo at Swedish-swedish high school lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
Lybeck said the fourth subject was quite nice again.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment "a bit normal".
In Finnish or Swedish, the English experiment allowed questions to be answered on texts that, for example, benefit from the adaptation of the summer campus to climate change and the treatment of large masses of information.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The writings of the autumn continue on Friday, and then the test of another domestic or Swedish or Finnish.
At high school, the test is conducted normally, i.e. the statement of the employees does not affect it.
The University Board of Apprentices urges the testers to search for appropriate connections in time to allow them to attend the trial.
Additional time can also be given if it can be shown that the delay was not due to its own carelessness.
Orula was robbed by a gun.
On Wednesday morning, Oulu was robbed of a store in the Belle District.
According to the police, the robber had dressed up with dark clothes and a cover-up face.
He's a normal man and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a gun and got a small amount of money to catch.
It's being investigated as a gross robbery.
Police reserves the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support teams from other countries of Finland
The statement of opposition to the government's surgery decisions will be blocked on Friday in central Helsinki, predicts the police.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the Associations of SAK, Akava and STTK will meet on the Railway Road at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to participate in the expression of mind.
In turn, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothness of the gigantic expression.
Roads leading to the railroad are closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30-14 a.m.
Only alarm vehicles are left in the area.
From the direction of the hakaniemi, the traffic will be cut off from the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Lieutenant Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it looks like it's enough.
I'm not going to take a stand on the police's work fights.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The police don't tell you exactly what they're doing.
"Something is coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police urge to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic package extends from Hakaniemi level to its nuclear centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the evening.
There are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki with protesters from other countries.
They're not allowed to go to the Iron Road.
The buses are basically staying a little far away.
The rest of the journey must then walk to the protest site," Kujala says.
The opinion also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, this is a positive part.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large people's meetings, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the statement have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are expecting the expression of the mind to be calm.
People are usually working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," Kujala says.
Local expressions will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's expression is in many ways exceptional, do you remember these strikes and expressions?
The big expression of the professions organized on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen, Professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder that the Ay-business is protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise hands in front of the government, the Blue says.
The very right-wing government has struck the core points of the Finnish corporacy tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard extracts are intrusive in contract law.
This is a lot of features of the fact that the ay business is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not at all have the support of all payees for the expressions of the mind on Friday.
The new one is now the sharp division that is created by the expression of mind among those whose ay-business would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed persons gathered across Finland showed their views at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday’s expression, it could be a gigantic demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorston, Sininen says, in 1993.
The Murrostorstai, organized in the middle of the deepest depression, gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The Government of Esko Ahon (Central) compensates from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the Employee Organisations had never been as bad as they were during the Mayorship Board of Aho.
Now between the government and the Ay movement may still be worse than in Murrostorst.
In addition, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power, says Siisinen.
The current government coalition is still in such an interesting way that it is so tightly right, despite the speeches of the Finnish fundamentals.
There were some elements of the old labour movement at the time of the rod.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The message also stops public transport and possibly closes homes and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive undivided support from the payees, it can become the largest for years.
Around 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're put on the edge.
Traditionally, the Finnish Ay movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have been tightened over the past few years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
Mental displayers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of expression changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes on, among other things, pilots and pilots.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
There were 70,000 metal men involved in the metal men's lay.
The strike was suspended after seven weeks of the strike, on the basis of a proposal from the Conciliation Board.
Metal men got a 16% increase in wages.
The electricity blow in spring 1977 took 49 days and caused electricity breakouts all over the country.
Murder Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed, met before the Parliament House to show their views on the work.
Firefighters striked three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were forced into egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia to teach, the EU to stop," was one of the slogans.
To Espa, the farmers squeezed tons of snow.
The EU Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn the breweries in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been in a strike in 1983.
Some deaths occurred during the strike during the 1995 strike.
Tehy threatened by the strike and the dismissal of nurses in 2007.
In the end, the threat of mass decommissioning accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors striked in 2001
"The doctors in the strike - forced," was the slogan of the striker doctors in 2001.
The attack of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a vigorous discussion on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for study support from the Senate to the Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
Central Crime Police finds the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian Police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Crime Police in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees on board in Aisterheim near the German border.
There is no information on whether the truck was possibly on the way to Finland.
All those in the cold truck were in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the event site in Austria, reports Chief Commander Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, the fate of other refugees traveling on the truck rides in Austria was worse.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died apparently by suffocation.
According to the Public Radio, on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish stock company.
The company operates, among other things, a restaurant business and its CEO is an alien background, a man about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
A refugee-smuggling captain, former drug courier and a smuggling businessman, the story of five smugglers
The king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the stylish missionary, and the taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people carry out human trafficking transport to the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Office appears in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the lobsters of human smuggling, present conclusions and present smugglers on the different portal of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them away from your thoughts right away.
Church Islands in the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for summer holidays.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also excellently suited for smuggling, as it is only 120 kilometres away from the island of Lampedusa, Italy.
For this comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain burning in the chain, and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with blue, ten meters of wood boats hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, 40 people will be able to fill it.
For one trip, Emir earns about EUR 8 000 after the expenses.
Emir has five helpers who are looking for him for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape anxiety.
After that, the situation calmed up until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the continent to Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as you can see good.
Food is given so that customers just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer ends with the money, it's their problem.
They're going to the waters with the lights they can turn off at midnight.
The first night you drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and in 20 meters high waves passengers cry and vomit.
At destination, the human child has been landed in half an hour and Emir is leaving for the return journey.
Emir wants him to be scared.
That's why he's hitting his clients and at least claiming to beat the hangers to death.
He says in the book that when the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I loved customers one by the neck and threw them over the edge," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
He said his peasants had to abuse this.
I'm gonna kick them out of your mind right now.
We need to show them who's in charge.
Normal taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. The starter engine is pulling the last ones, and anyway, it's seen the best of his days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that a taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to the south.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly lodged.
Men traveling in forests surrounded by the centre without their family will be accommodated in tents, booths and abandoned cars, which anyone has now managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest also have failed to apply for asylum in Serbia for reasons or for others.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walks in a difficult countryside, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
Finally, when people arrive in the Bogovaða region, at the main point of human smuggling, they are dying.
The Cypriots of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their things once and that's enough," Gora praises.
He says the Africans are trying to tinch.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
You silly bastard's gonna be silly all the way.
First, it will be agreed at a price of 300 euros, then it will fall to 200 and finally offer 150 euros.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than anyone else and he's only going to charge 50 euros per person to the Hungarian border.
It's a trip of 300 miles, most of it is comfortable on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about €50,000 a year.
It is not a big sum for the smuggler, but a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport immigrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his cyans to a mile away from the border.
Then he's showing his clients the right direction and sweeping away.
The work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers fled from Congo, as well as a small centre that helps Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Messenger runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and takes care that the white necklace rubber tape is stylishly gripped under the lower necklace of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedex, his car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the client will call one of the Sender’s five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money in a whisper and bend among cross-border merchants.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seekers or refugees to the Ugandan authorities, it is necessary to tell them that there are, for example, war areas in North Kivu and that they have been forced to escape domestic violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Messenger will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old identity certificate will be destroyed and the replacement will be acquired.
It helps the missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police.
The client will then be sent to the same place where true asylum seekers go: the asylum search procedure, to NGOs, finally to UNHCR.
The missionary feels bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He bills for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs approximately EUR 100, handling documents to the humanitarian organisation about EUR 150 and moving, for example, to one European country, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice creams
Tom's a smuggler, a former drug addict.
Fourty Irish days are taking place on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to load people to trucks traveling to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver and tens of truck drivers who don't necessarily even know they're in a human traffic business.
In the night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people from some of Calais's center.
They're driving the A26 motorway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would be sent to prison directly from organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs with customers over the motorways to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing through the channel to the British.
Tom's picking up a suitable truck... to make sure that it's on his way to England, and not to Holland, and to cut off the cover guard.
It needs to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the chauffeur is involved in the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into aluminum foil, the same that is wrapped around the baker or oven potato in the kitchen.
It's supposed to stop the police's heat scanner from seeing a hidden person.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that he didn't drive any flashers before Britain at least.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human traffickers.
The turkish turkist has been called a champion of marketing and an uncontested king of illegal Mediterranean landings, who governs sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands money.
One of the new methods is luxury ship cheating: Turkish ports are rented for a few days to bring American or European families to tourist crossroads.
In fact, the ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans who are transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe for a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until they have the time to leave.
People are smelting into minibuses and driving somewhere to the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, we need to get on the ship quickly.
Passengers must hide the entire journey under the deck.
The sea reserve can only observe how deep the ship swims, because other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers go out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury ship trip after the expenses.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, shelterers and other minors to handle their work in turn.
During the summer, transport is organised for at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is supposed to have purchased the land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
The American Olympic Runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a racer of 1,500 meters three times in the Olympics, has raised attention in the United States.
In his book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about the termination of his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in perfect condition and ran in the brushes for the second best time.
But in the final, he was panicked.
He flew to the top right at the beginning and defended his leadership with a earthly run.
However, 150 meters before the finish, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the line of painting, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bipolar disorder.
His brother, Dan, had committed suicide a year before the Sydney races, and he himself felt enormous pressures on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
He also appealed to his husband to accept his activities.
The Favour Hamilton taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me he's using the money for luxury life.
One of the explanations made by Favor Hamilton to become a prostitute was that he also needed adrenaline sticks similar to those he had received in competition in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The twin life of the former star runner appeared at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton took part in the Olympics of Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters in the world’s first statistical year of 3.57,40, but remained last at the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the federation put the Norwegian ski flower in the discipline:
The Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of suitability in at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian skiing union have turned around all summer and autumn, like last year, the sporting agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for multiple world champions and Olympic winners.
The result of the dispute decided to exclude Northug from the coming World Cup.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski flower under control.
"Thank you for showing your backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski union and Northug is about money.
Apparently Northug would like to be a part of the season of the country team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations and will not give one athlete in solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he assured that he wanted to play in the Norwegian colours in the World Cup next season, as well as then in the World Cups and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM-millions in his career, of which two are gold.
Last winter, he was involved in the team that won the gold of message in Falun.
The day of the shielding of the translators is also spent in the North
On the day of the shield of 25 September, temptations will be held in different restaurants and stores for which the Shield of the Pastors has been awarded.
Today's goal is to highlight Finland's high-level food skills and to lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital region, but that high-quality restaurants that are audited and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
International attention received from the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of the awareness of the conditions and organisation.
The day will be held on the ground in Vaasa, a restaurant in Fondis and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant is part of the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has therefore been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events that will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Indicted to the Chancellor on the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish the refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava equipment currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the Critical Infrastructure of the Crisis continues to be permanently located in the region, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, Finland Erillisnät Oy.
The Kauhajoki magazine states that the placement of a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have an interest in the area of the former Airport School and the airport, whose impact has not also been investigated during the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The case states that negotiations have been held for the last two years with regard to the Kauhava field on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of any foreign operator to the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (p.) and Head of Office of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person notes to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former equipment area is wrong.
The City Hall of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Soja: the situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic region
Administration means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those present here, so it comments on the journalists in the evening after having met the presidents of all Parliamentary parties in their official residence in Mäntymi.
According to the President, the concern about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it worthwhile that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially traditional issues.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to the Societ, the situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic region.
It is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia will be able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to affect the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the societary, the NATO issue was also ignored in the debates.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels on Friday 16 domestic flights, starts catching a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
It is reported from Finavia that the airport operations are intended to be operated during the work with seniors.
However, security inspections and other service points are expected to have a buffer and delays.
Congratulations closes the streets of the city of Helsinki
The demonstration to be held on Friday will close the streets in the centre of Helsinki.
The police tell us that the streets leading to the Railway Road are closed from cars around 9:30-14.
From the direction of the Mannerheimins, cars are not allowed to go to Mine Street, Postgata, and Työolönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From the Union Street Hakaniemi direction, transport is directed to the Union Street on the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and Rail Drivers throughout Friday in the mindlight
Metro and tram drivers will take part in the morning morning and night traffic on Friday.
The railway and subway staff association told the STT this evening.
Most of the Alki is closed for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's mindset also causes disturbances in Post's services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of day mail.
Most of the mail service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Red Cross of Finland is handled despite the fall.
Food transport as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also sought to be handled.
Status information on services can be found on the Post website.
Most of Finland's Alkies will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Pam has advised his employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Mr Pam has also called on daily traders to participate in the professional opinion.
SOK's and Kesko's representatives tell Helsinki's News that the stores are aimed at keeping open, if necessary, with the superiors.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual transactions.
Helsingin day care homes partially closed
Helsingin day-care facilities do not work fully on Friday, informs the Helsinki Early Education Agency.
Because of professional organisations' mentality, day care may be concentrated on certain day care homes and no club activities are organised in day care and playgrounds.
Environmentally disabled day care homes and groups of disabled people and children with multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for disabled and autistic students are normally organised.
The Early Education Agency promises to inform more about changes in the activities tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipila, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a direct channel of speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not stay for the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will become.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be communicated in the future on the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as a channel, let's see.
Now this channel is used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipila, the situation of Finland's economy is to a serious extent that it requires a television and radio speech to be held to citizens.
This set of issues, on which we are now talking, is rather complex and requires longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 p.m. on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also look at it at Yle Areena.
Sipilä is taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's television speech will not tell us about a more general reversal of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more closely in their own hands and to refuse public debate on questions?, says Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
Remembers Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
On behalf of the democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be related to each other.
Heavenen understands that commercial media are enraged by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not communication issues in democracy.
The role of media representatives is to ensure that political leaders are not given.
It's a big risk for Sipile.
In his speech, Sipila should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations placed on the speech can be met.
Is there more that we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or to say something new?
Heavenen says that if there is only more the same old one in the permit, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this context, it is common to take a risk in the sense that it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a mediator for politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or with the general line.
Slim Bet
In the coming speech of Sipila, it is also important that the media researcher stresses what the Prime Minister does not say.
Tonight we need to look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where no, says research coordinator Heikki Kuutti at Jyväskylä University.
According to the sixth, the TV speech is a clever bet from Sipil, because this way this can bring out its own view without the sorrow.
This will bring a large audience without a journalist's filter, unlike at the press conference, where journalists can put critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interpret something wrong about the speech, because there are no precise questions to be raised.
It's very important to see how Sipilä performs on the TV. It's like sweat casts, it's gonna shake his hands.
He compares Sipil with the father figure that now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to put it up well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would inform about something, because in this case a person is like talking directly to another person.
Such (US President Barack) Obama and partners regularly practice this type of activity.
Very Exceptional
Politician Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens is really exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to make the Finnish people sympathetic with the extortions ahead.
Employee organisations will organise a demonstration on Friday and strike against government action.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, said that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that we could also discuss the speech.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (Sd.), again announces that he is challenging the dialogue with Sipila.
We don't have time for monologists now.
It's about six months from the elections.
You can't hide in the end, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on escape has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition at the time of his discovery.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the case for Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later at night, he couldn't be contacted.
My father thanks all the people who have been looking for help.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
The Finnish UFC star disappointed young people with violence: You get anger
The Kurdish free fighter Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to immigrant backgrounds for young people.
Makwan Amirkhani had a strong speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me he received a message calling for an Instagram account.
There are videos downloaded on the account where young people fight with the most violent grips.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the wildness of young people.
A 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick down the ground, sit on the other, and hit unseenly without thinking about these consequences when you make these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinose, fighting videos to social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
That's the fact that you're fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite awkward.
A little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be visitors here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are ever subjected to racism, you may blame yourself for it.
Now, think a few times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is making contributions to racism.
You'll have to make such an aggression that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and that's what you're going to do. You won't make them better, Amirkhanini decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly tells Twitter that on Monday, the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Previously on Wednesday, STTK informed the Government of its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity sector required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Mr Akavan president, Mr Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require SAK's largest payroll organisation to soften its previous position.
SAK President Lauri Lyly, for his part, commented briefly on this on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and the need for agreements between active parties instead of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that the proposal by the Government of Prime Minister Sipila for a social agreement was not suitable for SAK.
In the past, Sipilä discontinued the negotiations on the social agreement, when SAK did not agree to commit itself to the target of the 5% productivity segment.
Comment: The big-minded protest threatens to get close to it, "I think it's a little funny to get a fist."
It feels a little funny to get a box if there's already a reconciliation paper in the pocket, writes Pekka Tiinane.
The atmosphere varies in the payroll camp.
Is it supposed to call the government to revoke or even agree with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders of SAK blasted holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to get caught.
The mud spread to the acavals, too.
The OAJ was threatened by the closure of schools and nurseries.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was chaired by the STTK.
He said that he had been in contact with the government and drafted an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) for a 5% productivity reduction.
The Akava President Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately urged him to announce that his agreement paper is already ready.
At first, SAK's office did not belong to a nutshell.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
However, Lyly finally announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would seek solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint presentation of employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5 % productivity target.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of Palola, director Jukka Ihanus, responsible for the social impact of the STTK, was formerly the Special Assistant of Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhase and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola also found that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Incidentally or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit away from Finland's seizures, whose sparkling image is disrupted by the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I think it's a little funny to get a box if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not be repeated"
The President of the Russian Duma Sergei Naryshkin criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
The President of the Russian Duma Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the September Session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July celebration meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to come to the meeting - a matter which the President referred to as a reminder of the journalists.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This shouldn't happen again, Naryshkin insisted on Interfax's news office.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the criticism of Naryshkin was addressed to the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pierce Finland with praise and thanks to Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanervan (kok) in the Ulan Bator meeting, which, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock faces the real playoff-tick: "Targets tight"
Tappa and Castle continue today in Hakametsa bull days when both are in fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamwald there are no real paintings.
Yesterday, the killer went to Kuopio to pick up the 3-2 win on KalPa.
The rise was male, because last season's silver group was the worst of two goals' loss.
The lock Tuesday was more mellitus.
The spacemen's catching tactically started Blues' guest was round zero point, and the loss readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any game similar to last year, Lock attacker Janne Lahti predicted positions on the company's pages.
The kill has formed a pretty playoff nightmare for the Romanians.
For in the last two seasons, the killer has just dropped in the middle of the Luko final series.
At both times, a decisive seventh game has been required for the solution.
Last season The Lås took the series to the break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three sides and passed.
There are no significant changes in the groups' compositions, except for goalkeepers.
We're gonna have to get both of the cassas who have rejected them yesterday, and they're getting a smiling shift today.
On the painting of the killer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the locks, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: In progress with a sad play
The sports director Toivola manuscripted an inappropriate follow-up to the main coach Rail Hall, written by Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone manuscripted the Rocky film, in which he himself played the main part.
The submariner set up a sensational campaign for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola manuscripted a restless ash story in Por.
The nameless and wooden breeze went forward to the 2006 SM finals as a surprise for everyone.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough basin respondents like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop games, players colored their heads red and cut the iroceses.
Hopeful became a blonde.
A great TV reporter JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Asses took a won silver.
Hopevola was one of the heroes.
The manuscript Toivola believes that this season's novelty works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who is the leader of the sporting activities has built a fleece on the part of the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have smuggled guys in a trunk like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than boiling.
Hopevola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Eisenkallio.
Karri Stone has crucified the Iron Hall Sean Connery.
In Toivola's rocky, the iron coat is as silly as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing else in the Iron Hall than Rocky's favorite name.
The game philosophy of the iron coil does not include cruise and small-sweeping.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's different to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garret Stafford took Tapparan Jere Karjala to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Curtain put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I do not accept such a game, nor does it belong to the ashes, the hot-handed Eisenkallio threw after the game to the Satakunta People.
The team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and elevators.
There are no key men in the best gaming age.
No wonder the main coach has complained about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Eisenkallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, Iron Callio answered diplomaticly.
Underneath the surface, let's go.
The 1953 Iron Curtain is well-knownly interested in moving to Toivola's place as a sports manager.
The men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance in the three leagues of the season has just as many losses on the score of 1-6.
Hopevolan wouldn't have been in favour of writing a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband at Tuukan's teenage age, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of her husband.
Yes, in the movie, I'll play my husband's friend's mother.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temone laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bassador and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga plays for the first time in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the early years of the Apulana film, you made us a beautiful movie, a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppas and supports his son, although his father Risto (presenting Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have known my real example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to present the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka that he trusted me.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have been very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, messed up.
The chip has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, it also understands that the drama is drama, and the truth may have to be coloured a little bit.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulana would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 1990s, there was a depression, and it was really bad.
It was quite a little probability that someone really succeeded, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me he had heard a lot from Tuuka about this young one before film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the name of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s infamous chess story.
Olga was a regular and nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have loved him secretly.
Olga says he's been working so much with Tuuka over the last 10 years that a big joint project is not scared.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production group goes to Heinola for a month.
However, because of their little children, the couple in Iti is often planning to drive home for night, because the distance is not too long.
We're gonna take the whole Heinola for a month.
They have taken us really warmly, just asked what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to be Finland's hottest play movie
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film directed by Timo Bergensola is EUR 17 million.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Bergensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifie movie Iron Sky's follow-up, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most calmest of all times in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
The title of the oldest film in Finland was Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is under way will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of more than EUR 100 million.
The film film produced by Timo Bergensola and Tero Kaukomaa begins in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Bergensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scared.
I've been sick of relaxing!
I'm so relaxed with the manuscript, because I know exactly what kind of movie I'm supposed to be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more enthusiastic, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he tells Iltalehti.
Initially, the budget for the film was 8-10 million, but the budget also increased as the manuscript evolved.
It's a big budget, but it's a big drill.
However, 100 million people would have to penetrate the film because each angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything's turned so tight that there's no looseness.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a bundle financing campaign and a bundle loan with an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined according to demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years later, the company will repay the loan.
The film shows Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trend sets have recently decorated large logos.
Still some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in the word.
The advertising of a hop or T-shirt was seen as a junt.
But times change.
Sport has become the right fashion megatrend, and as well old, familiar sports labels such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness of the wavebrush.
And as so often before, the funny and trendy limit is bleaching: if something is already right, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came a norm core trend, i.e. a fashion of style, in which trends were surprised by popularizing as boring basic clothes as a way to separate from the mass.
Now we put on the grey base collage instead of the already buried netshirt on the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer's logo is beautiful.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logs, for example, Adidas' identifiable rail networkers, the favorite team game shirts and the New York Yankees lips have made a return to the repentance.
So now the Calvin Klein logos of the bastards are a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the chest of Versace’s causal bags makes it clear what a significant requirement is.
Would you be ready to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I wasn't stuck in the tank lock for hours!
According to the claim, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 presented Russian war industry products.
In recent days, colourful claims have been made in the Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Affairs had to remove the large Zotovia tank hole for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to be sniffing the pansar vehicle's bone in quite good atmospheres and not at least on the basis of their pictures, it's not about stucking or annoying.
That's so stupid.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into a battle tank, but it was a bump tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel, I've been serving at Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and I came out peacefully, Zotov said to Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
In the exhibition, Zotov explained to the Russian army television channel that he admired Russia's new technology because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the cars, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the jar, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all tank tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called a reporter who wrote it stupid.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm long and rotten, but anything that I'd been stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotovi’s words are supported by the fact that no photograph of alleged jail has been published, even though there were a total of 50,000 people in the exhibition during a few days.
The claim that Zotovi was caught started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told to rim out of the tank lock when trying to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story where the organizers of the exhibition told us their own view of the event.
Everyone's just used to the soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But the MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way he sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

A Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilän mine has been leaked.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment pool.
According to the company, measures to remedy leakage have been initiated.
There is neutralized enrichment and cleansed process water in the field of the winding process.
In general, water is pumped to be reused as process water or, as authorised, to the environment through the surface casting field.
The leakage was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current licensing conditions.
The rest of the material didn't go into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection cycle on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the basin dam structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the IMF is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation patroled with structural reforms covering Finland to address economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of over-work allowances and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, structural reforms are agreed, but there are small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of message for government action, but, on the other hand, there are also warnings about what should not be cut too much.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the Economy.
In the opinion of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts a 0.4 per cent economic growth for Finland for this year, which will rise to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske forecasts today that growth in the new cyclical forecast will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They might have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in small growth in summer, Kuoppamäki says.
The weakened confidence of the industry or other so-called softer indicators could again be reduced.
However, there are only a few decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, died of cancer, starts his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and she was popular and karismatic face in the gaming field.
For example, Iwata responded to the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwata footprints, evaluates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to take Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but it does not eat the company's bread on the side of the traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that hundreds of children who have arrived are missing annually.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported that hundreds of minor applicants will disappear annually.
The Superintendent Juha Kannelmaa of the Immigration Agency tells us what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappeared "under the country" annually?- A total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in 2013.
They disappeared nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made to 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The background to the disappearance may be the fact that the case shows that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be a full-year-old person there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing people will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland in total, of which 134 were decided to expire because they were likely to have moved out of Finland, so adults were disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is there a number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 minor asylum applications on our own.
Total statistics on missing minors this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons too, he emphasises.
What's going on with those who have received a translation decision?
Will they also be lost, for example, in the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the implementation of the translation decisions is responsible for the police, Kantelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registrants.
He has taken action on this issue.
On Monday, the Orpo, who had considered refugee issues at the EU Council of Ministers, reported on practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
Due to the sickness crises, the equipment used for television and radio production by Timo T.A., a media careerr who lost his working capacity, is now on the market.
Mikkosen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment in Huuto.net, which was the most advanced tools in her industry.
The first news on the online announcement was the online magazine of the Iltamakasi.
Today, most of the equipment has remained on the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer described.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there are interested people.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but they are also needed for as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbies - collectors and designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks about the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from the current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the goods with us at all.
I've started to invene and see what goods are being handed over.
Now I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio equipment.
It is clear that a man who made a long career is not going back to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkose's real life work was already archived in summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited to collect box store films and other material from Myrsky.
The traffic threatens to timber after worse thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams will decide today whether they will expand power in relation to Friday’s mindlight.
The original plan was to set up the metro and tram transport only for the time of the expression of mind to be held on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will determine if the traffic stops for the whole day.
The chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
The surgeries of nights and nights and nights are aggravating drivers, so government plans to cut the lices raise resistance.
Hirvonen thinks, however, that it is a kind of dilemma to deploy traffic throughout the day.
If the metro and trams stand for Friday, public transport is virtually completely stopped in the capital region.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between morning six and nighttime on Friday.
On Friday, we don't move near and long distance.
The trains that leave before morning six are driven to destinations.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain in the cockpit.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 to 3 p.m. Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by the superiors, the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that the HSL can't say exactly which bus rentals will run on Friday.
Employee organisations will organise a great demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Tower on Friday at 11 a.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian and Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought the odds watch was a bomb.
In the United States, in Texas, the 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher held the clock that he brought to his school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his electronic exercise on the output.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were invited, and the situation ended with the kid being taken in handcuffs to a youth detention cell.
At no point has Mohamed been said to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a lie bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police's custody, but it consisted of a circuit plate and a digital display between which there were leads.
The case occurred last Monday, and Mohamed was punished by three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is angry about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country wonders whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Great Britain - Labour Director refused to sing national songs
In the song God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism made by the press on the right has also joined the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has infringed the people, I think the Labour Representative Kate Green in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday’s commemorative event, the fight against the German Luftwaffe was respected by British air forces in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and stresses his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in huge gratitude for the heroicity of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood honorablely silent during the national song, emphasised in the statement.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the labour line.
There are, in particular, people among the people who fear that he will expel moderate voters with radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the cessation of savings and the increase in public spending.
Mr Corbyn will be present today for the first time as a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
In the weekly twitter Cameron hung Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister questioned on his own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota was still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a trial
South Lake Minnetonka police have investigated the family killing in Minnesota Greenwood shortly a week.
The five - spirit family was found dead in his home on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45th.
After first shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house in the short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millionnatalo and a successful company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood clots is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets on the social media website for nurses on AllNurses.com.
In 2014 in StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been made 50 purchase offers from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have many ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Success was shown, among other things, by the fact that Short’s family purchased an auxiliary house from Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the dream of a collector: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for eight cars.
Judgment in progress
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering a variety of prep courses, had challenged him to court because of comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, the Short's website had not been removed from any comments that discouraged pre-cursors, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Lasku Loiri offered cakes
In addition, the owner triangle was rewarded at the feed event with the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner Prize.
This is great, Loiri comments on his tribute.
Celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned EUR 100,000 with his win.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the Grand Competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
The successful horse coach Korpi, according to Loir, gets full work peace in working with the horse.
The bucket determines and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri sucked.
The great gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens Superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children Hospital.
According to the hospital press release, this is an individual donation to charity in Canada by the largest athlete of all ages.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with the Canadiens eight years ago and $72 million worth.
So Subban’s donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives his name in the hospital.
Canadians’ players have already helped local hospitals significantly.
A year ago, long - term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s major hospital to get the PET scanner required for cancer studies to the hospital.
At the Japanese café you can order a wife for tonight, serves food only with bikini and a spoon on your head
The tea bars are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat coat, chicken coat, vampire coat, catfish and now a wife coat.
It strikes lonely, painful and hungry.
It's news from Metro.
From the Tokyoan Ore no Yome café (my wife) you can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress who pretends to be the spouse of a client.
"Boliso" is selected from the list before entering the cafeteria and he prepares and serves the food.

The website offers all the information about the length and weight of the math they prefer to sleep on.
Almost 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: they started to be equipped with anti-auto security attacks
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as reported in Intel's newsletter.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The Company will continue to update the report on the basis of the findings of the ASRB.
The International ICT Research and Consulting Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road.
The same estimate suggests that 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
The ASRB enables Intel to establish best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is an important ingredient in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, making the ASRB board a right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays around EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Ford Focus RS has been expected to rise for years.
Finally, the car begins to be in the sights of Finland.
Ford has published RS information now that the car world looks at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford's new four-speed RS accelerates with a 2,3-litre, 350-powered engine of 4,7 seconds from zero to 100 and its peak speed is 266 km per hour.
There is also an interesting price in Finland, which is initially estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it is announced.
Favorite Mark Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt car exhibition - such is the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, more important than the two new ones are certainly the new fourth generation of Sportage, where Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever-increasing street axle market.
The new European design director, created by Gregory Guillaume, Sportage, is more circular.
Axis intervals and external measurements have come a cent to the other here and the car breaks air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but it has been added to 177 horsepower-developing 1,6-litre turbo.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We still have to wait a little, because we will have a new Sportage coming in the spring of 2016.
Already before the year's change, the new Kia Optimat came to our country.
Suddenly, the new one doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher level equipment.
Initially, optimise with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when they arrive with a 2.0-litre turbo engine equipped with Optima GT.
At the same time, with its arrival, the sale of the Optima farm starts.
Chisu came back to the scenes, exploded in a brave sleeve suit.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a transparent, open necklace in the electric pants.
The costume is a beautiful presentation of the waist of the singer star.
The whole thing is crowned with a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During three years of break, a mother’s singer has been given birth plates with light exercise and yoga.
Chisun's daughter will soon fill the year.
The singer published his first single album from a new album in August.
After a long break, I am not really excited to get back to the scenes and to get to the public.
I've missed everything to do with music, says the singer.
In a couple of weeks Chisu will publish his new and at the same time fourth album called Polaris.
The new situation in life has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, wondering if people find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's mother style is amazed again.
Real TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the subjects of speech one by one.
He presents his pregnancy abdomen and breast equipment in sexy clothes, last night at one time in America, when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian with husband Kanye West from the show.
The black maternity dress is transparent in front of the breasts.
It reveals the skin-coloured chest straps underneath the dress in the flashlight.
The last time Kardashian dressed himself with an amateur maternity costume when she visited her friend at dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The costume was highlighted by the black over-generation keys.
The third special maternity dress is just as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation shift had its abdomen.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths of a model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from nowhere.
Although in the previous season you would have posed in top designers' costumes, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the industry, which compete for work with conkars.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go a year in such a way that there is a hotel room or an apartment in which fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If your mother is very young and cannot travel with her, loneliness can be intolerant.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are all the more stressful.
There's not just one kind of magnificence.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Going to work is always a risk game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are constantly together, and at the same time operate as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is tricky.
Models want to do so because of the opportunities it offers, but they are disguised by the fact that everyone thinks that the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel they're actors with some role.
But in the work of the model you can also express yourself.
You modeled the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently spending fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year's modeling.
Roope Salminen, a styled musician, presents the most unknown musician in the movie
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founder of the band in a film based on the Apulanta group in the early years.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but divorced in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a rap artist who's almost 26 years old, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar, Salminen laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Antti before I got a picture, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown for people in that crowd, so I think it's very good that I'm just learning his playstyle from video.
I don't want to imitate a person.
The man who's playing the Roope Salminen and the Dogs group doesn't play a role.
The punk manaeers come from the man's nature.
Stars, Stars, in the punk period, many certainly saw the presmake, as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been a small seed, but we always go full.
The main actors of the film were published today, led by Tuukka Temose, who played bass in 1993-2004.
The band’s acquainted nucleic crowds present to the vast audience still quite unknown young actors.
Rumpali Sipe Santa Claus presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Hostasta Tatu Sinisalo founded by Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint on his future peste last night, when he told Snapchat mysteriously to prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new look, which he has had to implement for the movie.
Roope, previously seen in the fish and the chin beard, has driven his face into silococks, and colored his brown hair into black.
Psychology advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or do you want to tell me about it at all?
This is not a matter of force, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not let them look at the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and afflict, he says.
However, if the child has encountered television news images of refugees or has heard about them elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to discuss the starting points of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s fears may be surprising.
They may not be those that the parent thinks he's afraid.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared of yourself.
A smaller child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves remain peaceful during the conversation, the child will also experience being safe.
Greater children are likely to encounter a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them if they think about a child.
The fact is that not all people in the world have things well.
Parents can, together with children, consider how we are dealing with this in our family.
But is the world, in the end, a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also speaks of difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with future difficulties in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

Your own forces at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalaland that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola made the Apilan Pallosalama sweep to the attack in the middle of the summer.
It only ravaged the profits and the second ranks until the end of July the Tampere raves collapsed.
As the ori was bogged down, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered for his protective period from a veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was cleared in the swing.
The horse had a throat headitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it required two drug cubes to cure it.
As Apila's Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, North Nordic states that he was positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time after the second SE tamma Taruntu.
Apila's Pallosalama was under severe pressure when it had been able to drive normally only a few weeks.
In view of these things, the small inclination at the end was understandable, says the Nordic.
The coach assumes that the fair competition made the Ori steel.
The horse's instigation certainly went forward, and hopefully it would also have been balanced.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When it hasn't been fun, it could have thrown fat without any sickness.
Instead, on a good day, the Ori has removed such a lightning that the opponents have been wondered.
At the speed of the day, competitors can't handle Pallosalama, from which even warmblooded rides can be removed.
In Vermo, there is a peach run in the north.
But the different thing is how Apila's Pallosalama agrees.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it might even be stuck under the car's tree and so on.
I hope the Ori would be more calm than when Turku left.
Apila's Pallosalama will be able to come out of the bowl as well, and we will drive it out of the win, the coach promises.
That's why you can't get rid of the useless iPhone programs
The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple may intend to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook, CEO of the company in the interview with Tim Cook Buzzfeed.
The Apple iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newskioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips.
The most recent addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a compelling update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple Intelligent Watch owners.
According to Cook, deletion of Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company does not want to waste memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat today reported.
Price increases attracted downwards by low energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a slightly downward estimate of 0.2% in a couple of weeks ago.
In July the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
In the EU of 28 countries, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose by 1.4% from the euro countries most.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest in the fall of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area is still steadily far from the target of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is the rate of rise of 2% in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts on average 0.1% inflation for the euro area for this year.
Next year the increase will rise to 1.1 per cent, the central bank anticipates its publication in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
United States Fed is trying to extort monetary policy
The next downturn in the United States will begin at the fastest rate in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed will start again for a long time to raise its interest rates.
And the financial markets, in turn, start down before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he might start interest purchases this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
The next recession can therefore be pushed on at the fastest by next autumn and as the financial market rate rhythm before it.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they have always done, and if they react to the extortion of Fed's money wings as they have done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the Deutsche Bank in London’s market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle studies.
The Bank distributed a long-term Asset Return Study report on over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The research and report strategies do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterward.
On the other hand, they present economic statistics with the evidence and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously acted at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at the key variables in the economy and in the financial markets that are now on the same or another model than at the time of previous interest rates - and what could be the result of that.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a faster state to sustain the rise in interest rates than ever since the 1950s.
To the beginning of the recession, maybe not a year.
Fedi's monetary policy and its respective stimulus, the leaders have been suggesting over the last summer and the beginning of the autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate for more than nine years can take place this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Executive Board meets to decide at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed Fund guidance interest in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but at the same time minor 0.25 percentage points of interest ended for just two years, with Fed raising interest from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The symptom of the financial markets began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later, the financial crisis collapsed to a worldwide nightmare on the Judgment Day.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy imbalances began slower than typically since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were then harder and harder than ever since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche Strategies have screened the rises and declinings of the world's largest economies, as well as the turns of the financial markets since 1950 and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact will be clear since the 1950s.
As a result of the first interest rate purchase, the period has been less than a year, mostly less than three years and more than three and a half years on average.
The rate rise in the financial markets has ended over the period of two years following the start of Fed’s interest rates.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its control rate by ten different cycles.
Each time has differed from one part, and there is a relatively limited number of cases in consideration, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certain effect of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The key reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be found unquestionably even through decades of research.
But for three reasons which led to the crisis and raised its destructive power, it must be somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks in the world considered their control interest rates too long.
They found the traces of the bubble, and at the same time raised the next one.
2) Over the past decade, the amount of debt, which has accumulated in the various parts of the financial and real economy, and which has already been too high, has increased by the impact of monetary policy on central banks' surpluses.
Born the largest indebtedness in economic history.
3) In particular, the insane financing of the financial sector, which has been packed with almost the holdings of the financial economy, led to the most significant exchange rates in the financial market for the past from shares to real estate, debt securities and assets.
There is hardly any serious dispute about the fact that, in the face of more and more complex debt bonds, the financial markets increased to higher levels were rarely dangerous and unstable, since the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures of debt rows may not have lasted until their time after interest payments had started and the cost of debt financing had changed to the rise.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, which resulted in a major downturn.
Larger bubble and more debt
German strategies do not know what is going to happen next, but give the topic of the windmill by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) Debt has for a long time not been insane as ten years ago, but now the cheapest debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Therefore, the financial and real-economic debt burden is not reduced, but now, in the various parts of the economy, the debt burden is steadily higher than before or before the financial crisis.
(3) Liquidity from the former and cheaper central banks has remained largely on the financial markets and has reduced key securities and asset types to the most expensive since the peak prior to the financial crisis or at any time.
They also note that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but, in this respect, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are disproportionately higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten its money flows.
Perhaps the French bank of Societe Generale's strategy's image of Albert Edwards' future is not as strange as its sudden effect can be.
He has for good time trained the Bank's international investor clients in the following full translations of Fed:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon, it's time for Fed to turn out the financial bricks with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who manufactures computers and printers intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed to HP's business service party, says the company.
In November, HP will be distributed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and to the PCs and printers focused on HP Inc..
HP’s staff was the largest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is deducted from 25,000-30000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers are accountable for more than 10 per cent of its business performance.
In another year, its three most important customers brought 65 per cent of their business performance.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system for iPhone after the update of Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking on "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone lets the option download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when the display has shown a "Software Update Failed" error message.
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion or try to update through the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include deletion of applications to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that proposes deletionable applications and then reinstalls them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the update so that the battery doesn't end.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery ends in the middle, it can lead to the update rigorous.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax parish company
According to Yle, the Minister for Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the government of the tax parish company.
According to Ylen, the company's business involves so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed as a member of the government Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself said he had left a notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it, and that's enough for me to leave the notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place in the agreed timetable, says Berner in the interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The property of the Swedish Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia-Upoflor government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs government as well as in the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, Kährs' property in Luxembourg passes through the multi-step property structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted membership of the government in the Luxembourg company Kährs' second largest owner's request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia-Upofloor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was applied for to the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to ensure the realisation of the interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital gains are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's property in the company has no tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure established in the tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' capital fund, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company for ownership.
In Espoo, a reception centre run by the company opens
In Espoon Otaniem, the first reception centre maintained by the company will be opened to adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 people from tonight.
The number of places may increase within a week to up to 300 to 400 people.
The Immigration Agency shall set up the reception centre in the property of the former Civil Protection Institute.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is in particular the production of healthcare and healthcare services.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative worker extortion package
The STTK is starting to prepare an alternative package for the extortion of the labour market of the government.
The organisation also hopes that other salaried central organisations.
According to President Palola, the attention is at present in the speech on Friday.
Alternative ways of lowering the labour price will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization's government meeting at a break to journalists.
On the other hand, Palola believes that the Central Trade Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The STTK’s economics have calculated that the change security provided by the government’s competitiveness package is estimated to be EUR 30 million to the employer, while the other side of the package is 2,700 million.
I don't know if it's a lot of enthusiasm to have a conversation if you have one relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has wished for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is expected to give a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola didn't take a position as to whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
According to Palola, the operation of Sundays is a painful place for STTK's field.
The organisation requires that the government withdraw from mandatory legislation to implement part of the blackouts.
According to Palola, the STTK does not encourage the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to object to the labour market stimulus package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, among other things, the wages for the first days of illness are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have called on employees to express their minds and did not intend to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder praises
The Akva President, Sture Fjäder, thanks the STTK for preparing the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming on the same lines with Ahava, as a longer-term alternative model for government presentations has already been developed in Ahava.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, President of the Akava, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the proposal for cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he would prepare new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava informed that it has been preparing for a long time for its own proposal, which it is ready to negotiate the 5 % increase in competitiveness of the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and for a long time we have written an alternative model for the government's proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akva lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without GER, the package is not strong enough.
We are preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau of the AKA will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, joint coal, talkoes" - play bingo while talking to Sipilä tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva's green left-hand bingo coupon at Tampere University for tonight.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Möntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for a previous speech by the Prime Minister, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in holding a famous radio speech that meant the beginning of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
The President and ministers then held a number of radio speeches during the winter and subsequent war.
In the 1990s Esko Aho held a new year speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremonial.
In the autumn of 1976 President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike by train operators with a television speech.
Simply speaking, monarchist talks
The speech of Sipila has raised criticism and thoughts about what is going to happen.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, said that "Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the private conversation has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Judge condemned Facebook that "monarchist thinking: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipila's dialogue: "Approximately six months from the elections.
There is no single appearance of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is the fear of @juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Office of the Council of State, the speech of Sipila has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented directly on by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
It has been criticized for presenting Sipila's speech.
We considered the matter and found that the public service task is to promote a comprehensive publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
Like We at the time of Tammels
The speech has also raised anxiety.
When evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be bitter and dressed their best.
My mom's gonna put on a beautiful piece and my dad's putting a tie on his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., you shut up at TV as you used to be at the time of Me Tammeloids," writes blogger Saku Timone.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also telling in his speech why the Finnish government sits in tax parishes with millions of millions hiding its capital, which make law of mercy for other tax evacuators and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the money is out of the state?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
On what Sipilä says, one guess is to present the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It's published a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the living of debts and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal on the exclusion of Al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have given up, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Axis Island, the Russian United Nations ambassador proposed a plan that, after some time, al-Assad would have left power elegantly.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they thought al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Axis Island, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three plans in the bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to have weapons, the opposition and Al-Assad had to get contact immediately, and the abandonment of Al-Assad's power had to be implemented reluctantly.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily agree on all the issues, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the interview with Guardian.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has communicated the message from the Czech Republic to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tchurk did not confirm the content of the debate for the newspaper, but according to the Ahti Island, there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations of the Ahtisaari, but said that the Al-Assad troops had already committed several massacres at that time and the key opposition groups refused any agreement that he would have left to power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the UK Middle East Department, is reluctant to address Ahtisaari's speeches because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss Al-Assad's destiny.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in the Axis claim is that the Czech Republic spoke with the Moscow authority.
If he had told me about the speeches of Churkin, I would have said that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have suspected that it was Putin's cock to hold power with an al-Assad supporter.
A refugee flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on the Axis Island, about 7,500 people died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to escape from their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is what we have done.
I see no other option than to take good care of these rusty people.
Now we pay the bill we made ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Centre for the organisation of asylum seekers at the drill of the Tower
The Agency for the Organisation of Asylum Applicants, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in the Tower.
The centre would be set up in an empty building in the centre of the city, in the building of the Tower.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki Sanomat newsed that the delegation had already decided to present the school building as a temporary solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Vice President of the City Council of Tornio, this is not true.
When the entire delegation was not together and some of the team wanted to have a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation to the next Monday to decide, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
The Centre opposed 13 delegates.
Based on this, you could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to the city leader Timo Nousiaise, the city was contacted on Monday, and it was reacted quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time would be able to join together.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred metres from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still hopes for alternatives to extortion from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central), halving the holiday money in public would only take care of a part of the price of the work sought by the government.
However, the government will gladly accept an alternative package if the social partners succeed in reaching an agreement.
In the Parliament, Sipilä told the journalists that he had not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for substitutes for the extortion of working life reported by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly welcome it as part of the whole package.
In Sipila’s view, halving the holiday money would be a means of doing so, because it would affect almost all the employees, unlike the government’s plans to cut Sundays.
Labour market organisations could agree on the reduction of holiday money because they have been registered in collective agreements instead of in law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will tell the Parliament about the extortion of working life in a communication by the Council of State.
According to Sipila, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This isn't the final rear limit, either.
The legislative work will then move, i.e. the train is moving, and it will become more difficult.
It's a good time now.
It won't take long for such things if there's a will, Sipilä has made it.
The list published last week by the government includes the transformation of the final and helators into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the wages for the first sickness days will be reduced, overtime allowances halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation, which has led to strong criticism.
In view of the activities, the salaried central organisations will organise a great demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi's delegation approved the extension of Mahahall's warehouse
The Tohmajärvi delegation unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy's control, or Mahalahall's warehouse.
It was the judgement that the project was larger and more expensive than originally was talked.
The busy schedule was also tight.
It was also somewhat wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous enlargement was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400 to 450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the money will be decided in the subsequent part-year report.
Another item on the agenda was the investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk in the municipality, because the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Vämmistö (ps.) justified.
The language of Karelia also stands in Joensu
The City Government reduced its previous strong position to bring karelian street signs to the centre of Joensu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the choice of a livestock tradition in the whole province.
Joensuu does not declare itself a capital of the language of the karel because it has no historical grounds and the language of the karel is a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the river River has been more part of the eastern savolage.
Even after the new decision, there will be no carnival street signs in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is well prepared, on a case-by-case basis, for use in the livestock language, for example, in the information tables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same approach to the city is recommended for all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, it is also worth taking a generous view of the karel language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Carolina as well.
The language of Karelia is still characteristic of the province, as is the picture of Joensuu as a forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used for the multi-purpose marketing of the province.
The termination of train connections reduces the province’s vitality
The cuts of train connections strike the province's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the province's business and competitiveness.
And it affects whether you can live and work here at all, Kari Karjalainen, the city director of Joensuu, wonders.
He also raises the question of air transport, which has also been continued several times in the report.
For the whole province, it is important that we do not manage to reduce our opportunities by state measures, as is going on.
We should look at the impact of these stopping connections on employment, for example, the Karian emphasises.
The worsening of travel connections creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services are here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland, says.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research purposes.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market a university towards Western Finland, because the intersectional connections are weak.
At the moment about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
Approximately 10-20% of them are from Newland, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Flood became one of my sorrows for the war of You
The view of the City Board of Joensuu on the provincial Siun War project seems to be unanimous, but one of my sorans is.
Mr Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Council, presented the abandonment of the entire project at the government meeting on Monday, but his presentation was unfavourable.
The Board approved the draft decision by the City Director Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Cotka Kouvola ends next year
Passenger transport from Eagle to Kouvola will remain in the future, even if one train shift is less than one.
Passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola will be subject to changes next March.
One train dock is left, but still five times a day you can get from Cot to Kouvola and vice versa.
These agreements are due to State savings.
Purchasing fees for the next four-year period of the Ministry of Transport and Communications will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one didn't get down, the guys flew out of the place.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climbing from the climbing roof, who couldn't get down from the roof with his own help.
The situation was created in the Tower Mountain at Ketotie at half six a.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no stitches to the roof at all.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb on the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one of them didn't.
As a result, the rest of the world flew away and the passers alerted the rescue facility to help the last one safely rest on the roof back to the surface of the earth.
FedEx's business profit double, decreasing the 2016 fiscal year's outlook
FedEx reports depressing results from the last quarter of the year, and the delivery dump cut its performance forecast throughout the year, resulting in reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for vacations.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for vacations.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects to end next May with the result of a tax year of $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were waiting for $10.84, reported in FactSet's survey.
Despite the average 4.9 per cent price increases coming into force on 4 January, and the higher additional charges for land transport of heavy or large packages started in November.
The company said that it expects business profits to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trade is growing.
The President and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company "will be consistent with the expected weaker economic conditions, particularly in production and global trade."
Plans for wages for holidays were published on the day after the competitor UPS told that he intends to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ended on August 31, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
Winning per share came $2.42, which remains from the average forecast of $2.44. The 12 analyst survey was carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5% to $12,3 billion.
On Zack's question, six analysts were expecting $12,23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transport, which has stopped the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the increase in online trade has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, turnover of the country unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the operations were, in principle, the same due to the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while the profits of freight were higher in terms of labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx's shares decreased at $3.85, or 2.5 per cent to $1150.15.
FedEx closed the record on Tuesday 11 per cent for this year and 17 per cent under June 11.
The Presidents of the U.S. Central Bank will sit around the huge stomach table this week for two days at the long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the tax rate for the first time to almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder of the fact that the president of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The Congress has set the double responsibility on the part of the Central Bank: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after the great depression, the heads of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the data show that the economy is growing firmly, the recent collapse in the global financial markets may have made already precautionary central bank officials more scared in terms of increasing instability.
"Employment and inflation are understandably the first and most important elements to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, Stifel Nicolaus & Co's major economic expert.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a right to restart interest rates, the increased uncertainty on the world market is a sufficient reason to wait yet," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been agreed, which is also a source of nervousness in the economy.
According to Bloomberg's recent study, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
However, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the increase, as, according to the key indicator, the possibility of growth is only about 30 per cent.
This refers to the declining of the securities markets if the central bank raises the level unless the decision-makers succeed in softening the attack by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose to 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with the new chapter 16.599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, the senior financial expert of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they have to make a lot of effort in their direction to support the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would calm down the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about the time the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that this month the central bank would raise interest rates by a quarterly percentage point, taking the first small step towards the slow tightening of the financial situation, which would ensure the US recovery.
In spring and early summer, Yellen has said that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
In the past month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level considered by the Central Bank as a limit to full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of increased growth.
Although inflation is still below the 2% annual target of the Central Bank, the decision-makers of the Central Bank say that access to this will have the temporary impact of the lower price of oil.
The economy "solves the higher interest rates and also needs them, taking into account the strict situation on the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, the chief economic expert of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 per cent of its May record, when investors feared that the slowing economy in China would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the May peak.
For the central bank's decision-makers, the market downturn is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us because the interest rate should be increased.
"Without these events on the financial markets and recent weeks' news on the weak Chinese economy, the decision-makers would press the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, special researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decisionmakers are waiting for at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
" Possible effects on the US economy are still quite unclear and they have little information on the consequences of the Chinese events," Oliner says.
International economic well-being is not the main concern of the Central Bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, then president, suggested that the central bank could "reduce" the increase in the amount of money, caused changes in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies have become increasingly blurred together, the central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc's global strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the state of Virginia, noted this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to the financial market movement which has seemed to be separated from the basic economic factors."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest, and Lacker, a member of the Committee's voting rights, is an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "without its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," says Lacker.
A year later, the Central Bank canceled these operations.
The Central Bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England’s Board of Interest.
The latest milling will not be near its level, says Posen.
"No one wants to face a situation where interest raising is feared because the market is disturbed," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds two different requirements and does not mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Children's Disease Organisation in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Children's Disease Organization SPRS has developed a shokeing way to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies in breasts with painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutritions to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need additional energy, so they are advised to increase their daily amount of calories with about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that increasing the amount of calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
Recent research led by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine, Robert Waterland, revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumour.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet has been found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is the favourite viewer, despite Nine Channel's attempts to news about the leader detection in today's show
Karl Stefanovic’s and Lisa Wilkinson’s raid to Canberra to news about the subsequent mentions of the Liberal Party’s leader’s revelation failed to add today’s audiences.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull pulled Tony Abbott out of power.
The competitive program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was trapped in London as part of its weekly series of international broadcasts, covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The median load did not seem to affect Australian TV viewers, as the average viewer of Sunrise in five state capitals was 397,000, compared with today's figure 339,000.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise, 330,000.
At the beginning of the year the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September the Sunrise average is 349,000 viewers, with today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The winds are blowing out this morning elsewhere than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news of the Seven Channel was the 800 Word Series, where the former Star Erik Thomson of the Packed to the Rafters series appears, an amazing first performance.
A new series of dramas, which collected a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, relates to a recent widow who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have been wondering if Thomson's popular series is a single force without Rebecca Gibney, the star of Rafters.
Last night's results gave him real certainty.
The Seven Channel The X Factor program was strong with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the The Block series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
The second night of the The Chase Australia series, there was a two-way destiny on the Seven Canal.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half-hour of the new visa program (17-17.30) collected 446,000 average viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) raised 623 000 viewers - which was enough to win from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night The Chase Australia's first half-hour average viewer value was 520 000 and the second half-hour number was dizzy 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night average viewer drop gives the Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce McGuire's audiences.

The final triangle agrees with fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won the Bachelor series.
Her identity has been kept extremely secret with Sam Wood at the Bachelor.
There are three girls left left. They really don't help who got the last rose.
However, when we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before the three became two, they could, however, inadvertently give a hint on the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were thrown into poetry when they told us how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness for why they would like to be his partner.
But when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go?", their answers could offer a revelation about who won the heart of the boy.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies (Sarah) and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind for the whole series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really close to earth, with him it's fun to be," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxing together.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the real one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now in this whole heart," he said.
When he asked who Wood should choose if he didn't, Mackay was a mystery.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be posted on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have also asked about him after his impressive open day of practice at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne's replacement bench for the final game after how this Australian rugby raid dropped the ball in his first flight hit back when winning Minnesota on Tuesday, reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight hit and took her to the race game after Reggie Bush got hurt.
The real nature of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of putting his new entrant in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49ers Special Journalist Cam Inman reported that Haynea also encouraged special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the lost ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a flight shot by Minnesota Vikings in the first game quarter
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished a man for the NFL debyte.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio couples division Hamish & Andy at the frequency of the 2DayFM channel 104.1 that he would not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was now just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her acidification to her 2007 Origin debyte when the feed in her own area of goal led to Queensland's goal.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game Hayne posed his Instagram account in a photo with fans holding Australian ticket.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested on a weapon threatening the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 died when the police fired against demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old boy, died in southern Nepal after the police shot in a crowd of rubber bullets, who showed their opinion against the new Constitutional proposal of the country, the Authority reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the area of Rupandeh, about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior official in the region, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw rocks and firearms.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before using rubber missiles.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In the recent weeks of violent demonstrations in the south of Nepal, the members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution will undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus group demands its own country.
After the 10th day of August, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, 11 of whom have been police.
At that time, four main parties signed the agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the Constitutional Code clauses in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could have been adopted by Sunday.
NHC states that the US National Hurricane Centre, south of Cape Verde, has a 60% chance of a spinning storm
On the broad low pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, there is a 60% chance to develop into a tropical roundstorm over the next 48 hours, said the United States National Hurricane Centre on Tuesday.
The second line of low pressure, located in the middle of the Cape Verde island group and the Small Antilles, has a 60% chance to become a tropical storm over the next two days, Miami's weather forecast centre added.
Google starts a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations who help thousands of refugees come to Europe as they flee from the riots of war and the poorest countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal view of it when it published a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by the director, from his personal experience, Google's employee Rita Masoud, who fled with his family at the age of seven, wrote from Kabul.
"Let us go with numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperately trying to help.
Donations receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and the United Nations Senior Commissioner for Refugee Affairs.
Google told me that it corresponds to each donation made worldwide on the google.com/refugeerelief website up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War has been taking place, mainly because of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Decrease surgery can help mildly excessively heavy diabetes
According to the new study, the benefits of a reduction in diabetes of type 2 slightly overweight may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly excessive diabetics live longer after a depletion surgery than those treated in other ways than by surgery.
"Recovering mortality data lasts a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is an abdominal surgery expert who wrote a chapter on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
In abdominal surgery, a variety of methods are used to reduce the size of the abdomen.
They reduce famine and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have been sickly fat and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the weight ratio to the length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is over 30, he is considered to be excessive fat.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatrian surgery, abdominal transient surgery, and abdominal reduction, with type 2 diabetes medicinal treatments in people who were mildly overweight.
The study showed a decrease in the average BMI of the subjects cut from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those treated by other means than surgery remained largely the same in 29.
Of the subjects who were cut, 36% of the patients had a full healing effect and 28% of the patients had a partial healing effect.
Because of the comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes was fully healed by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL kolesterol " were generally better in the surgery group", the authors said.
Studies also monitored blood haemoglobin A1c levels reflecting long-term blood sugar levels.
The haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the A1c haemoglobin decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the drug therapy group it remained stable at approximately 8%.
However, this better "glycaemic control" described by the improved haemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years," says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, compared with the abdominal reduction group, the abdominal transition group had decreased more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased its weight index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1% and 2.1%), and had more likely to achieve a complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizonan College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to a longer life in more heavy people.
The Swedish study found that overdose of abatement surgery had a lower probability of 29 per cent of death over 15 years compared with a group of more traditional treatments.
Although a new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The research results are crucial precisely in the fact that they demonstrate that surgery is safe for the lower weight index group", he says, "not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at a time when the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for excess acidity and diabetes, it is very difficult to withdraw the situation.
"Everything can't come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees by adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in refugees' home countries.
Dalai Lama dealt with the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
Dalai Lama argued that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be placed ahead of individual nations or even parts of earth.
He also stressed that although the response to the refugee crisis must be admired by the Western European countries, it is also insufficient.
"Everyone can't come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
Power use has never solved these problems," he added.
When taking a stand on the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States led to severe events in the chain.
"After the 9/11 hit, in a letter I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the swallowing of the hand disinfectant in children has increased to four times
In the United States, toxicity data centres have reported a sharp increase of nearly 400 per cent in the swallowing of an alcoholic hand disinfectant for children under 12 years of age since 2010, reports the Georgian toxicity data centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgian Drug Information Centre, the cases of disinfectant swallowing reported to the poisoning data centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will be subject to emergency services," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children are drinking disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a low-cost increase.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic oral water to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant smells of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those that have been added to the smell.
There are strawberries, grapes and oranges that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant may contain alcohol between 45 and 95%.
Especially in small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," said Stephen Thornton, the head of the Health Care Centre at the University of Kansas, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey shot on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who some time ago swallowed only four injections of strawberries in hand disinfectant at school, and was taken to the emergency care.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of adult drunkenness, reports Chris Ritchey, a medical emergency clinician, who took care of a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
When Nhaijah was talking, he couldn't walk when he arrived in the emergency.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate child hospital in case of possible symptoms of brain injury, because alcohol caused the girl to fall and beat her head, Ritchey told.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been killing my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfecting towels and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol absorption, some disinfectants have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three four-year-olds planned to poison their "vicious" teachers by spreading bacterial pulses into the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand disinfectant and forbids it from its class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a "music hug" and leave discipline to the school district.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no conflicts
Griffiths deducts speeches about Celtic's conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but he makes it turn
Hearts fights the Scottish Football League for charges against Neilson, and Warburton is guarded for recruitments in January that may interfere with the unity of the team.
Dons raised his lead to Celtici at five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty shot Aberdeen into a narrow victory from Hamilton at the Pittodri Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to raise the difference to the Celtici at five points.
Griffiths reduces speeches about conflicts
There have been rumors about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under a closer eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch Comic Director.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of the Scottish championship is boring the Dutch - de Boer
The former midfield player of Rangers and former Dutch country team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they do not have a competition for the championship with Rangers.
The current ambassador of Ajax de Boer said, "In Holland, no longer shows the highlights of Celtic's games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't in.
People here can't just talk about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're interested in it.
These teams play a lot of tensions, and also non-Scotlanders want to follow those games.
Deila swears to turn around the situation
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn around.
Losing Malmö and the resulting drop in the Master League quickly followed loss by ten men playing Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series with the next five points.
Deila, however, said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We are, too, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves players' performance.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton watches for January player transfers
Although Rangers-boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible slots for January player transfers, he is cautious of the most recruiting ones, assuming that he does not want to confuse the team's unanimity.
The former boss of Brentford said, "The move window on January is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players in the summer, it is time to adapt all over, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes increasing unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest Michu suggests retreat
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtici in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and has not managed to find a new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football League because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third red card sentenced by Collumin over the last eight months, which was revoked.
Neilson remains behind his message, saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player had to be reproached when he had given his insulting song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in the pub in Edinburg, Roseburn, before the derby in Edinburg at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"The issue was derby and it was a moment's lead," the attacker said, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I move to the Celtic."
Tannadice government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership in the ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys all right again," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about the ugly victory in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve Adam Rooney's seventh consecutive league win, which raised them to the top of the table with five points above Celtici.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a pocalypse or a league that would not have won games like this."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the whole of the UK
EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained in 164 000 persons during the period from May to July, at the same time as unemployment in the whole of the UK rose by 10,000 people to a total of 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK 5.5%, according to the figures of the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people over a period of three months, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
In the course of the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent, which is higher than the UK average by 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish State Secretary, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The long-term government plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Britain.
In these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify to execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I'll see if a man is executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll sit at the watcher at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly syringe.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to be terrifying this day when it's approaching.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought that would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique viewpoint.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are chosen through an awful appreciation.
Oklahoma has reduced the media spaces to 12-15.
Anyone who chooses to see the event coolly.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created him through phone calls made during the months and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen to save what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoman reporter on Twitter accused me of being neutral.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story in the way he wants, and you'll be able to participate.
I picked the reporter.
He admitted that "he could have put his word better," but still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said it.
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to my series of podcasts.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him a guilty person.
But I think there is a very strong chance that he has not been guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And so this is the angle I see him die.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists here to take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die unnecessaryly.
The man was pulled out of the Canning River after the watery police hunt.
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he pulled a man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract the police from his hand went wrong when he found himself in low, mute water just a few meters away from the policeman who tried to "attirate him mildly back to the beach".
Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday because of an unauthorized intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
However, he did not get so far.
"He stood in the water saying, "I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to dye, so he used safer tactics: "a good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim over the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired locals to start the design of a playful Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims the journalists were trying to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria's journalists tried to infiltrate their spy in his deposits last year, and threaten to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the journalists and the Racing Victoria Division of Incorrectness, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatain for the treatment of the race day was the last nite.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's kept his tongue under control in relation to the spy claims for an and a half year, and he didn't want "it would look like jealousy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes it gets frustrated so much that everything gets loose at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk the head up, and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I shouldn't continue as a coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview on the racing.com site, where he told me that the Incorporacy Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"One and a half year ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man... when I asked him... and offered him work in my records if he provided information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, it's true that they should fire their lawyer, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to be manned and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than coaches for what is going on in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think that's what they think.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me off, and I do not doubt whether the things I have said now may make them think exactly that.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it's mourning me.
It really hurts me.
I urge them to make a decision which is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back to this.
The coach's frustration has increased with the long-term Lidar's cobalt study, and the late rejection made him find that he could "cast his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the training of the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the race day treatment rule for "silly" since the madness or rage has been placed on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees put it on his leg in a mistake.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it last night, as it was.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be confronted with a three-month ban on competition due to a race day for which the suppliers started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"All of us understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver responsible for escape in Cobram arrested
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic escape after hitting his biker this weekend in Cobram.
The biker was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he had severe injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me the driver drove away and stopped to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself reported to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
Cycling, 40-year-old man Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy of the Melbourne Storm team attacks competitors in the pressing meals
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL-rugby League championships that his team's taclams would be part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters Coach Trent Robinson said the divorce judges allowed Storm to "press" on his own side when it suddenly won the final bust in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett did hardly cover up his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night in the final cartoon. Bennett called the game a rugby bag "show window" and said that the two Queensland teams were not "heavy enthusiastic" pressures.
Bellamy defended his team's taclams and said they're just focusing on "contact" in the taclam.
Bellamy added that his confidence increased two leading coaches' criticism of Storm, because it means they're afraid of losing the team.
"This is always going to be talked about - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about pressing when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or technology all year round. Over the last six weeks, we've only been pressing on the contact in the stabs, and that has made us succeed.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not used to losing, and so this was a small shock for him.
It's funny how this is always talking about this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "naughty".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night games and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said that he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play such rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's a game you want to play when you have its types of players.
He brought it out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I will be more confident when they say such things, because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more score rich than played between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or is it an exciting violation of the defence line and not making a goal?
It's about lines for me.
If they mention us, that means we can play against them somewhere.
Storms will be free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game either against North Queensland cowboys or Cronu Sharks next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Warranties to a Serb man of $200 000 for drug charges
The man threatened with a lifetime of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released against a guarantee of $200,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police had tracked 100 pounds of drugs for the Solay hunt, who came to South America through Vanuatu and slaughtered in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was seen to meet other accused in the port all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic threatens the potential lifetime of a cocaine holding company intended for business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire amount of cocaine and that he may have been in the cafeteria for completely innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has close connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the law on Wednesday.
Maksimovic lied to the police about the place he lived in.
Maksimovic's mother and grandfather had jointly offered a guarantee of $200 000 to ensure his release.
"After reading the optional certificates of both people, it is clear that making a $200 000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted guarantees under the condition that he handed over his passport in Australia and Serbia, reported to the police daily, and held up his ban on night-to-morning outdoors.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract paedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her asleep on this phone and then logged in to the online communication service where Hogg received numerous undisputed pictures of children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl looked into her phone and found shocking messages, and then she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, investigated the computers on the spot and found "sorgful" web searches using the search words used to search for unrivalled pictures taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "sleep the paedophiles" on the internet before he "she pretended to be a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that it is a addiction that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had carried out a grave on a computer but said that they were done only because he wanted to pretend he was a police officer so that he could scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him pictures, as well as when Hogg asked him to send additional pictures.
Hogg said it was just for feeding purposes.
He said after he had been drunk, he was sick, and he wanted to watch pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she shouted to her mother, trembled and cried.
My mother saw the immortal pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, admitted his guilt for making or taking pictures of unacclaimed children on the 14th of June of last year. He broke his jacket on 25 January of this year and failed to come to court on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to be included in the register of sexual criminals, as it can be claimed that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the judgment until October so that the social action could have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he was arrested before the trial.
He was added to the record of sexual criminals before the date of the sentence.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe made a wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, the oldest leader in Africa, Mugabe, fell down at the stairs leading to the speaker rook.
He didn't get hurt, but the video of the crash was spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament's openings also stained in the opposition's legislators' claims that they had been sent to anonymous death threats, warning them from bugging Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they buzzed and interrupted him in the meantime when he held a speech to Parliament on the state of the country, which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the group discipline officer of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians received text messages in their mobile phones that warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number of which the message was sent does not answer, but the title of the message is 'Death'," Gonese told the journalists after the speech of Mugabe.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not be valid.
The group's overseer said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is " concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cut efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster growing business equipment and services activities.
The expected job cuts bring about $2.7 billion costs from the fourth quarter, said HP’s newsletter.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move to a new type of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it "will continue to produce non-comparable integrated technology solutions" for companies, says the company's newsletter.
The division is dismantled by a company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard from Stanford University in the 1930s to manufacture electrical equipment. The company operates in a garage located in Palo Alto, called "the place of birth of the Piilaakson".
HP has undergone a huge reorganisation to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the last sector based on the belief that strictly restricted companies are doing better.
Captain Mikel Arteta of the Arsenal says teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's match.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that now is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to the plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire misses at least four next England games, and taking into account his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The greatest pity in this last problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after the individual ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It doesn't have to do with his ankles or previous injuries that he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, when a player attempts to return through the middle there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in form.
The studies of Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has played in the last five seasons of Arsenal's 157 league games in only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal’s wider overall after the period 2007-08, in six of the eight periods, it has been one of the teams of the Valioliiga who have lost most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of the witch spirit, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement in disability statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from a disability can be exposed to a period when you need to strengthen your body and acquire a competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will be able to do the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Master League game against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, then playing Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerí and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably at the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give breathing rest to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear successor to the F section, the Maximimer Stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening Europe.
Nor has Dinamo lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Unwinning" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was thrown up by an earthquake, which was the strength of 3.2 Richter scales.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned last season about the surrender of the Master League to Monaco, and he is motivated by a still far-reaching dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us serious things about men's friendship
It is striking that there are no similar descriptions in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The company's problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, the possibility of healing was doubled if the percentage of their friends was "healthy" enough.
Similarly, in those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental health problems was halved if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media time of communication, the style passes by content and the immediate response is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
The values of this superficial success, which psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all this happens at the expense of internal values - internal desire for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of our mental health.
And, as the billionaire just explained, money really doesn't get any greater happiness.
The Frendie's finest thing was that it turned this phocus to its head.
One character did not define their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey's and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel... these humor came to realize that yes, men can get along with all this, even though they often hesitated to examine their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans organization explained to me: "When listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understood how smallest interaction with a friend can improve the feeling."
Often men contacting us experience that they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "passing over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that remembers when I try to offer longer-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although neutral, external position at the other end of my phone helps people in desperate moments, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're participating in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the pictures are redesigned for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk?
Or, what's even better if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendits will be sent to Comedy Central at the beginning, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest'
Di Maria makes a painting and helps PSG stick the side of Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates paintings against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria painted the Masters League in his debyte, helping PSG pass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below the game report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain started his Master League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö in the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the League of Masters in her debyte goal for less than four minutes, showing the French league champions the road, but the team lost several opportunities before finally increased its front distance in Cavan's hit by 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish Ligagaster, because the game had not only a continuation place, but also an improvement in their quarter-finals in the last three rounds
But even though PSG took the scores, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place in front of the goal and later was replaced from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at guests, so 2-0 win creates problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things that we're going to have to go on this season," Blanc said.
This is a good thing.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though we had not succeeded in making one or two more goals.
After the wound, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team with one of the three changes made after the team stayed in the 2-2-game Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he stayed in the shadow of Di Maria by four minutes.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentine attacker was named a man who took PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when running Marco Verratt's feed caught behind Malmö's defence line and then hit a beautiful finishing Johan Wiland over the back corner of the network.
However, if someone waited for an easy and big victory from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a stubborn opponent. It won Celtic in the final match when reaching this level, its opening field has nine international players and five-man defense and two players in the middle.
But the team did not offer anything else on the attack side than the shooting of Nikola Djurdjic in 34 minutes, which passed a button by Kevin Trappi's scoreboard.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost inputs and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, which failed in five companies in total only in the first half and then disappointed Cavani immediately at the beginning of the second half of Ibrahimovic.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working with his colleagues, and just after Ibrahimovic's feed, Di Maria sent a spin-off, which climbed Wiland's goalboard around 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally achieved after an hour of the game, thanks to the Cavan, the Uruguayan, the sixth of the season, after Ibrahimovic had pushed forward from the left of Maxwell's crusade.
It stopped Malmö's hopes to get back to the game, and only Wiland's great fight against the direct kick of David Luiz kept the final numbers down before the finish of Ezequiel Lavezz, which came from the exchange, was rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "The last game of our Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
I don't know. I don't know what to do.
I'll lift the hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, who suffered from the price reduction of basic goods, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its broad debt cut plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported that it had sold new shares for about GBP 1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of collapsed basic goods, when the slowdown in the Chinese economy burdens demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The new mark raised the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning stores.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its debt burden of $30 billion by about a third.
The company sold new equity with 125 penny shares, meaning a reduction of 2.4 per cent to Tuesday's decision price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares of a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
The long-term concern about China's continued growth has cut the prices of iron ore to about half, while at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other goods have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China’s president Xi Jinping will make a State visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed in the White House’s opinion published on Tuesday.
X's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to the last November visit of President Barack Obama to Beijing, said in the opinion.
The President of the United States and the spouse of the President Michelle Obama will arrange a dinner for X and this spouse for Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"Präsident X's visit gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China in a number of global, regional and bilateral matters of common interest, and at the same time it gives President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively issues of disagreement," added the opinion.
During a visit, which was first published in February, Xin is expected to depart from Seattle on his journey to Washington to meet numerous United States technology leaders before moving towards New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and X are expected to discuss numerous controversial issues, including Washington's concern about the alleged online espionage of China and the increased imperfection of the country in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon joined the African American filmmaker Effie Brown when they talked about a variety that Damon said is not needed behind the scenes.
In the Sunday evening of HBO's Project Greenlight episode, the actor interrupted Brown with the emphasis on the need for a variety of perspectives in terms of the manuscript selected for the project for a dark human main person.
"When we talk about a variety, it will be taken into account when selecting actors for the movie, not for the series," Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted unfaithfully, commenting "Oho! Wow. Okay," while the commentary of The Martian's actor remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series of finalists.
"I want to urge people to think about any director, then, how they treat Harmony's personal character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is a whore hit by his white coupler.
The Dear White People's producer insisted on the rights to conduct a film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon answered boldly that their direction "may end up giving us something we don't want".
When the debate was sent, the social media exploded to discourage Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger for the film poster, writing: "Matt Damon speaking on the only dark person in the room and explaining the difference to him is NOT WHITE that happens."
After its publication, the tweet collected more than 5,000 rewires and 4000 fans.
Damon's comments are at the moment when the precise racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the white police killed a teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter was spread across the globe and urged legislators and authorities to stop dysfunctional practices.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the Year's album candidates for the Grammy Award.
"Albumes are still important," he said.
Like books and black life, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion to answer the question of whether the group should be considered a group of hates by Fox News.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon was involved in the entertainment, producers and media mogules that were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the west.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Master crowned
The professional fan and bag collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete on Monday, who won the American Ninja Warrior competition and received the $1 million prize.
There has never been a competitor in the competition programme, which has just ended the seventh period, who would have survived all parts of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten first climbed and figured out the challenge in time, making him the first athlete of all the time who figured out American Ninja Warrior's tired fourth part. However, Caldiero figured out the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after the difficult victory and was still in shock for the winning of the $1 million main prize.
"I mean, it's great to think when I've never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big salary increase.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this is going to be... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed started to talk with The Hollywood Reporter about the fiancée and why Britten is not getting more prize money, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to cross the track.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one who has the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great prize and changes life, he gets a feeling of great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels awful about that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a real family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I'm happy that it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return for the eightth season, whose descriptions will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers slipped by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played their full role as a destroyer on Tuesday when it won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to get up to the half-pox from Houston Astros in a competition from another place of the American League wild card.
For Detroit the game was for at least one night returning to the six-lettered H-word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the last half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, regardless of how to get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Alfredo Simon, the Tigers feeder, continued his early attack when Detroit ran three times in the first two rounds, and then once in the sixth and another in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in a couple and let three runs.
This was only his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the switch to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
The Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and enabled two runs that were his first hits after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three hits night after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He threw the straw well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in beat exercises), looked much better at beat exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh pair, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Pentecost Byron Buxton started with a couple of shifts two times to the left line.
Right edge Aaron Hicks came home with one nest hitting, and Simon got directly burned by another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against whom he was set up, Miguel Sanoa, who was the first to start the run of two nests to the left of the right handed Drew VerHagen.
While two runners were on the field and then a flattered runner on the second base, VerHagen got the third base to beat Trevor Plouffe a double-playing finish.
This was the main series record: 27th time in this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received the 9th security run at the start of the 9th, Mauer crossed two hits of Tigers' closing against Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right handed player burned in three feeds I said in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust at the beginning.
Tigers got three runs in the first two rounds against the right handed veteran player who got out of the list of injured before the game after having been out of the game for more than a month due to the inflammation of the lower back.
"It's obvious that I didn't want such a start," Hughes said, "but when the game went on, it was more comfortable, and I felt that I got done with a third pair of nice inputs."
After Hughes caught the start-up hit at the first nest, he gave the second nest player Ian Kinsler to move on between one.
The walk of J.D. Martinez on the right side in the two fires brought Victor Martinez to the battleboard, who took himself to the first brush and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 tubes while the runners were in good runtime.
The third-boat player Nick Castellanos continued hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to move on to the third-boat.
Tigers continued with the second pair and got one fire, in the situation of two nests running a kidnapper from James McCann and two fires, in the situation of one nest running a centimeter from Anthony Gose, then the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feeding list and fed a runless third pair, then he replaced a right-handed prosecutor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted with three runs of six hits and walking with four fires.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right handed feeder of Tigers, was forced out of the shoulder of the throwing hand.
He was investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of wounded people since mid-August because of the shoulder twist, but he had to return on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is outside, the left handed feeder Daniel Norris comes from the list of the injured to start against Twins.
The Norwegian statistics in Tigers are 1-1 at four starts after the left handed feeder David Price was switched to him on July 30.
Norris has been outside since August 20 because of the right buffalo spine.
The series of Tigers and Twins three games ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is against Minnesota's right-hand feeder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open the economy to the world
The economy should help the outside world to promote growth,” President Xi Jinping told the Group on Tuesday, whose task is to guide the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to the deepening of the general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are pushing forward more new movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of restrictions on market access, the relaxation of border control principles, the call on state-owned companies to take private capital, and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and companies that cannot be invested will be established.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through experimental programmes.
This change is significant, as it gives a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, as stated in the opinion.
The government also weakens its control over the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies decide on how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors, more sectors are open to private investors.
"Management will not change its approach to foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the opinion stated.
In addition, the search process for permanent residents, "green cardia", will be facilitated by optimizing requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing lawyers' professional rights and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as the senior leaders Liu Yunsha and Zhang Gaoli, and was reported in the post-session opinion.
