The product cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Great and so it's no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be traced by you as a return.
I ordered a few days ago the #PRS_ORG#... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I think that is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another option of crediting?
I also believe that children should not be allowed to take a parental role for their little brothers and sisters.
However, I think it is also good for big sisters to take care of the little ones in size.
Just look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough child themselves, I see no problem.
If your K1 works for a short time alone and it's okay for him, that's good.
It's best for you to judge if this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should rotate K2 and accompany for hours while sleeping.
It is probably questionable in purely legal terms.
So perhaps the psychologist's statement is also coming.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Crimea / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole act but I don't want to get the title anywhere, maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by shaking himself with food and going to his robbery cats into the hallway.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats fear patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before each suicide to go and document the site of suicide and put the photos on the internet.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist conducts a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is transplanted to the patients, which is suppressed in the brain a centre of anxiety and ultimately put their fear in the extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another goes to death intentionally)
This is what fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough act I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this act is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password for the Wlan available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But it may take.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden fragments under the thumbnail over the entire length (outside).
They tried to pull him with a pincet.
Very hard to catch.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a ladder, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost every locomotive of the track wide H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm big "sugar cube" speaker in addition to sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It dominates the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, there are 14 to 128 driving stages as natural as 2 and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders log in fully automatically at a suitable digital centre.
It dominates all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with appropriate centrals.
For centrals that can only programme the CVs of 1-255 there are help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses allow the trigger of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogrammation with the respectable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to Mfx® compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake tracks as well as the ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake blocks or with equal voltage.
In addition, it also holds for a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendeltrainautomatic enables automatic commuting between two stations.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to boost vaccination
Always new Omicron cases bring politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, until New Year, all qualified adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make progress with the Corona boosting vaccinations even faster in the face of rapid increases in omicron numbers than has been expected.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a video message recorded in advance to his countrymen.
To date, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One faces an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection needs urgently to be strengthened," said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let yourself boost now," Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omicron cases were registered in the UK, increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favour of everyone presenting themselves with pronuns
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by email.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I have Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep an official over my feet either.
Concluding: everyone should imagine with pronoms.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Apparently, the chair had a not apparent lack of sales.
How else can such a polster damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since about.
14 days no longer.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to order and charge it to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write a little detail here about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I am more often in contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
A topic that really nails on me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims can't be helped or we don't think we can't help them.
I understand that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation under four eyes, with the offender far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know why, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of pissing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, partly, very close to the tears, it is all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do to "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complex names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball League: Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster John Patrick was relied.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said to Hakro Merlin's Crailsheim in early October, "We still have a bit of anger in the belly."
She did not lay after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) - defeat in the basketball League.
In which more than the naked result disappointed the way of appearance.
Substitute is a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The Trinity rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young John Patrick) at say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer gave John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained."
To move the ball.
Another thing was his response to Sebastian Gleim: "A cool game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago."
On Saturday in the Hohenlohe-Arena, only 750 visitors were allowed, but they were at their expense.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," said Gleim.
While in Patrick's team itself the sponsors like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already moved back to 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Fortunately, much time to hate remains not.
Already on Wednesday, at 19:00, the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, and then in Ludwigsburg, they receive a maximum of 750 viewers.
we used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves again in legal terms and have therefore re-enacted them.
We've originally reported to us six months ago.
Stitches like folded out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to enthusiastic his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he can show up.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't be any of it.
The planned concert was moved in May 2022 - "on official instructions" to curb the Corona virus.
Others of his performances planned in the Adventstime must not fail, as it is called on the website of the singer, who becomes 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January the artists then want to retrieve their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born December 12, 1962 in North Rhine-Westphalian Lunen, Max Raabe has already sang a lot and lovely as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with Komilitonen.
Since then, the bariton has established itself with his repertoire of beaters and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded awards many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts - just like his success album "For women, this is no problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche to the main stream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair hardened and thought of labels, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the "Good day, dear luck" program, he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has opposed the deprivation of large housing groups, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, no single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sonnday).
My goal is to provide tenants with certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A bunter mix of, for example, private tenants, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left wants to set up an expert committee on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the lighter coalition about further tightening in the lease law.
The coalition agreement provides for a lease brake by 2029, a limitation of lease increases in tight housing markets and an extension of the lease level.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the lease market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead by tornados in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been drawn through the United States.
Alone in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remind us of a war zone.
In the night on Saturday, several tornados have caused serious devastations in the United States and may have caused up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an about 320 kilometers of devastating snow, especially in the Kentucky state.
Her governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was over, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is at all possible.
He counts alone in the Kentucky state with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers increase every hour.
Hello, I just saw she was sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is there the possibility of ordering this glass in another country?
until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, only can I order the ceiling now and let it be delivered to Germany, which is in your shopping cart?
I had returned an article or given a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed because I haven't received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising rights
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are therefore on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising logans to call for vaccination - according to the German example - is also intended to increase the readiness to vaccinate Corona.
He's changed to a company that he's hit.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself at his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Assistance in the first own campaign
Boron to Greetings!
I am directing the adventure for a group of 4 friends About the Greifenpass and I want to bring my heroes seamlessly into a special campaign written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil men and their motivations are written, the individual file is designed and now I am about to write the entrance adventure and stumble already at the first meeting about my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a raft with grain from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran lake.
It is intended to develop further action.
A few miles away from the village, a group of Goblins is to lure the heroes into a stop.
I would like to give players the opportunity to solve confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threat, recognize the danger early, whatever the players find.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with arches and sails
If not noticeable, the Goblins rely on the heroes in a hollow path and flank each to three left and to the right arches arm me the truck, while two with spears stop the truck.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found and healed unconsciously and then by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
Of course, the car's gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, just this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to help the hero in the fight.
The car is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just canon feed.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narrative.
I built the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back.
If you can then let the return cards come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German sky has been decreasing more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to allow the F1 pre-reporting to begin in time.
Although the delayed start and start accident of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, stupid, especially since Sky UK has passed the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then in the F1 there was once again an ignorance of rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that the tyres were allowed to change under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that stairs could change the tyres when there were corresponding radio voices on this subject at Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for stepping.
I think that such basic rules should be easily known when commenting on the F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first riddle rate, which is now possible or required according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally, with the tailored comment style of Roos does not like, but give it to the taste matter.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
There are also constant albtries that make both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (also unwanted) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a total amount of unrest into the comment that he apparently does not take it seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run out Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into the advertising as you can listen to F1TV because only the German sound track has to come out without comment directly after the race.
Neither Servus TV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two broadcasters in the trainings make less advertising than Sky, and this as a free TV broadcaster.
While you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not leave me overlooking the disadvantages.
The remainder of Sky Sport F1 is also very delicate and full of repetition.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1.
Unironical RTL makes a better job for the four races that they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To this: #PRS_ORG# pendulum, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing to date.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already found a defect after relatively short time (the substance has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Ventilator pumps are excellently suited to provide an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium pumps with 2 or more outputs, you can connect more outputs.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer itself to put an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (see us in the shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure box, mustache or something like that.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an austromer, etc....and it can start.
The fan pump should be equal, or higher, as the water level and be mounted outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper like the water level, you should put a reverse valve between it.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water runs backwards that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the 3-day processing time here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the road, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is pronounced, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in the shipping industry...naturally here no Corona stops.
Please not evaluate as badly, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively because of the package services.
Of course, you like to shy over these services, even if we're saying right now... they've got it fucking hard
This is also very different regionally.
Be not evil to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you also order your legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the universe
The daughter of the first American in the All, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
On Saturday they were transported by the New Shepard rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezos took the freshly curved astronauts into reception after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 as a Nasa-Astronaut, flew into the All Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the Blue Origin rocket system was named, and 50-year-old TV-moderator Michael Strahan were guests of honor to the company, who had paid four other passengers for their tickets: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not report.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his efforts and do everything himself.
She was just so flying, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would prefer to return to the universe immediately, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers of height
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers over the earth, temporarily with gravity, before the reusable object was braked from large parachutes again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres across the globe as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out trip from Blue Origin: the first time in July, Amazon's founder Bezos was on board himself, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old American pavilion and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who was world-famous with his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Criticists call for Bezos and Blue Origin to promote the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite exciting in itself and also standing in the lab doesn't bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, before studying, I also informed myself about occupational prospects, but at the time I thought that I would and would like to study until the doctorate.
But at the moment I have doubts, particularly repressive of the occupational prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you always hear great career opportunities and the job is completely sought, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) What are you working at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you do this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and consider possibly to quit study in 2022 and make a training as a specialist informant.
If you have experiences, they also like to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This theme came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's just now.
Not only before great holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there are the days before the holidays plus bridge days.
This was the case: last week, Mariä was a sky ride, which is called the "surge" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So last week it was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Overall stress.
Lauter e-mails, which had to leave before the lift, order here order, all *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because the next week then sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to pay as much for all serious things in a short week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday then, but I was also powerful.
What's this self-hushing about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we are not allowed to give them up properly?!
The stress probably didn't come from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simple: Are only we, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical nature?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thai home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thüring Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree on the festival by baking and basteling with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But until the thoughtful days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mouses and the regeneration of the feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy vessel.
The majority of birds' damages to the vein are due solely to food defects.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, the formation of an adequate feather dress is a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occur during the mice are due to lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable proportion of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Unfortunately still not working
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the lok was in use in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare lok is probably derived from the proposal for the conversion of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with play tracks and defects see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electricomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly also from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we worked up operationally
In 1924 the Deutsche Reichsbahn Society had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive which would be capable of transporting 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG determined the supply as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens superstructures with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928 the delivery of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01–06 took place.
All survived World War II and then found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnverbesserungswerk Dessau, all six locomotives were reworkable.
[4] As the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network showed an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, with the other machines being used as spare parts donors.
First, E 04, E 44 and E 94 were built in larger numbers.
Only when the E 94 was expected that the number of repairs could not be further increased, the E 95 returned to the point of view of the preparation.
[4]The locomotives were soon stationed at the Leipzig-Waren railway station.
In 1960 they arrived at Halle P.
They were mostly used in their own circular plan before coal trains from the hostage valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, with increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives was shown.
So it was more often that guns were tied to switching.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly driving on this locomotive, with hammer and wooden bulb, had to dissolve the shooter during the journey.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of failure in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to renounce old locomotives and most fragments, so that the E 95 were out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted only one man to occupy electrolocomotives, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the conditions of vision of the driver.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-69, the last one followed the E 95 01, who quit the service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has therefore never been used.
Until E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant at the main train station Halle.
It took some time to convince those responsible for the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was worth maintaining as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external reworking of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle view in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as an unsuccessful museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completement of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is served museumally.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational development of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time to be an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paints, with the transformers being checked and five driving engines are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Schlesische Bergbahn and the departing sideways until 1945, where they proved to be proven due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were converted to the Central German network to Leipzig.
The main area of use was first Silesia.
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, it is optical reworking on the locomotive in self-work necessary, dusty, with tracks of play, odour of cellar !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packagings may contain labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..though these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately they are incorrectly produced.
The middle bar does not fit in the intended restraint.
So I'll send new ones.
When will they be sent off?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
These are, according to the mounting instructions, the right of the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing they're fulfilling their purpose
They're not flat with me
Can I get this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
House fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech County).
Two residents were reported to be hospitalized on Sunday with light smoking poisoning.
The exact cause of fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that there was an intentional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it's coming a lot later.
And I have to pay again for shipping
To deter fake-news - Biontech-CEO publishes Vaccination Photo
Uğur Ελλάδαahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" early 2021
Biontech Chief Uğur Ελλάδαahin had not so far publicly expressed his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The disease of a friend had moved him to do so, told him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Ελλάδαahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the corona virus.
There was false information in social media that I was not supposed to have been vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumours."
To date, he has rejected this because the communication should not turn around himself.
But one call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family weren't vaccinated, he continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most frequent cause, however, seems to be fear that is often driven by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German wave circulates, in which Uğur said he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German wave itself clarified.
"I'm not allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment by law," said Ελλάδαahin at that time.
There is a priority in Germany when vaccinating the Vakzins.
In the meantime, prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech Chief has been vaccinated three times, according to appropriate data.
Fire in conversion system: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and, in many cases, no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a conversion station.
After a fire with severe damage in a convoy station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Crisis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to cope with electricity for about 24 hours.
By the fire, on Friday night, 41,000 affected residents in several communities were exposed to lights.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care facilities in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The supplier thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have made significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, firefighters and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take several days, since the West Network monitors were able to re-operate some of the lines only provisionally, he said.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company information.
Electricity flows back
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m. greatly damaged parts of the 10,000 volt scaling system at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid conversion station.
There is a need for expensive cleaning and repair work.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday, 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Lot and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually switched on from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the most recently affected by the failure also had electricity.
Over 80 Monteures from Westnetz and partner companies had been in operation.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is now important that citizens take care of older or isolated people in their neighborhood and inform local firefighter houses if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus on the installation and operation of emergency power units was the inhabitants of old homes.
In addition, according to government information, temporary care facilities were established in schools for those who were unable to provide themselves or need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euro?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the underside on the table plate.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 comments on this.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today came my #PRS_ORG#, but I can't move it into one another and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted with a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
Can you send me the return card by email?
the repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, before buying, I had not rebooted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do this now?
I almost find such a low credit to be unfortunate.
We do not agree with this.

When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we both made s new and use the version 4.5...
may be that they have heard of problems more often
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG# it also seems to be on it.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.

As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in the meantime!
In order to make the colour order even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 lines.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to the brush.
Slight overlapping of the colour layers later ensures a uniform area.
Avoid swiping up and down with the brush.
This creates unrealisticly effective areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could look through later.
Metal tones and metal colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unclean metal sleeves can occur when they mix with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build it.
Originally faithful appearance reaches the models through the decals or drawing images.
From state marks on aircraft to ship names to the most badges and marks for car models: The Decals give the model the last loop.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components are still good to reach.
A plane cockpit can be tailored or easier before it is installed in the frog.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pinsets and toothsticks are when gluing time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each needed decal individually and fix it to you.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisturized their back with water shortly until the bearer paper becomes dark through the wets.
Then you only push the picture a small piece of paper and put the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have humidified before).
While you hold the decal onto the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper side by side.
Attention: Always check if the image is right before you shoot it completely from the paper so it doesn't stick on the finger, knit or even rip it.
Suck out excess water with a household towel.
Care not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and reload the book and look for the place where I read.
ON Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Can I get this by e-mail?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages.
Okay, thank you very much!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money comes back.
But can I get that back without any problems?
Child wish treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were in child care for some time, now that it's about the billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
The row after:
We had previously applied for the child's wishing tracking at the PKV and received the promise for 3 trials.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not yet count with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost recovery from the PKV and received 3 further trials.
After some further attempts (we have done more attempts than promised, logically expect the most expensive with the PKV) we filed the bills at the PKV and received the evil surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment is no longer present."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or we (they are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out in the promises that with one birth the further attempts would have expired?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (subject to closed egg leaders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts were to give your opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to reach them the best again?
All right.
We won't order anything with them anymore.
When they add the transactions from me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously lost a good customer.
They will be allowed to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was triggered and now tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I don't think I can do anything for the commode to come to me completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment has been triggered and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have lost two common customers now.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must last for normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as a office chair.
Regardless of this, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, it's not possible for me to get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the carrier.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are applied for with additional hookers, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low budget movie is accurate, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, e.g. on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's your attraction?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable now?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, there is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up soon again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halber Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory".
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation lastingly," said the scientist of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This slightness - Belarus does not add very little, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Handling with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is a "growing standardisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not firmly opposed, this goes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems to be impossible for a Member State to do its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its border policy with Belarus, Bossong said: a principle agreement on asylum policy would be difficult because the line "frontier protection, border protection, border protection" had been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have now again tried to enter the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesperson of the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been thrown with stones in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be provided medically by a military doctor.
In total, border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border blocks.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukashenko as a powerhold in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees to the country.
EU Commissioners also travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent their departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with severe bandays and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not committed to ensuring that the security device regularly locks thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula-1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen reportedly committed two breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 final, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows suspect equal to two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is supposed to have overrun irregularly.
A second objection was lodged against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not complied with in line with the rules.
In the last round, Lewis Hamilton was still outdated in Mercedes and was stuck to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch had overrun cars driving before him.
I'll check it out.
I'm talking to the bank and registering with you again
Thank you for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organises SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa Park, the namer of the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the Park, members and permanent card holders of the Sport Club from Breisgau and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
This day, the rear trains were lighting through the tricots red and white.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white airballons provided the perfect scenery," says the park.
Already since the beginning of the 1990s, cooperation has existed between the federal ligist and the recreational park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing raying fans who have fun together in the back track confirm this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is this €#NUMBER# and not as original € 1699 ?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read the Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.

I gave up yesterday the contact form for returning an article, but received no email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question came in.
It doesn't have everyone the time for your folded chat and wrongly delivered cheap products from China.
Your mistake you can fix and not all from our budget.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semitic means nothing.
It's like when an affair says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i won't admit it both.
But Mr Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it complete.
Yes, then you're not as serious as my colleague.
Whoever seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
For my sake, a God has brought the whole thing into operation.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and the science is just sucking insane.
And that's how you're a science enemy and not taking it seriously like a colleague.
In order to maintain an optimal field of vision, the loudspeaker should be as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic-designed lens system allows you to use the lens in a practically non-registrational and colour error-free way to the edge.
Lobsters are often marked with enlargement information.
However, this information applies only to specific conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
To be able to use your loudsize, please note the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see instructions in the package).
Light reflexes arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, also in case of impact valves.
These mirrors are significantly reduced by an antireflex coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are met - louds close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Star sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced a number of curious situations during the sale.
One time a man should even have gone home without his partner, because both couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants more than 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
That's always a little funny for the early night, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I have received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
I will then evaluate this accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And therefore, both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "driver", which doesn't sound so good at all.
Problems with fiber glass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which, up to a few failures, received and sent 50 Mbit properly.
The new fiber fiber connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer reaches the full 500, but the more I get away from the house with the module, the less it comes (i.e., use a plug that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber fibre connection is even slower on the first floor than before ( .45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that seems to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similar losses here.
Could anyone explain to me why with fiber glass so much Internet speed goes over the power line "lost"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to still move LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, so I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased with a reply.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Whoever thought it would be resting with the Girocots for the first time, sees himself betrayed.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the increases in fees in the past with all sorts of tricks by their customers, the amount of discounts for negative interest rates will also continue to fall.
For example, with a limit of EUR 100,000, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous for a long time.
Now she just halved the free amount and even quartered for the daily money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still in force, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to the Verivox internet portal, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of EUR 25,000 or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, who have even received the right to this regulation in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
Banks are already discussing whether institutions might have to make provisions - in the event that the upper institutions also have to declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially headed by Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made furores in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they will give themselves a chip a day (yes, rightly read: a INSCRIPTION chip from the bag).
The fact that you are flying the hearts of both female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just lucky and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she became mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurting.
Stay to hope that success and fame will also make happy.
Invaluable end of a career: Riikkunen must give up
Kimi Rikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 went still quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and wiped himself the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After an error of driving and a slight band touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for their good-bye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand-Prix winners, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60. World Cup victory - Nolte wins in Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've figured out this once, I'd have to win nine and a half per season, then I could do it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, on Saturday he rejected the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed a little to the material setting and took a larger advance on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he went ahead of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who travelled for Stuttgart, came to rank five after the second place this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in rank four in the first race on eight.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do that," Lochner said.
Nolte with Home Victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took the third seasonal victory of the two-erbob on her home track.
After it was only for the fourth place in Monobob on the previous day, she ran to the World Cup victory at the German tripartite success on Sunday with Deborah Levi.
Twoerbob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came to rank two with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first podestplace this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on place three.
For me it was super cool, first podest place in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed, "It's not just pushing, but there's a lot to do about it."
Jamanka was annoyed a little about the not entirely faultless rides, but said, "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and, therefore, I couldn't redeem why I finally asked.
By Corona last year I had quite different problems and never had time for it.
And now he said he passed out, which makes me very upset.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I would like to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16 March?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tip it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered would.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe the one or others are going like this...
I'm 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dogma - once apart from my dog doesn't scream or go to the nursery he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we've cheated a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the association wg burning).
It is cooled upstairs and we're seeing ourselves less (1-2x week) which makes me very creative with my needs for affection and love.
My dog kid just had abdominal pain, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cushion cover and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and scratching for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now also keep homework on us, which we of course share.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well treated, I'm half-treated well and I'm fine.
Not good, but I'm gonna be okay and I'm almost symptom free.
My college is demanding very much (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I have done nothing yet and overmorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I will have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no place left.
So my week goes like this: Only until overmorning, then it's weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual indications because otherwise I'm packing it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you're doing?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't take that in words at all.
I don't know if I would have survived my kpts.
I think that has partly got to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'm sure I'd find a passionate mate here...
I wish you one more relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the colour was just like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, two times.
But she was not confirmed.
Once again, I found at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and for them it is only another subject such as mathematics or earth.
For me, it was always a little strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christianly and I always believed in something like that.
How do you like it?
You may also be able to talk about colleagues in work and study with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
There is also a curricula, etc.
But would it just seem strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the relativity theory.
What does one have to want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
A real culture or something?
Hope your question isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write English I understand that too well
It's been a long time, then I wouldn't let it go.
It's okay, thank you.
I expect feedback soon, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Please help
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not very sure).
Since I can't describe it more closely in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers of the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live himself, I mean.
The transition is, I believe, the soldier's tomb.
In the end, both soldiers fight against each other.
If that is something I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl just slept on the belly from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like this lasts much more than you think.
Make sure everything's right, no cushion animals, often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it's sleeping.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it get up from the belly from something?
Or is it in front of the face Directly in the mattress?
That's what you can tell if everything's okay.
We all grew up, and when my husband came to the world, it was gang and there was that you put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stamming" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you then only offer me EUR 20?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague from you yesterday and I did not return to you so far.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently to be used.
To make it clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
It is simply so that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all the sucks.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big bed tour at the same time.
It was said that you were a "independent" Internet transmitter.
Citat Arno: You want to be "no running liquor column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
They of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A krogman who is completely lacking empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded spaces trying to make ashes.
How do you find that all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a back call because my supplied wooden table was defective.
Body break by damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in abdominal pain or just to cuddle – my little warmth friend is diversely used.
Cherch kernel pillows are a traditional home product for beneficial heat applications, as cherch kernel can absorb heat very well and give it back dosed.
The removable inside pillow can be warmed easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they're not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with reference is only suitable for the following applications as a heat suspension:
Before heating the pillow for untypical smell, check stock or fire spots and discard immediately when present.
Please remove the inside pillow from the reference before warming!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (Please note the details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Distribute the heat evenly in the pillow immediately after heating!
Then put the inside pillow in the reference.
The first warming may result in a light moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Obviously stick to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (inflammation and burning risk!).
Check before heating the pillow in the microwave that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been returned to the reference, please check the temperature of the pillow for babys (max. 43 °C) at your armchair!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or fevery diseases, circulatory problems, fresh haematomes, blood glands and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced feelings of pain.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes, or tumour disorders and pregnancy, please contact a doctor prior to use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are released, discard the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be notified to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt nach Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the Football League.
Now Hanover works 96 from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it is also not running under the third trainer.
Jubilee in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failure of the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
Error display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plug-in power supply.
After that, I built the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you want any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# up to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seating area is....
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack by Peak Design!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely spun with the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separated from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series is still present in a new look.
The smart, minimalistic design has literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally over the lid, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already been proven with the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the locking valve with suitable anchor bars on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "filling stands": there are 4 anchor bars, destroyed stablely, in which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is loaded full, you just take the top beam, it's rather empty, one deeper.
The valves and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be securely closed without grazing the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday backpack from other, photo backpacks: besides the lid, there is still a ribbon lock opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you don't have to go through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this smart detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday backpack, you can customize the interior (more below) and thus divert both easily from each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come between them.
Comfortable, easy to adjust straps help.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recyclated weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is intended to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# gave me yesterday an email from confirmation for the assignment of the

So far, I haven't received a message.
I ask for immediate resolution.
I'm already writing with the third support staff, I didn't get any further than the promise that I get an e-mail as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is not possible to see when the wardrobe could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When is the item delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp was delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the last year went different than I thought I could not expect and could not just redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer, and I do not accept that.
Roting brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of the brakes also under difficult conditions.
Roting brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically worked (bored and cut).
All stained discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the balance of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The dotted discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake valves.
The aesthetic properties of our dyed discs underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event marked the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bulbs in the water on the southern facade of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were sealed, tents were opened, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make himself a name.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, bring together horses and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to go beyond your pionier colleagues, not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, you need to budget with your resources and create a table that more and more "works" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules in your favour.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official stateliness).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will be secretly selecting a location on the playtable at which they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection will be discovered and their pioneers will be placed in the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing possible actions there.
Then the players take alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening business and positioning revolving heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The awardee turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This will continue until the pricer moves five times, so every location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting facility in which players have to defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are more than the bandits in number, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final valuation takes place.
The player with most win points wins!
In the case of free shipping, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the type of shipment, goods shipment (includes games).
In all other cases, most of the DPD is insured and with transmission tracking (included games, wrapped with tiles and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send cardboard cardboard in the cardboard box at an additional cost of 2 euros, which is 100% free of printing.
"Why children are not tyrans" doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I've just looked at it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talkshows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children become Tyrannes" (2008), he launched a violent educational debate.
Former patients: women and educators now raise serious accusations against him.
Please watch out, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible must never, never, never! be talking about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for its development and to make the framework for the child as useful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: countries advise on dropping the test requirement for triple vaccines
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a federal drop in the test requirement for triple vaccines.
"We countries need to know quickly whether and from when the test requirement can be waived for three vaccinations," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), President of the Health Minister Conference, the "Photo on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically useful, but also provides additional vaccination incentives," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the health ministerial conference on Tuesday". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I do that best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping via my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated account data.
What can this be of?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensual perceptions under full narcosis.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most frequent is to hear sounds/speaks, more rarely to see images, and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: Emperor cuts are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep narcosis is avoided to protect the child until it is discarded.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthetic conversation.
Certain procedures of anaesthesia such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment by me describes consciousness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex ** per definition none.
I've read her comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ will not help us.
These are legal warranty rights.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
This is not only a legal obligation but also a standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
Then we sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an e-mail you didn't answer.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice, the item is delivered to a room of my choice.
The transmitter is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Don't you think I'm calling?
I had asked a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an officer.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I've already witnessed my life's thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is European pallets, standardised wood pallets, which are used as loaders, especially in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to statistics Austria, over ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was more than 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria is not collected
New York gets the MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular playtime against host Portland Timbers, the team of the Eastern Conference decided the final in 11-meter shooting with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had passed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rolling Tips & Tricks
I had received many great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulasch.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to taste and I want to cook for the first time in the New Year's.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a furnace, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I'll get that
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not been received from me.
Please check that out.
Where there are still Christmas breads in the Lübeck room
For many people goose or ence belongs to Christmas days such as the pine tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now the time is short.
We'll tell you where you'll get a Christmas bread in Lübeck's room.
The "drive" of a tube end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level and the disconnected content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and the distortion.
Further above, it sounded like you can even float a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it comes loudly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulators, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with boxing simulation, so that even when using a headphone or direct recordings, you get an outstanding "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate sounder.
Anyone who also spends a VFS5 foot key can also easily call the sounds on foot, switch on/off the effect blocks and "tap" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is going a further step in the future!
But had seen that with others.
Can you send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the comode?
Do we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are a little bit.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know whether screws were planned as part of the delivery.
I would like to install the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
There are progress in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement, according to Iran's information.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna news agency.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first it did not even rule on the subjects to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had been continued after almost one week of interruption.
Negotiators of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also involved on site in Vienna, but only indirectly in the negotiations.
Thuringia Overcoming Saxony - Free State now Federal State with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has resolved Saxony and currently has the highest national incidence.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1,000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was located at the Corona incident on Sunday above the mark of 1,000.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had last always shown the highest national incidence, this value was 990,5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1,000.
Within one day in Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths associated with an infection were reported.
200 severely ill in Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health services have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly behind the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and put it at the mail, that was it, isn't it?
I don't have to click/notify/fill anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I write to you.
I would like to take over the return on my own.
8 euro return fee is in my view a frankness.
It's time for changes
On Monday, you will welcome me, I am U/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundtag you can find one thing: it is not existing.
We came to a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
Most of this is likely to be simply related to the discontent, how some things have happened here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many of us here really still have bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked around the MBundtag, who wants to keep it alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found, simply speaking, a squirrel.
After a few writings, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only so can this project exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a disc server on which we can exchange each other, as well as work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundtag work in the future?
* What existing orders must be modified / adjusted / removed?
* How should we act outward in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not bad, so we end up having the discord.
If you have a desire and time, come to the discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp screen with you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in over size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective cabinet is picked up in time.
And I ask you to make this happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will install the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to agree to a pick-up date.
Is there a instructions for mounting?
How long would I have time to get these or decide to return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, I guess at the moment also rarely eats meat.
I myself used to be a few years of vegetarians.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much thinking.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but sometime I reflected and understood that I ultimately also supported animal torture.
That is why my decision to become vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that her side was discouraged, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and they were reduced as vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly put into a corner as a Veganer and conflicts arise without that you would put it on it.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clear that it is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not dissolve from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am on the assigned date at which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, it can't be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I'm constantly reappearing.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz at Lahnsteiner Rathaus sent a grant of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car water rescue of the volunteer firefighter Lahnstein to the mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle in operation since November 2020 amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the Land Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
Lahnstein counts on increasing efforts: the boom of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel and the continued increasing use of lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOT worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now hopes for help.
Okay, that's what's going on.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for setting up the whole thing here for the first time, I have spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, saying we were also gun carriers in the executive, I don't want to go on!
The question of the right and left I always find very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the minister of state comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, even in special uniforms and arms carriers, it should be clear to everyone that these people can easily handle the living reality, of course, because you have, in addition to the average white, many Germans with migratory background, women and also homosexuals (and I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché homos, because in the executive there are rather less than nothing but quite normal men and women to whom you don't notice when they can't tell you) and I also have to rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or use this for you.
But even these marginal groups, even though it sounds strange for my experience to be a conservative attitude, are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing policies, even if this policy is supposed to have to work for them or think it to make them right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, because of the fact that of course police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forging any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated in the media and irritates me too.
Of course, it is just policemen and soldiers who were often involved in foreign operations often start to fasten because of negative experiences and even sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also true that right-wing fellow minds also meet themselves who are exercising a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and is also counteracted by political education and education!
Germany is so internationally confused and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford at all to have the right racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available anywhere in Germany.
I always think you're the only partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wood part are two deep canvases filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More regular by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been working on one thing for a long time.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure), but for my life I've been getting more bad than getting to my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and cleans up.
But it is never so 'that someone could come spontaneously'.
My husband is (sorry) not better either, although it disturbs me somewhere but usually loses household simply against work and discomfort.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get more regular with a child?
We have not worked on it yet, and I have been working on this question for a long time.
For for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so doll as long as no visit comes and, for example, there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater encouragement with a child or stay silly?
Look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have now been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I see more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time to start up again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearfully avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means, grossly speaking, that I have no sense of self-esteem and, consequently, I am shy.
I have no problem talking to people at a substantive level, but it's very difficult for me to have relaxed conversations and I've been told more often that I'm acting in close proximity (when I think it's been better).
Can I become social workers?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counselling or family assistance, for example.
But I don't know if the actual working day really is the same as I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there's something to challenge my code (spoke in the simplest things again) and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues to help (I'm supposed to know how it's going to be)/"I'm holding him off with my stupid questions from work"/"he really has to think I'm less mediated" etc.).
I'm probably going to have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it in the place.
But you've already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a date for pick-up
What do you mean to give me back?
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not get your #PRS_ORG# authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein (protein) included with the feed breaks the bird into the individual protein builders (amino acids) in its stomach-intestinal tract and builds its own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of the vein.
The formation of the feathers in the nestling and the regeneration of the feathers in the miceing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the entire animal organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding because otherwise there may be disturbances in the breast cycle.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply of NEKTON-S (multivitamine preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/ soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A removed knife (inside) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In the event of severe vascular damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach to vascular regeneration is visible.
After this, the normal dose is stretched until the regeneration of the veins is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as a office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty rights in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in the appeal to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
It's supposed to be a walnut tree on our property.
So filed an application to the municipality.
A staff member writes to me that the case of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the Statute, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the Statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
That's what we understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany.
Can you check that?
Notification: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently a serious traffic accident occurred at St 2179 between the Selb-Nord and Plötsberg connection.
According to the press alarm currently reported to the police at 14:03 a.m., a car came into the counter traffic when picking up.
There are injured people.
Oh, okay.
Well, then many thanks again for doing so easy!
Advice and ideas on further working life
Merry Christmas for the first time!
My Christmas is relatively good, unfortunately, because my dear head just breaks everything you can think of.
Before I go out here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who know my situation - that is, of you.
I'm just making the ref as a crosser.
Initially I studied something else and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But then it was all too boring for me and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the teaching office and I was sure it was - even if the conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I arrived at the third "I google other job bids" now.
And it's only half a year around.
In the paintings I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still turn.
But right now, I'm completely done.
I've had so little free time last month that I'm completely out of my mind.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was my weekend as well my weekend and my evening my evening.
That's where I had free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family party itself is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that are more nervous to me.
Basically it makes fun and from outside the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely nutsed and wonder how much stress my body holds before it turns completely dense - if he doesn't do that right now.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some contributions from you - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, because where I was valued, I could take free time if I needed it, and although the work was kind of boring, but was properly paid for it and worked out something together in a team and not as a single fighter as it is now most of the time.
But then I wonder if I did not come back in a year to the same place as now and be unhappy.
You realize it's all kind of awesome, but maybe as an outside advice or ideas, how I get out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and almost at the smallest thought of crying about it.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the crying undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has evolved continuously, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitate the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling machine that is absolutely up to date in sound matters.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and Amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain, of course, the multi-stage Valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spray.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led again to a boost in performance of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From handy VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for a maximum volume of sound are found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanciered playback of game dynamics and string attacks as well as an instant speech.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the final stage determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, is perfect for the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough to win the Los Angeles clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, the magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles clippers.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually plazable and folded plug-in parts, it is fully tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror mirror cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack depends naturally on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible installation would be a DSLR camera with a set-up objective, two to three alternate objective and a set-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can dig a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Serie) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photographic things.
The everyday backpack 20L also offers an optimal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic outbreak on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the lava streams on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
To date, the outbreak of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was the longest on the Atlantic Island in front of the West Coast of Africa with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, volcanologists were not able to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damage in millions of dollars
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, the colded lava produced two new tunes with a total size of about 50 hectares.
In particular, banana cultivation, which is vital to the island, has been severely affected, of which about half live directly or indirectly and which was already in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas stands in front of the door and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have linked something seductive to the spiritual atmosphere and the sparkling tension itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of donation so that the gesture of donation, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-building "contract of natural people", which avoids rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How the Christian child became from Nikolaus
Strongly taken, it was the Protestants through which Christmas days were closely linked to the donation.
Previously, gifts were presented in some way at Nikolaustag.
The background of this still popular tradition is that the Holy Nikolaus, as Bishop of Myra, has thrown three women secretly gold into their windows in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of donation, the custom popular in Germany emerged to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants were confronted with this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and human beings as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from the Nikolaus and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the donation thus moved to the Holy Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions so closely, it is only the least upset that the habit of Saint Nikolaus, similar to Martin's use with Martin's singing and Martin's move, is still an integral part of the premature night.
Today you can find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the Day of Donation moved to the Holy Eve.
However, in all Christian countries there is a joyful cuddle muddle about who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christian child appears in the Holy evening or the Santa Claus, which in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, which has been assigned some kinds in time.
These include, for example, his white bark, which has little common with the rather stringent assyrerbart of the historical figure, his sleeve drawn from pensioners and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who should have given them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabulous beings sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought father Frost to some fame.
Here there are not pensioners, but three horses that draw his sleeves as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of reformation during the wars of Hussites, the Christian child is responsible for the surrender of gifts.

Police shoots suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
Close to the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told us that callers reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
There would have been shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume that there was a terrorist background.
There are several messages in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

In the Hollywood Spectacle, they are mostly threatening objects from far-reaching galaxies, which flourish inwardly coloured.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this sunlight shines fascinatingly – optionally in white or colourful light (in equal to six different colours).
The edgeless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: like a naturally formed large silicon, this modern light object presents itself at daytime.
Its organic rounds fit in any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pine and finders, where he knows to claim thanks to his size.
Great pre-working can save you: As a solar lamp, »Smart Stone« does not require any wire or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" at any place that shines from the sun on days.
Two supplied ground sprays ensure a firm hold if necessary.
The matt-white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside it, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colourful light.
The battery already loads when sunlight falls on the housing.
When invasive dawn, »Smart Stone« begins to light self-shine; in which color, you determine it yourself: just six attractive light colours are available to you – next to daylight white.
Finally, switching off will be done automatically as soon as the battery loading stand has fallen to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts on the next day from the front.
I've done that several times it doesn't work.

Pillar Problems
Hello, dear female people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit actually is my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredible pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again because I already have to take enough medicines because of chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last approximately two-year break I had received from 0 to 100 explosive pickles and these everywhere.
As far as superficial as possible, but I've been very busy and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of break, the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without gedoons, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
I'm afraid the woman doctor hasn't taken me so seriously and the skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the beloved skin is such a thing.
Was prebupertary had severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nut flakes and the acne theme.
Food I also tried everything I could in the course of chr. disease and remained hanging on sugar, milk and poor meat mix food because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm inside, but if you have like I have everywhere the building site you also prefer not to go looking for what else goes wrong.
I already had all of her colleague semina o.e.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and I do not know what my concern has been answered.
I've always got to work on the phone, and all of it was gone.
what is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
but there is it in general in large

110-kV ground cable is being rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The Government of Niederbayern's decision to establish plans opens the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was now communicated to the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre earth cable will connect Tann's conversion plant in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and the parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a Mast of the free line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has arrived only in parts with us.
The blue betsell number:#PRS_ORG# with the consignment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "No delivery possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next thing is going on?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that yesterday a number of times!!
This is a comeddy of glass and the entire sides are broken up, so there is everywhere glass and the carton is broken
The command stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the command cannot be picked up because no one can enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message
but why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, so the question at #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem
Ref: Education plans (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the ref since summer, I've been having fun teaching, but I still have great problems in time efficiently planning my teaching in the field of Earth Sciences.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can also copy only s/w free of charge (what is nervous for Earthquake).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geofactors and with me actually stands for each hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest excessively much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
In planning, I am actually always starting from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I'm rather unhappy.
Therefore, the worksheets are also available.
Maybe I can get a teacher in Earth Sciences how to work with the book in time efficiently.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already chosen a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to finish the returns as soon as possible for the first time.
The trade fears because of the 2G arrangement for Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or healed are allowed.
The trade finds this unnecessary and complains of sales breaks.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE) the 2G rules destroy the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of transactions involving articles of non-temporary demand, sales break-ins should be complained, criticized HDE Chief Executive Officer Stefan Genth.
According to a current HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already depreciated the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without soil," Gent said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crisis transactions in the past week.
Good run it only in the food retail as well as in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G when shopping does not bring us on in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current rules discouraged customers and required a high level of personnel.
The volume system had to be accepted throughout the country, he called for.
Afterwards, each customer should only be checked on 2G (vaccinated or healed) once and would have accessed all business on that day with the volume received.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retail trade, as already in public transport under the 3G rules (vaccinated, healed or tested).
The Deutsche Euroshop real estate group specializing in shopping centres also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies last without 2G were almost 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, and the turnover was about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, the Centre is trying to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "for example, visitors at a central location in the center can once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel - can enter all shops without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cast with a yellow filler.
That looks awful.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it into the package and collated it.
How do I have to proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to adjust and store the color temperature manually in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flimberless.
The 120 degree radiation angle with which you can light large surfaces at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the movie set or the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in difficult places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery)
User memory The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply press one of the storage keys.
The memory controller stores the current condition of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is restored when switching on new ones - very practical in studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have sufficient power - it's a battery tester installed with - a value in the two display displays for each of the two battery compartments (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply electricity to the headlamps via the supplied power supply.
The design of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm hull as a connection for fixing, so you can get directly to your photo tativ.
The inclination must be adjusted reliably by means of fixers on both sides.
It has been noted that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a niche joint is included in the range of delivery.
Great is that is also included in the range of delivery a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Shame, I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of defeatless Hessen were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga-Pleide.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour shot the frustration about a pervasive seasonal start from the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN gratified and said a "Pauschal praise, to every individual who was involved".
At the beginning it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters who are now still in rank nine behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusens with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am madly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defense player Christopher Lenz, who for the first time was able to stand back in place since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly large," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
But Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the future tasks, but is also well positioned in terms of the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we all players have fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but players also live highly professional.
Now you want to "step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "to this level" until the year change.
The next event will be on the show on Wednesday in the course of the English week at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
Grades I get the email that my package comes back to you because of an error on my part.
I tried to call at #PRS_ORG# and to redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent back directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is returned and give up the order again?
To me, unfortunately, I will not order again because it has taken a long time.
Have they ever been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dämper for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women were looking out of the parquet with hanging heads and empty views.
At 16:32 (8:13) the DHB selection in front of 800 spectators in Granollers was defeated and must now run against Spain in the quarter final.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Henk Greener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game of all that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semifinal, against the World Cup seconds of 2019, a significant increase must be made on the next Tuesday to keep alive the tender dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German Werfer in the Duell with the three-time Olympia winner Denmark was back room player Alina Grijseels with six gates.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defence," admitted back room player Xenia Smits and asked: "We must look forward quickly now".
From front to back not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team with the tip was not at the height.
Failures and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 return after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully concluded a quick response.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not this.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, German women could hardly put themselves in scene - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since back room player Mia Zschocke saw little later because of a hard foul on her counterplayer also red.
In the quarter final, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half of the time came the DHB selection a little better into the game and until the break at least five gates.
The still quiet hope for a pick-up after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greens sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to raise its performance and became a clear loser of the parquet.

Can they do that?
The title is that I am active as a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccination teams where (to date only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
As these are soon largely finished, then part of the course will continue in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided they are not personally related (e.g., "I take medication X, I take it with vaccination.").
In my task area, the information for vaccination, the indication position (people have the right to vaccination according to corona vaccine order and no reasons that speak against), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (I've never happened before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified staff, such as medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often have not, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but who cannot carry out vaccinations (may?) so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Serious "Hudlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "hudler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an amberger, the BR television broadcast "We in Bavaria" has been used to give a strong thought.
But, unlike many previous days, the term "host mi?" was unthinked by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a man who was nervous.
And none of them, who have to go fast.
That, people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
To what the man from Amberg told the solution, and thus also caused surprises in many top traps.
"The hudler," the spectators learned, "is a lap with which someone washs the oven."
Dialect scientist Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert from Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical superficial term, derived in some way from the more well-known mouth type word "hudern".
Which closed a gap in education - probably also for some who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice at the racing wheel- really so panky?
Tomorrow I woke up full of action because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour next week.
Says, did and I drove with my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city centre (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud cishing and my rear tyre didn't want to join the rest of the route at all.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and a replacement hose, I had to turn back with half a bad mood and take the first best train home.
Then was not so bad in sound technology, maybe it's better if I practice it again before the bike tour with the tire change.
Now, however, I stand before a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance for several days before me, I would be extremely unpleasant to get this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because even the old tires from the pre-owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike to 14:00 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he has been driving on roll with them for many years.
But if I think that when I drive to 80-90kms, I think I'm really bad:D
Now I came to a conversation with an older man on the railroad, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplatable.
Now, of course, this whole thing sounds very attractive.
But are these really so uncaputable?
I don't want to spend 40€/mill now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I am currently on the race bike I believe 25x622.
They are also (evidently?) available with the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use other tyres on a racing bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to me absolute! Lay knowing rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you once in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car slides against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was hit on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained reasons against a central island and then reached the countertrailer, as the police told.
There came a frontal collision with the car of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then dragged against a tree and the man stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured during the accident and brought to nearby hospitals.
Yes we have we deleted all books all the tyre authorized and loaded new books

After the publication of our new High End Breitband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time for our SOLO series to be regained.
SOLO 15 is called the new sprayer and is an optical reminder of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this proposal includes an appropriately designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The principle of SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but is intended to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
This does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears to be considerablely grown and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a light high-tone increase.
This is generally common in broadbands to optimize the high-frequency bundling that is significantly increasing.
Precisely focused on the hearing area, SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outside, the high-tone range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereodriangle is measuring sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy tynamic that seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 thus supplements not only our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution capacity and battery rates.
As with all our building sets, it is recommended to begin by thinking about the final optics of the speaker to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnace will reload material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), first a 8 mm hole should be drilled into the floor plate at the appropriate point to be able to perform the cable easily later.
With the help of an upper furnace, the speaker opens in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used bouncely later.
Reversely, this opening should be fitted with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker cassette inside as large as possible.
The four screwpoints of the B 100-6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture 'Detail Phase'.
Afterwards you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
On these are now the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor glued.
The three stitches should also be used and glued.
The amplifications themselves may vary in the material thickness, if, for example, you want to use finished ropes from the construction market instead of making them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, the two sides, as well as the front.
The application of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, is facilitated by a suitable hole-circuit saw or a wooden drilling.
Then you use a round greener to bridge all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footboard can also be rounded.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly collated with the foot of the housing and further screwed with long wood screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-bohring (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker cassette and the connection clamp.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (sucking / blowing out), you start with the move of the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
You push the entire and uncorrected cable piece by piece through the 8 mm drill into the foot until the terminal opening and let it stand about 30 cm out there.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable leads to the speaker opening and lets it be relaxed.
The frequency weighing is prepared and used below.
The design plan of the frequency weigh, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: mounting instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency weigh is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening is sealed inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glues onto the opening and so close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to description.
Then the B 100-6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the extra line (marked cable) must be invoked on the speaker's pluspole (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut down and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and let it only be delivered in early June?
> Hello to all,
> finally, we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it is still pandemic – yet we will give everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Make yourself cold drinks, plan good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
