Parliament has not ratified the amendment for Tymosenko's release
The Ukrainian Parliament refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft revocation of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
Members refused at second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced to 7 years in prison in October for having concluded a pre-defenced agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko described the judgment as political vengeance of the regime and caused a process of suspicion of partiality of the court also in the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MEPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are still to be determined.
As usual in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but are they moderate or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the normal law of the Charia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a thief we cut the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the unrespectful of faith may be punished by the death penalty...
It is the Coran who will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya, such an order will prevail as we cannot represent ourselves and would certainly not like it.
But our way of living is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted assistance with recognition of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who led NATO's strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated in every attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shooting, served Islam, and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political alliance without bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly occupy Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crops".
Without land occupation, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will eventually be able to devote itself to the protection of the human rights party.
For as long as we stop those charia supporters.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the spotlight of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published GDP relative information for 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published their economic development visions earlier for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better positioned than expected (creation of 0.3% instead of 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
However, GDP stagnated, and according to the Czech Statistical Office, it is confirmed that the trend towards a gradual decline in economic growth is being confirmed.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to planned and recalculated periodically.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what the analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
The returns of Spain and Italy's obligations are rising to critical limits.
The problems begin to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc....
The returns on Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation in the region is worsening.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the last instance 's guarantee .
The Czechs were qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football representation has succeeded in its most difficult mission in the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also dearly defended a good share of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed reportage.
No special excitement during the first part and a great share of luck for the second part.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrains found themselves under pressure until the second part due to a specific Czech defence.
The game's vicitms were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a prize of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes we played a football warrior.
The two teams were hard to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not perpetuate the Czech defence that responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want this gesture to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of any Israeli attack.
Students began praying in front of the site at noon and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Islamic universities have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre of Islam where uranium is transformed.
They expressed openly that they would defend the nude programme of their country at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There is a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in Israel.
Students began praying in front of the site at noon and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: do not take breakfast and take carcasses for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren have a weight above average and 5% are obese.
As the current research shows, obese children come from families with a malhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being and the models surrounding it are changing.
On the tables of obese children, for example, 50% carcass is more common than in children's families with normal weight.
19% of obesity had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the small big sports is also not a habit, which is now the case for most today's schoolchildren - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 students from Tsjechia primary schools.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have registered with this project.
One of the key factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the absence of proper diet and insufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eat 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - taste-dining, which is a basic principle of good diet," says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and carcass at dinner
The specialists draw attention to the fact that in order to have a healthy development, some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time are needed.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students eat at the same time.
In most families each takes their breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that one tenth of the population does not at all take breakfast.
Breakfast is nevertheless the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families with obese children, ill-healthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - without mentioning weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children in question regularly sports, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food on the basis of their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy diet."
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meat and sugarries.
"The most alarming is, inter alia, a great preference for sweet limonades," is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it is the pasta that took first place right in front of white meat.
Children did not want fattening at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health cap
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet has been required," reports the results of the survey.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sweet limonades as children started to give preference to drinking water.
Most often, children have cooked white meat and fish as the main dishes on the questionnaire and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (the Czech speciality of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, says professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I became a little angry because there were many from the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen later.
The presentations of three specialists, the dressing of characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach the final reviews and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk".
This time we have treated with director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) as to how to dress the woman who has no standard wings.
And women like this are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other one has a boy body, without a special curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically amplify broad arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
So we arrived to underline the character nicely and also not to dress too visibly of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between size and hips in such a way that skirts or pants don't pass at all, it is worth making it customized.
And you will not regret it because the garment that falls unfortunately is invaluable.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in that that glides continuously, rolls and does not hold the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style dressing, with pieces of necklaced fabrics, or even embroidery.
Of course, there are many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I am also afraid that in view of what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality and its appearance.
I'll have to "clothe"Miranda Kerr, what you might know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
In my heart, I am pleased, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has taken almost 100 pounds in recent times (not taking my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search on the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking also about the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses physics, but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphicist, maintained all of this.
But this... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three speciality guests gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday meeting filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphicsist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talent stylist can work with just one dress in a different way.
Variability is for this essential example.
Like, for example, this trench-coat that must be worn classically with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the body naked, with scarpins and take it in photo like a dress.
Or just get up the sleeves or neck and have a new look immediately.
"Being able to do this" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then begin to fight it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the Ben fashion photographer, that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (thousands of models) I must be ready to "restore" at least a fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this during a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made it a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of the stylists remains fragile.
And well-known faces sometimes consider them unnecessary (it's enough I know something but what I appeared goes to the second row).
And if someone gets made a styling on our side, then we have to count on the fact that he dictates us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we have to navigate on google and make sure that boulevard's info mentions the celebrity in question, if it is thinner or grosser, etc....
Honza and Mario put us on the heart on Sunday that it's not enough for the stylist to orient themselves into fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not to flatter, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his wardrobe and fill it with new elements, you can't throw everything and say, "My God, what awful."
"You will find some things that you will find nice and him you will advise with what to wear them," said Mario.
This has shown us concretely what should contain all what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, scrolls for deposition, or also napkins, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the scissors or other type of agraft are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
In order not only to be people who listen but who have tried something practical, they taught us how to wear shoes properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sow could damage, at fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We had no right to touch the scissors in order not to inadvertently hurt ourselves.
We really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me for my creation.
The count that I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course
I'm starting to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, which everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is fighting throughout America.
Revision
Originally, a problemless race is transformed because of a set of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills up to a certain degree the ambition of everyone, but it does not serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to get out some kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how to be the added passages during which the main hero walks out of his car and does what he wants.
As already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was reached.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole moves down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible misunderstanding by the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken into the adventure whose main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are pretty nice even though the graphic level is of the same type as the previous series.
Finally, this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more time-to-time accredited with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandy storm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that a avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition to this, the different races are well aggravated behind each other.
There are only a small number of them, but that is enough.
Just a few moments ago, you try to exceed the number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then run against the watch (twelve classics with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police that enters the game and tries to make you the situation tricky.
The newness is the out-of-vehicle passages.
It's rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you need to help him by taping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is well like this because this element is not likely to be bothered and placed, in the context described above, in the elements that allow the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you have to go to another place.
But although one can find better in competition, the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
The problems begin to occur after a certain time.
At the different driving model, the collision model is not yet at the point.
We do not expect this game to be complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have any idea of how your car is going to behave in a collision with any object, it's not completely good.
During the tight crossings you sometimes touch each other slightly, but otherwise your car goes into crazy voltages.
Or I'll see you in the midst.
Thanks to the rebooting system, this is not really a problem but it really disappoints you.
The rebooting is done so that when you broke the figure or you came out in the decor the game brings you back at the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you used the 5 reboots you must start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, if something doesn't happen as you need, something you can really count on.
Sometimes reboots do not help and you need to find the solution by remembering the route piece in question.
The big hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that must be passed in a certain way otherwise this does not happen.
Otherwise you meet in a given location of "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute in late.
What makes you angry are situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, you must either sit off and turn them around or brake them.
It doesn't matter if you go in front of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always arrives close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
All the time of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This is most annoying at the end of the game when you roll on a long bridge in the reverse direction.
The opponent must come in front of you at any cost.
When he passes before you he hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you come into collision many times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you are quickly bored.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it doesn't matter if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the race order is such that there is no chance to get bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You need to take care of petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time that you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight motorways and exotic sports cars on very technical drives, for example, on lacet roads in the mountains.
And the fashion of challenges, which are races in special places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only medals, but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest level of driver, different objects start to unlock:
It connects on-line with the Autolog function that, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest to understand is the situation of the last adventure race.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (it looks like) where you roll in the darkness on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (prior) and behind you arrives a metro frame that sends you the car directly to the railroad.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about when creating this game or if the authors really think we're stupid.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is embarrassing is that in more extreme situations, imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This especially applies to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery no longer serves you.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to enjoy the most many and especially the most young audience a new sound track was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect anyone to buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
Amusing is really good, but prepare yourself for errors to hit you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velour Students in concert with the choirs of the Charles University

Vicenova, Ambassador near the European Union:
The Czechs act as negativists and euroscepticists
"The Lisbon Treaty radically eliminated the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a tough war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova started her presentation at the Faculty of Law, Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relationships in such a understandable and visible way as many speakers of the Faculty of Law at Charles University could envy, she showed how she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new President-in-Office of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that he is fade, that it is a round-leather, that he cannot replicate any mission and I must say that he has cut the breath to everyone because he holds his role in perfection."
"This is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "Which phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater readability of the Union's policy towards the states, like China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked pasta cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that has been lived, lived and will live in the near future by the European Council.
She appointed the Czech Presidency two years ago as successors.
The Czechs resolved the upcoming financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the gourmet as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve now.
In addition, the new Union's seven-year budget, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation, needs to be approved.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and for savings, which sector will be the priority, which countries will be most assisted, at least, everything is to be resolved in the future negotiations.
The Ambassador reminded her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornichons, bananas differently large or that no one has banned us from making syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being euroscepticists and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
In her view, the error is due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a subsequent Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Great me, when come to me the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French said, "Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad doing?" and he is not happy at all."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, the Member States are waiting for tough new budgetary policy rules.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at multiple speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
First of all, it was said that the countries that want to cooperate between them and those who do not want to cooperate remain in their corners."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," says Mrs Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all themes affecting the EU to be debated between all EU members and not only the euro area members.
History of a brand:
The IBM Innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses the nearest IBM strategy, the nearest would be "the long term".
For a broad audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and however since its creation it has passed 100 years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE!" has become the footprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
It was the basis of the company culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and, however, did not be afraid to change everyone around her.
This has enabled us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more" has been the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano for the anniversary.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the '30s, began to take care of his employees such as Bata in the Czech Republic - the only people of IBM were among the first American employees to have paid holidays, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commmercials.
Similarly, IBM has a well developed relationship system with the client.
The society was at the beginning great in discovering talents - as one of the first companies to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano in the head of IBM.
It has been working with IBM for thirty years and is currently positioned as Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing what is called jamy, brain-storming online over the last few years from which many future strategies and innovations are derived.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a safe position in the business field.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than of a technology company," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a company that helps solve business world problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is known to be in the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it grew up to become one of the largest companies in the world.
Of course, it is the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, advice services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the banknote distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the discette.
IBM found itself this year with $ 220 billion the second largest technology company based on market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996.

It is not all innovations and manufacturings that had the client's and then't preferred - for example, IBM did not succeed in bet on a own OS/2 operating system, from the Probable online service or from the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the advance movement you can't emotionally remain hanging on the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
In contrast, for example, to the Microsoft concurent that at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A Perspective Technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for one fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However, it was still in 1990 with more of the strongest participation motive for hardware.
As of 2000, IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies during that period.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it exceeded the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the terms of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the major economic crisis.
Now it appears that IBM passes the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price increased by 120 per cent from 2008 and the company's net profit continued to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
It can be expected that this flexible giant will control other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese sections to flights in the cosmos.
The IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York 100 years ago and originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the old "pointers", the slopes that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was chaired by the Supervisory Board of Society until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competitor company Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made shadows to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that so far the identity and culture of society are based.
Watson led the company Kusqu in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, started with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat slices to the recorders.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased up to $9 million and the company began to expand in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the company that after 40 years of management, his son was the one who occupied the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sells its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased the Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to smartly overcome technology in areas that are not yet exploited, such as transport and urban management.
With regard to the IBM trade area, a "Smart Trade" platform has recently been developed that helps business manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing centre of Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became guardian of the body and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only it could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in the summer in Bartosova in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he publicly confessed that he loved him.
With the time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's relationship and finally said goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband sleeps with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her to the door of the house.
"This is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my loved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," said Rychtarova filtered, showing that she has separated from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a paper wedding and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we're talking completely normal, but we're not sleeping together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he will not stop it.
"We don't sleep together and he doesn't care where she's going, with whom and if she has a relationship.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all responsibility on myself," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: This also concerns you?
If you ask men to determine typical shortcomings of women, all, both, are capable of "out of their sleeve".
Ladies and gentlemen, you're going to know in the following lines of female vices who can pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchasing
Your half makes you comments that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and per package at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you'll say, what would resist the windows of clothing stores, looking for nice clothes for yourself and then try them all in a cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting at the entrance...
Continuous insatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to dig at least 5 pounds - should I start doing sports?"
"You like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of something?
Yes?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed by their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisoning.
The scent and cleanliness at first place
It's like an infinite manege.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, make the dust, disable the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make comments to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, the children that they sucked the washbasin, cracked the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you just suffer from this obsession, try to think that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be first in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sap
"Get this garbage used to the garbage."
"You're gonna put these old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this sap work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really disassemble it.
It's obvious that you don't think wrong you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much work...
Defamation, perseiling
Defamation, perseverance, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly concerned with relations and thus are happy to treat topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe everyone lets us escape a little harmless perseverance here and there.
The hand on the heart is, however, a particular feature of women.
But the worst is those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are especially dangerous in their surroundings - especially in the work of a collective of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in Philadelphia victory
The attacker Jagr took part twice in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again in the lead of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another move and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also recorded two goals during the game.
Hunting after the game told the overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the Flyers' first shot.
A second later, there was a second attack on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the palette and presented it to the killer Maxime Talbot.
Just a second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the League but he's really one of the three best," said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hokeyjist like him at the end of my career."
"I'm really happy with this."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in the NHL other team players have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," said Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shoot she ends with a difference from a goal.
Matt Read did not remove other complications that ended to two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He knocked on the palette, I took speed and (Read) went to the corner most far from the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," described the final goal of the match in his view of Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he went out as second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians did not face an experienced defender's advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the rear line was sick, which mainly beat the local coach rather than lost poles because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"That's awful."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest of them were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement this is not enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender participated in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in Uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost games.
How have travel prices evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was authorized to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have an inclination for the West and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not permitted for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovakias) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual journey was not authorized.
Travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the west, however, you had to make the queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for the currencies that was the condition to travel west was refused to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovakia currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (western currency) to travel west.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, the Czechs have experienced a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs spent 4 million holidays abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because of part of Yugoslavia of that time.
The removal of visas in the 1990s in the western neighbouring countries has led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakias could not travel by plane west for a long time that everyone wanted to see for at least a minute.
For example, in Paris travel organisations made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take his own preserved food, saucish, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists to buy freely Western currency after decades.
Our standard of living as well as average wages have increased, which has caused another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to an increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have begun to prepare tours with air charter connections since 1997 which, thanks to contracts, have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the EU that later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the post-revolutionary tourism history when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to the far-reaching hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development arrived in 2008.
on 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to be fully included in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 kronor per person for holidays abroad including the associated charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with a situation without a "pat" solution.
Almost five months ago, Czech football is without President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek, head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic, will not yet be known after another General Assembly to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on the procedure for voting.
Without this agreement it is not possible to begin voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the leadership of Czech football.
Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure called his colleagues to join together and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only in the era after Hasek the football returned back to differences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully apparent on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessaryly in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was no question of dealing with the way in which they were elected.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, is it, the statutary representatives or also the officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since this moment with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue to occur with regard to the election rules.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, did not bring anything to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nevralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round to avoid falling into the pat.
"The discord apples are the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," noted one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, representing professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third round wins that of the candidates who have received the highest percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes from both chambers will win.
And the Czech party is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which understands the objections of the Moravian party and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the election rules established according to the most advantageous statutes Pelta among all candidates.
"I wish that we vote as much as possible according to the association's statutes."
"In order not yet to have any sunny ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblys," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined itself especially against Pelta.
Pelta was optimistic.
He said in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone."
"Soccer will be again on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," adds Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in football leadership both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This can cause a blocking of the General Assemence again."
"I still hope that healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some reunions should take place directly in Montenegro, but that can say whether the entire football direction will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorise, among others, the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and was being sought for a variant to take part of the Executive Committee on the field of reprisals.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be crucial.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the dismantled parties within the strongest sporting association in the country and to bring them to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: a state staffing, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports that must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for President's position because he sees no correct candidate.
If the leader of Plzen's footballers had seen Tomas Paclik before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for for for a new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not be campaigned for this high-level function.
"If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation, it has not been possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT which would first be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also emphasizes that if he wins the elections, he would only hold the position of President until 2013 for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not linked to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be obsessed, especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Roman Berbr Regional Football Union, a man with the reputable opposite who is known in the scenes as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates 'the General Assemence.
For Paclik, it is unacceptable that Pelta occupies this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-vole trader, this would be even less favourable to football," said Paclik.
What still shocks him is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago during the hearings in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta managed without any pain.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of the UEFA and the FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen Club."
If Paclik triumphed with the Thursday vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly, who had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go with."
"He has great capabilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation."
"But as the manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik who in September attracted great attention when he spoke for the annulment of the Arbitration Board with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level of conducting the Association.
He is an example of his ability to lead private companies and that he has also been leading the Plzen Club since last year, which with his support celebrated his triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would inhibit the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to bad taste situations," added Paclik, who did not chase his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power in high-level policies would provide more money for sports gambling tax.
"This is one of the key issues that the new President should address."
"If it comes to the chance gambling tax as stated by the political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen Club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again bound with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"This isn't the ideal."
I do not see any reason to transfer my actions from Plzen Club to someone if I have to return one and a half year after," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future with the quarrels about the election regulation.
Jablonec's official is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the successor of the football representation today should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, prior to the election of September, who did not meet, promised that he would be dedicated to national representation and the acquisition of financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the previous General Assembly, and this two-month delay could allow him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily related to the Jablonec Club, has worked for many years in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It is also for this reason that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there was an euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Happyly at the June General Assemenced, statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone saw."
"If there weren't all these different interpretations, we would have had a President since September," stresses Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take him as a personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities in the event that it does not work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he strives, said, not to confront his opponents.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he knew clearly that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who, on the contrary, continues to criticize Pelta.
"He has evolved in football for a year and has already had some successes."
"However, his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That is also why some now have doubts about its character," said Pelta to his opponent but remains," he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to national representation.
This should be a football window.
"And I would also strive to complete all the business that begins with that of the Bohemians or the follow-up to the scandal of corruption."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said the 46th candidate two months ago to the Czech Press Agency CTK.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not result in any change of people.
"I should be acquainted with all employees," he told Strahov where there has been an understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"Soccer needs credibility and he will only get it when a new leader is in his head," as optimisticly Pelta states two days before the day, probably decisive for his career as an employee.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic at the Thursday General Assembly, it would not be much fun for many people, he seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the event of his election we will start working hard.
It wants systemic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with the UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a youth-performing football."
"But I don't say I'm doing this all alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute competences within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football is facing a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be a matter of starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is worth it and if I will have people behind me who will constantly put me sticks in the wheels and cause doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"A lot of people have told me that I should not give up because they would give up too."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he said.
What motivates it is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years, there has been a great work of fact and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to arrest them."He said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta, the situation within the Union will not come back as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who were playing football in such a way that it would only be for those chosen."
"We can blame me for a number of things, but certainly not to support any one."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only with those who have been chosen
And he reaffirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say the opposite, I'm ready to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts: one Czech and the other Morave whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel a support from the Czech Chamber that has elected me its Vice-President and knows that there will be successors with me," said Rajchl, who among his successors intends to save tens of millions of SEK on disadvantaged contracts, contracts negotiations with television and on the law on gambling.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"None can doubt Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would probably continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his successors," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
The Julia Stanek
Oven optical patrols, beautiful Budapest swimming pools: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or making a long walk - can let his legs rest tired in gasic water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went to search for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his bathing suit.
On her back in the water, she observed the artisticly arranged cups, and swims against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not miss to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau from these converted pools.
If he enjoyed a covered pool, she immediately noted all details of the type of construction and the history of the building in her book.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architect Meder and they presented them in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain). The municipal covered pools of Münich, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, " Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
It has led its trips to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe in 13 countries. Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old Allemande is a true fervent of bath culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sport but ell feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is annoying that the swimmers must simply look at blue tiles and accommodate the smell of Javel's water while joggers breathe the perfume enchanting spice forests or can listen to the gassing of the park's joyful birds.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools should actually always be so lazy," said Vienna.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
Dive in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "We have a water surface in the swimming rooms instead of a floor."
"It is transparent on one side, but reflects the beauty of the entire building on the other side."
All surfaces appear optically in a double way: high wings, multicolored tiles, tremplins.
The image volume of small format "Badefreuden" makes a 190-page report of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives the desire to jump in the blue.
The Meder collector discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (caverne bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath with water filled with alcali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbereny) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath you have the whole city in its eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits the swimmers in Langnfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths come from a sulphur smell, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba comes from a strong oil smell, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its limo collates you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath was designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902.
By looking through the window of the New Art building in red-white-yellow, she observed the spread of the weeds between the tiles.
It observed a opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Thermal Palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that came out since its design in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style wall room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its curious modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - not only because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance to melt construction styles so different into such a great unit," Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation of raw materials
The Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the group leader then wanted to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find that banks are inadmissible to speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions to stop this business path because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann stresses in this article that the speculation of Stock Exchanges on global raw materials increases prices upwards and that banks share their complicity to global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is practically aligned with the head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the view that the bets have separated from the offers and demands - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism differently from the American competitors: He promised to invest in the reproachs and said, "No case is worth playing the Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from the ONLINE SPIEGEL, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the Head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how today's banks are detrimental to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be under special obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"This doesn't matter, for Mr Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And with respect to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will care about it.
One out of two would eliminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires from 1001 people on November 7-8.
Only eleven percent found this legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one out of two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected in the raw materials speculation.
43 per cent would not recommend such a bank to their surroundings, 49% responded that they would consider the termination of their account to change of banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
Now it is again open and takes place as an exhibition house.
If you are enthusiastic for a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its vivid and audacious alloys and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer's flag for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example of this.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction of steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture until now.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bolt-shaped construction in Munich, he finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His flag project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suited for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for as long as" until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly depleted.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, now he has the name "Haus of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance shot in any way.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvédère gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth of artistic patineuse, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she carried out in particular the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established its exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, there is a coffee and a library there, and a office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realisation Krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and extended with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the flag was "a very important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost generosity and lightness as a result of his journey to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a boom in energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façades were changed, insulation glass reinforced into glass fibers was placed and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been restored.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a seamless light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The outer doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a color protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it was once.
And all of this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Most often materials that are good and cheap were to be found, and also enjoyed by the monumental protection office," Krischanitz said and he drew attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken the right conscience".
But in this case, the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is just the "Quarter of the Central Station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance might happen: the 21st century house could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the collectionist Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as he says, it is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the neighborhood of the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The Railway Society has developed a crisis plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the German Railway Society will spend more than 70 million more in this respect this year.
The "Bild"-Zeitung daily reported in advance by calling for an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about EUR 300 million would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and rail networks also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for snow-snowling of railway facilities and docks is expected to double and increase to 16,000.
The aim is to remove snow and ice from the docks until the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Rüdiger Grube Station Chief warned the government and industry at a summit conference on train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter, the railway society had enormous problems with the transport of users, because it lacks reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions among others.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing so for years since it has to make the axles of the ICE trains check significantly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles occurred on an ICE in the Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties to the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine to millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant of the sector brought it back to the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in comparison to resolve a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator has a whole series of accusations to large banks that have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimised risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and led banks downwards.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said a German Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any mistakes in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20,5 million.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for US cooperative banks and it intervenes in bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took part in other major banks and in the summer he assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents, this is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the American real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the summit of the financial crisis, the US Lehman Brothers Investment Bank collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at present it blows on the US banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have resorted to many remedies to obtain redress or to sanction infringements.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, both the US state property funders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for being in nature advantaged in mortgage business of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to appeal to the FHFA, which is a number of operations totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but not to quote a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the requests as unjustified and declared its willingness to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the gourou of finance, invests colossal sums in the IT company of IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares for a value of more than $10 billion.
Until then, the large US investor Warren Buffett constantly explains that he does not invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only reveals bad forecasts.
However, he read MIB's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier than IBM primarily offers services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the TI IBM activity grants itself the right to now call itself "Mr IBM".
Because Buffett has today revealed to the CNBC economic issue, which he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5%.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about this commitment until now.
He commended the management, which even during the economic crisis had achieved reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM has been used for some time on IT profit services as the exploitation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consultation as well as high-performance business calculators.
To date, Buffett had rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies he understands business.
But instead, Buffett is dealing with rail freight, lubricants or machinery manufacturers.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Back munichois.
This 81-year-old octogenary had taken over in the 60's the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had built it into one of the most prestigious world companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why it is a figure of worship for many investors around the world.
Its almost infaillible sense of gaining money made him the nickname of "Omaha Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a stock exchange value of a total of over $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media doubt the rule of German law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blooding ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectrum that had been believed to have died for a long time, has resurrected: since Mölln's fire attacks in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been mentioned.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions that are far from predictable.
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology," "it was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Constitutional Protection, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the bourbier of the far right.
It was reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of the door of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a fiftieth anniversary ceremony of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that the cohabitation had been set up, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a whistle: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself from unambiguous conditions.
This is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The police's action was viewed in a very critical manner on the German-Turkish forums, and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in some suspicious circles of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one is at least ready for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be blurred, there will be nothing left to migrants except self-defense and arms."
"this will be the best self-defense."
"Inland peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says Selen.
What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has more clearly shown to the Turkish people living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could result.
However, the attacks have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past errors
In the past, this was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes the Turkish people produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows how far the mistrust of many Germano-Turkeys has been deep in relation to the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of greater clarification and reassessment of extremist-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandalous bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the meantime, the UBS has almost bankrupted in the financial crisis and has gone from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; we knew in July that he would occupy almost as spectacular a position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Great Swiss Bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and profitable career.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recent solidity, and made lovely comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS succeeded the Turnaround."
"I am pleased with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything would change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had misleaded all of the Bank's security systems and had burned about EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the Board of Directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been considered as suffering - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the chairmanship already in May - not in 2013, as announced by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At the same time, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "the largest bank with scandal in Europe".
In fact, the UBS is huge on one side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been pating for years from one scandal to the other.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also rude, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of bank for many years in Zurich tells: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"On the current point of view, we wonder how I could simply have been mistaken to that point?"
He's been deeply wrong.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not turning around with the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli retired surprisingly, which until now was considered as a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later, we found out why he was gone.
The bank division had flamed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this, she actually found investors, but soon before, they would have sprinkled the eyebrows: an untransparent Asian state background from Singapore and an Arab state background, which was kept silent, to the point that its name has never been learned.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008, this worsened.
The bank had to announce losses to billions again, the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second best paid board of Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State in view of its investment errors.
The National Bank has purchased tens of billions of problem securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds that can be converted into shares, for which it could become the co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to shelter from so big banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the 2007 UBS increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said the bank researcher, Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with America and declared ready to publish the easy customer data, which might have fraudulent the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a $780 million payment - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
For example, UBS has published more or less that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the Head of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, in a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And as there was a little return to peace, and as we thought, that the UBS would get out of it, he followed this unfortunate history of title merchants: only one title merchant flares EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank realises that something was not turning around.
And it is published: with investment bank risk management this still does not seem to work.
"With the case of Adoboli, risk control has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, Economist and Professor of Finance at the Bank Institute of Zurich.
Therefore, the financial director of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it has no control of the risks in hand."
However, this was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had taken their role for a long time, that of becoming a guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too high risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power station in Zurich is still in conjunction with the strong cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at the central station of Zurich, which leads directly from the central station to the lake of Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings are prestigious here, store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliers like Tiffany's, they are found here between the Swiss tradition stores as well as those of the Sprüngli confiserie.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have stayed here: from the national bank to the Palace of Credit Switzerland to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the UBS entrance hall through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, front with thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day gone out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two major banks.
The UBS would have become far too large - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the moods of Anglo-Saxons."
This was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debase: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country with the seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," says Lukas Holign in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to CHF 68 billion, or EUR 45 billion, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank has been created, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and has recorded an increase constantly.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have complemented: a rich, but letargy bank with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former President of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has moved to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And Wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
It's a tragedy, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group has always pronounced the same word of order: detach Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already been successful.
In foreign exchange and securities transactions it played a very important role.
Business advisors, who were responsible for this, however, stressed a weakness: in international interest operations, in the bank jargon "Fixed Revenue", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have shortcomings in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched an adventure, which almost cost her life.
Assisted in growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in US sub-prime investments that invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and transferred value documents based on US mortgage loans - but which has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
"Also in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The greater euphoria the more brutal the fall is.
One manager after the other had to leave, when one of the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been banked.
He who runs the big bank has a practically impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, has already an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, to focus on property management, to return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go that far (now).
But the investment bank must be atrophic, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday, the bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present its future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was only expected to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must conduct the business of the UBS lastingly, announced the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has certainly already raised.
He said publicly only so far that he was going to get an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American stock exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week has discouraged US investors.
The change in government in Athens and Rome has remained without impact.
The jugulated industrial production on the continent has suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief for the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be required.
The euro has fallen from the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half-filled last week, not half-empty - but now the problems are again pressing at the forefront," said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
Default Dow-Jones-Index values recorded a loss of approximately 0.6% to 12.078 points at the closing of the markets.
During trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.
The S & P 500 index more widely closed at 1251 points, a deficit of 1%
Nasdaq, the technological scholarship index lost 0.8%, and ended with 2657 market points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries significantly reduced production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Statistical Office, companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month.
American investors expressed themselves in a skeptical way: "We are not an island, on the other hand, dependent", said Steve Goldman from Goldman management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession; there are also other signs of weakness from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview in CNBC.
Therefore, he was too early in his view to invest in obligations from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett has thrown an old principle of decades in the wind and entered the American technology industry
Its investment in IBM of more than $10 billion supported the course of the shares of this traditional group, and allowed it to note almost over 1%, against the trend of commercial management.
The paper almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett claims to have paid an average of $170 per piece, and now holds 5.5 per cent.
The price of the share of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3%.
Bank of America's shares have sold to 2.6°%, significantly higher than the market.
The house invested almost all its shares in the China Construction Bank (China Construction Bank) and removed $6.6 billion.
The institution intends to maintain the company's net profit, including its capital ratio and thus meet the most difficult regulatory requirements.
Boeing increased his business and therefore limited the losses in the Dow.
The shares won 1.5°% after the company collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates Airline ordered on Sunday 50 long-courrier aircraft of type 777 and estimated the value of the order to $18 billion.

Smart horns spread in cities
In many places, frogs are considered as "bird problem°" But experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been hunting towns for a long time.
Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. Horses have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are growing because of dirt and animal noise.
An antidote against the "° problem of birds" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on the horns, the experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the breezes of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors were also based on the exodus of particularly protected frosts: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional living areas.
Hunting, designing and slaughtering typical deck trees made life difficult for birds.
Horses are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 deck pairs in the Westfalischen Soest, in the northwest, including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertising due to the massacre of corneals in the region.
The critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killings with particularly brutal gourdins.
"Normal expedition, evasion, does not serve anything," said Werner Klöver, the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer.
The destruction of nests by means of pressure water or the shooting of trees often produces undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they spread in other places."
The evasion can only be imagined in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, pensions or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer destroy them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Convincible is a combination of the evasion of animals with aversionary packaging and hanging offers, to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "from info panels instead of sections" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-educative movement of corbs in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent frescoes.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a large number of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Frogs do not only use work tools to get to a fun but make their own tools as work tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four frosts, how much bird intelligence happens.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to cut a shovel with stones to reach a larvae.
Without a lot of training, they were determined to recognize that a stone should have some size and shape to break the platform.
In a second test, the clever horns then had to solve a more broken problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small fence with a larvae.
The birds could not reach their butterfly with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four bulbs are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo draws Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turkish ones remained unfit.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland purchased the last tickets at the 2012 European Championships in Poland and eliminated Ukraine.
Under the direction of the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal turned against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the eliminating return game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been one obvious thing.
Nothing was also burning in the 0:0 game between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a release 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72e, 82e) and Miguel Veloso (80e) marked the other shots for Portugal.
The former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11-metre penality (41th) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a double shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted with a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the finals for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
In the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free shot of 30 meters in advance into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of Manchester City's English championship, initiated a headball directed below the crossbar, the balloon did not cross the target line (33rd).
Jiracek made a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, the Arbitrator Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark granted a 11-metre penalty played with the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably differed.
But, after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion succeeded four hits and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will be a fifth time at the EM.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the legendaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
The goal guard Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a final minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked at the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shooting.
After the break, the crossing must have come to help the Czech world class guard already killed, once again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his seat on the bank of the third of EM in 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth tour in the final European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan marked at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even enter the balloon in the purpose.
After the time of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic from Dortmund at 62nd Minute, the Legionaries of the Danijel Pranjic Bundesliga (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, Irish celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the coach's team Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already supported with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32rd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed to the higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last time that the defence of Estonia has been able to prevent a possible goal of the first killer.
It happened in the 32nd minute.
After an unsuccessful defense of the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and will tighten the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, approximately two billion dollars (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, said Tuesday the Dax Group.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," announced CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the 176,000 global SAP customers are located in this country in the full expansion.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
"Now, we want to expand our activities..." said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War (The Beauty and grief: an intimate story of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that crush your heart.
A tip to start: carefully break this page and make it your page brand.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a tag during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the storms of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book out of common that he described, accurately, as "a book of anti-history."
It contains some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could look like." It finds the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and sorrow" summarises the experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women in wartime, both sides of the war, from young schoolmen and botanists to climbers, through doctors, ambulances and vendors.
Some of us will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war will lose members, become mad or lose life.
Their lives are swaying here like the cemeteries of a church: while some turn out, there are new ones.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It brings a dementia to the idea that the First World War is merely summarised by the terrible war of the shrimps on the Western Front.
"The beauty and the sadness" describes skillfully other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and Eastern Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under bars; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as an Hurricane Katrina who smells the cordite.
When canon blows are coming away, and you are a mother at home, are you staying or fleeing?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been overcome by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and mourning" follow individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English infant in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high-sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives may be terrifying or passionate, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
By telling the story of a German student, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, überall ersatz. "
"Replacement café, fake aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dried roots and dried skin of potato; wooden shoes seams."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. 511 substitute coffees are also found."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own pulse towards wildness and says about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a hand whiskey, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather claiming that such a vernis is synonymous with civilization, and there is no barbear behind your shirt emptied and clothed.
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of death, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are told to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have a public," he writes.
Unfortunately, this is quite comparable to "a man who is strayed in secret".
Other comments relate to the decline in an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," says Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the beast of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his slaughter while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; they find as much basic behaviour as heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of the soldiers who have tried to catch a Venetian disease in prostitutes to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most important expression in the trade in pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genital organs in the hope of reaching the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate ones apply it to the eyes, which results in life-to-life blindness."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostating, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasped how war "launched exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People begin to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works that deal with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) by Paul Fussel, or "In the West nothing new", by Eric Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most aggressive I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had gotten out of his book, seized your hands this page with the list of people and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a thoroughly planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some wearing anti-robbing helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all other than a few high-ranking officers as well as other informants from the beginning when they were going to carry out an exercise.
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be any repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gases against demonstrators, which have gone against the department's regulations and have caused a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared by observing the course of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organised on the island of Randall, for the operation at the Zuccotti park.
Police officers receive better training against rebels - anti-terrorist measures that involve moving rapidly a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last training session took place on Monday evening on Manhattan's side of the East River.
The orders given to move into the park have reached "at the last minute", said a habitual person, referring to the operation as "one simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who have been called did not know that they would go to the Zuccotti park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city was able to hold a lesson, which is why the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park, but were dismissed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces throughout the neighborhood - from dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Vehicles of emergency services equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages of speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While the community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue winds, many demonstrators simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was touched before 1h45 declared the police, which left the occupants time to gather their business.
Other police teams were surveyed on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were needed.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman of the Chief of the Police Department, stated that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, severely held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved west through the thick business searches of demonstrators, including luggage, plastic lawn and bags of sheets filled with clothing, teams from the Sanitation Department followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people in the middle of the camp were hanging together.
Finally, two people were chained with trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the cadenas.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 a.m. Mr. Kelly said.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about one hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "intelligence in public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the site.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, "not conducting operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were patienting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a pasture of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expanding the perimeter far beyond the Zuccotti park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, would even have been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on a police car's capote. Others were seen killing the tires of a police truck.
At a time, a piece of plates emerged by flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union continues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school aid who lost their job last month, plans to bring a city trial on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory redundancies. The impact is disproportionate for schools hosting disadvantaged pupils.
Prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, among the least paid in the city, lost their employment on October 7th. The union leaders compared these dismissals with political revenge because they did not allow the city to access a health care fund led by workers' groups, which would have allowed the budgetary gap to be closed last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott stated that the redundancies were part of the budget ended in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the 37th District stated that they would complete a notice of claim, warning the education department that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution of the court at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the defendant party. The complainants will be represented by eight redundant workers, all black or Latin American, as most of the school aids who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the City's Legal Department, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints received by the New York Times, the union would focus on the number of dismissals in schools in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there is no dismissal on Staten Island, and a few of them in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa establishments, 17 school aids have lost their job in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern districts of the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight students in Harlem's public school 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution states that "It is not a family district that can bring funds to fill the budget shortage."
The 36 public school budget was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each registered disadvantaged student.
The union also states that school directors have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "passing" to describe the action, even though "passing" more generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of workers available whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parents coordinators were dismissed," and "not only because of overrun".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement in Capitole on the question of the revolt in Libya.
A successful revolt, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi and American involvement would have taken place.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "money".
"This resolution is to honor the Libyans' courage while they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's a bipartite support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators of both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill has been defeated by a broad bipartite margin and has never been voted in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the funding of US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress was upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of the Congress was overrun by the events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "declares the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "declares the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June last year?
The senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
In the Capitole, the House has to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution in order to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and a few democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte, Virginia, will constitute the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have not yet succeeded in approving their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both to the House and the Senate - and others are slightly different from one previous one.
At least 15 versions of the amendment are included in the House only for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who want to have their CV - the chance to be "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) approved last August requested the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is constantly proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the rejection of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposed.
As greedy as Members have been to propose amendments, they are not as fast as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 amendments at the 110th.
The cadence slows down compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massaced but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords at her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to recover rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared in the 20/20 television newspaper on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Gifords fought to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show addressed his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and penetrated the left side of the brain, passing through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and singed - and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, replied "a lot of good".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during an hourly special edition of "20/20", which was released the day before the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special broadcast has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the shooting of January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he was seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on the front.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach him to carry out simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "what."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper " Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, said that he did not remember the shooting.
According to his husband, he was reading an article on the shooting of March 12 when she stopped him and asked for information on the six people killed during the incident for the first time.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and treated vigorously waiting for the trial.
"There have been many deaths," Gabrielle Giffords said to Diane Sawyer.
"High, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you haven't been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, recover and get back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-sleeved rose up at his feet to accuse him.
"The soldiers, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fundraising.
A high-grade military present in the gala, in which admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of the United States Army Staff, also participated, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a kind of orphan," wrote the high-quality military in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just compassion.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the military and a passionate but often remote American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of unfortunate spirits."
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to seem unreasonable or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of the troops coming back from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on compassion take place in every secret among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service in two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to remote areas.
Others would wonder if "a angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface" said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who made him go through the interviews were subtlely asking if he would be able to keep the pressure on a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return to the battle.
"When you address the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions," reminds Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the soldiers arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely commended by a country so unfamiliar with the army and sees little direct benefits of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," says retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a military.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army faces the increasing pressure of sevir against rapers
This week, a major hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her bar at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texas has put away its concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught him from behind, thrown on the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will with anxiety await the decision of justice in a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial against the former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rapes in the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, an attorney from Washington, the trial involved 17 complainants at the outset.The number was 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming that they were sexually raped or abused by soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's taking care of the galooned soldiers, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in the position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?"
The lawyer also stated that since February she had been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - so placing all their eggs in the same basket - she will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defense Team, for the Department of Defense, headed by US lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, called the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged wrong is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicate the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not, officially, have the right to go to the battle, this distinction is only recorded on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male only.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
Result: Of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in a battle situation.
It is time for the army to modernize Susan Burke.
She is not alone in the fight: three more trials are under way in addition to her own.
At the Yale Law School, the veterans' Legal Service Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies for so-called encouraging a misogyne atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "difficulties of personality" attributed to victims of rapes to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network (Military Women's Network), a human rights group.
Her group held a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual aggression in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a two-party mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual aggressions were recorded according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office).
But it is well known that the number of sexual aggressions is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of military cases were subject to trial - half of the percentage of civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the military police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, at a trial during which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her aggression.
Six persons witnessed as a witness of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was delivered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander, "This was not his trial, it was mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was returned under less honorable terms, preventing him from receiving any advantage.
Whether Lyman and other complainants will progress or not, this is a long history," says John Turley, Professor of Law at the University of Washington University of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward".
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a judgment.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of dissuasion posed by responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it is important that they try," he adds.
These things only change when the right ones are willing to fight.
If the trial does not turn for them, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
Monday, Breivik, who recognized that he had been taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on the cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who supported the extremist groups on the social network sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a report recently published by the DEMOS Thinking Group on Digital Populism in Europe.
Facebook is filled with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - how mercaticians have done so for years.
The team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that half a million members were fans of extreme-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the advertisements invited users to answer an inquiry. The questions asked concerned their level of education, attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 extremist parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But astonishingly, "they that associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new tool that is essential in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers and politiologists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", wall publications and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users that add on average three contents per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work with the site's name in the title of almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their exploits in a state of bride had far more chances of being alcoholic than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to assist a student whose status would speak too often of alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," says the Washington Post, Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behaviour and Development of Children at the Seattle Child Research Institute.
"We know how to identify children at risk and who would not be recognized in another case."
Facebook also constantly accesss the information of its users.
The website's data-dealing team has studied statistics on the situation of love and Valentine's Day, the participation rate in mid-mandat 2010 elections and a national happiness index (with only information available - the champions of digital freedom have for a long time supported that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like or not - in exchange for playing the Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of kilometres away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard about?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think a large number of users have already thought that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchange was only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a note block and pen remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": the first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to have organized the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a "fighter of resistance" when he first appeared at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templiers," he explains in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"When it comes to the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as organisations supporting hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, forbid him to speak to the media for four weeks and advised him that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind the bars.
All participated in the hearing to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian NRK television channel.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made a little progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
With a dark costume and a blue cravate, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes by entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance movement", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he had acted with accomplices.
So the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it is not," said a parent of a victim.
"This would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the movie this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computers.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent interview by Steve Jobs, which will be broadcast this week in first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the processes and flows of product work.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram amplifier - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "maladie allowing them to think that a great idea made 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits with Steve Jobs for more than an hour for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It is only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly raised, is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast in the movie Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose technological philosophy and its commercial strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments in which Steve Jobs' perfectionism resembles, where he seems to be impatient to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to speed it up and move to more important issues or topics.
Filmed before Pixar's, iPod's or iPhone's era, we find a strangely precise aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and presents his own vision of the future of computers.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and must be.
He explains them and then puts them into effect.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to lead a business:
"In all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do it.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details of his efforts to simplify accounting with Apple.
Curious about how the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" assessed in the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that ensured the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour in the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells about the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to pirate telephone networks and phone free of charge.
The device has been the subject of many writings in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of ownership is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, by passing one call and connecting from one AT&T network to another while passing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened a minute later to you on the public phone next door," says Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something capable of controlling billions of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't both know much, but we could invent a small thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by making himself Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are convened in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About his love with the technology (and the demarcation of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, while hunting spare parts to produce a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and calls him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and that formed my definition of a company and how employees were treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever designed desktop computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathodic tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was returned to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On innovation improvisation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head hit.
At the beginning of his career, while moving to sell a few printed circuit cards, a client asks him to install a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to deal with the assembly and delivery of finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... I was screamed on it by pretending that I needed five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and which would be incrediblely reliable.
On large enterprises that breathe:
Long before he returned to Apple, Steve Jobs anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to be wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you worked at IBM or Xerox, do you do a better copy or printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet any more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are those types of people] that ultimately lead companies and product-speed staff are put away from decision-making.
Product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is completely ruined by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have done ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They cut off the defeat at the victory.
About innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to make... some things you can't do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them to each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. This is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists copy and that the great artists steal.
We are always ashamed of stealing excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas are having dinner with opponents of health law while the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court met in a closed house to consider the question of political dispute, namely whether the opposition to the law of President Obama of Health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner sponsored by the Office of Lawyers who will defend the case before the High Court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the issues concerned was a trial by 26 States that challenged the ambitious health care reform voted by Congress last year, a law that was a focal point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5.30 p.m. is expected in March next, and the result is likely to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer who will hold before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the United States General Applicant during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément's legal firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen cabinets that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federal Society (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and declared opponent of the health law.
The guests are staring at dinner?
It is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend collections of funds from legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be an intervener, an honorary guest, or appear on the program of such an event."
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the firm's lawyers, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, has been sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and having dinner and collecting gala funds with lawyers who have cases before the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds from this event demonstrates any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general applicant for the administration of Obama when the first objections to the law were brought to the Court of First Instance.
Her criticisms pushed Kagan's reluctance to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in law defence to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for line aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-line aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinarily about a company receiving an order viewing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, this is a whole case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Just as amazing is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that in the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing announced on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that is flattering with significant fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
These six aircraft amount to over $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Analyst of Morningstar.
"These clients in particular have an enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in oil prices.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their orders from aircraft when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The command of Emiliats strengthens Boeing's predominance in the big carrier aircraft market and helps to stop the attempt to empti Airbus competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Fair arrives four months after Airbus announced to postpone the starts of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is backing up its starts to increase the push to increase its load capacity and autonomy as a result of the demand of its customers.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to reach $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President manifestly beaten at the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governorship race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access the office of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was the leader of the race at the Governor's position in that West State.
"The intervention of the organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon at the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electorate officers... they picked up the urns, installed road barrages... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only had a few Calderon, who was in the lead of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidentials for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denounced any link with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a Mayor of the NAP was murdered while he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates abandoned the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as Michoacán's elections seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare themselves to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two economic powers with the fastest growth in the world should "do everything in their power" to accelerate recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He disadvised BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "different eye" and reported that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would avoid" a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all together in this crisis."
"That is why anyone can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point, but it is not safe."
"But if China and India can help, nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously affected by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has been dangerously raised and the Prime Minister of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has caused fear that the global economy will return to recession, and has called on the main emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the IMF would provide all Asian assistance, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as purchasing the obligations of the United States Financial Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a declining rate of foreign capital arrivals.
"Person wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the dozens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to make Europe receive assistance to 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800,000 lives with $2 per day, or even less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the euro area could lead to "significant effects" across Asia.
BASD forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He reported that emerging vulnerable markets needed to develop "relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leaks.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defense Reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budgetary compressions would undermine national security and triggered a financial reaction in the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already digests $450 billion in discounts for the next decade, but is now afraid that an additional amount of $600 or more compressions will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"A significant reduction, thus applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously affect other modernization efforts," says Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send unpaid civilians to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously harm our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect the fighter troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the financing of the accounts of foreign contingent operations in time of war is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contract staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts supporting war."
"Salary staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defence.
"The result of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader of the military power."
"We are strongly opposed to this draconian action," said the senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when the letter of Panetta was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the United States' national security interests, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and senators' recent warnings increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest Pentagon position cumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without seafarers."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of casernes, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed, unprepared force and unable to deal with potential opponents."
"De facto, she invites to aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "produce significant operational risks: timeliness for response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage us in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could go to the cutting, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the Navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion of savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to Identify a Lie
A look at recent sleeves indicates how deception and lie are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is busy sharing allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The directors of Penn State were accused of betrayal for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone stating to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsions of countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the famous Anthony Weiner Internet, turned to an idiot by rapidly emiting denials that were controversial with irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of those who lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term on her sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legionary.
There have been cases where teachers have given students the answers to the tests in order to give a clear overview of their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many frauds do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times within the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone needs to acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, let us say, charades, where the aim is to write: "I have had you", the detection of fraud is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research into such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of research is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
The liars look in your eyes.
They don't always begay, reddish or worry.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to reveal.
A qualified liar detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro expressions, question formation and time of reply.
I have spent several years reviewing scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge on fraud, and it is clear that detecting fraud is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hire, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled to read the others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know, according to research, that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centred on them" while women say more "centred on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbelievers, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you say if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "record data".
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Observe the position of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally hangs his feet permanently in order not to launch unfair charges when you see him hanging his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for clues of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviour.
Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of fraud.
Deceptive people can stop the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, bend to an exit, change position significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated suction of relief, a change of position when all difficult questions have passed.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview response.
Also, be careful with the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson diverted using the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a remote language: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Somebody can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember property... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magical formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by robbers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be derogated after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - encouraging the anger of trade unions while relaxing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project to put it on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it would move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive zone of Nebraska dunes, and it was confident that the project would nevertheless gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitole of Nebraska.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, claims that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This is a result of the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed its support for it.
The 2,735 km oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would transport 700 000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do so, six States would have to cross it.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to oil pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed this plan put pressure on the fact that a law forced the removal from the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing Environmental Impact Study of the Department of State found that the project would only lead to limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation from the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor for Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle was prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit of fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a violent decay in the hall of their Manhattan building, frightened their little girl to the point that she vomited.
The drawing of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, so that she suffered "personal change, sleep disorders" and "an increased fear of foreigners," said her family during the trial of the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 of last year when the stage technician Kevin Monk, his childgarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève, prepared to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and laid her daughter for a while.
"A man came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes," and I went for her," she said.
La Belle has angryly called the pregnant woman.
"She told me about an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "What you say or think I don't care."
She became mad and began to use sworns - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling me with the bottle's water.
She said that Geneviève has become hysterical at this point.
"I said to this woman, "Behold what you have done to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who still held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings who trained her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for apology from LaBelle, but received no answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims undefined damage, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family is considering giving all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with a mother teacher carrying a child of 18 months."
Climate adversity has hampered the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations of economic advances, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange for a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, apart from causing billions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy for growth, caused a decline in economic activity in general by 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, one 78.03 per cent of which suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main damaged crops were vegetables, corn and chicken peas.
The decline in economic activity generated, up to November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate of the State during the first three quarters of the year was accelerated, since while from January to March 55,000, 053,053, were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate of over 74,000, an increase compared to the first half of 18,000, 969.
Decreasing liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to public policy actions.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a limitation of resources by the law approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally, it is not easy that they work to win them, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Emigrants
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment was also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who abandon the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, first because of the entry difficulties and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people are staying here and asking for sources of work, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Deficiency of seriousness
The analysis of the salalon labour market is worsening in view of the high level of seriousness that predominates between the working conditions, according to INEGI, the 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state is working there without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for disparity for the state is the low wages, the entity has the lower wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Labour Secretariat and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the Sinalo workers was, up to September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011, the highest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June, the State EDI reached $630,000,697, which represents a decrease of $87.74 per cent compared to $5 million 143,000,312 registered in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total of 17,280 billion pesos per year, registered mainly by tertiary companies.
Debt
In view of the economic downturn scenario, the Government of the State requested the public Congress in July to approve a 3 billion pesos credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos, and until November there was no benefit from debt in any sector of the state economy.
Responses
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all, and above all the already synchronized progress of this new government team, hoping that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and have reduced its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including freezing, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn quickly enough to generate economic dynamics that allows for an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefined vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, the president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that work has been done, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefined the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be explored," he said.
Much to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He reported that the current administration has shown advances in the manner in which public policy was managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much has been done and the Government is aware that there is still much to do," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor of the Republic informed that the small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale, for health offences.
In accordance with dossier AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trader was operating in a pick-up-type white-coloured truck, in which he carried a black-coloured bag in the vehicle bag and on the seat of the copilot a small backpack where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted is still at the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Delits.
Debts on contributions to works
Works of a social nature that are viewed in programs such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 migrant para may not be completed where serious delays due to the lack of economic resources are recorded, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development stated that although the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation, since the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He reported that the total investment of these three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State had to provide the 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything, even though they had to give us a part since July," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, we have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration Municipe had to apply for credit to cover the 7 million which the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to work, and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we had to obtain resources to cover what the State had not paid," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had done so requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything."
The Court validates "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digitals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has debushed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Deputies have expressed against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analytical cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was debushed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the statement of the decree as non-constitutional because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of the reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and of all its actions for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also decided to support the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the draft of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he disagreed with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures through general standards for public administration to prepare for them.
"I also consider it only if it was done to affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the State's leadership.
Replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years, and this results in better radio spectrum use, better signal quality and more channels.
Sustaining change, he supported, would delay the benefits of digitalisation, which involves a decision of public interest which has not only a technical dimension, "for it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "requires the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership of the State, comprises a group of powers which the Constitution grants the authority of the State's Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere that the laws issued by the Legislative Act are respected.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" bill in Michoacán is analysed.
According to the data identified by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verbal reports.
The possibility of "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the election process this year in Michoacán, where, according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6000 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Elictoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, last November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán has not approved either its Constitution, nor its Code of State Electoral or its Law of Electoral Justice, while the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for the entry into force of this election trial and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish it within the time limits provided for in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Authority and described the vote of the State's representative for constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because he did not have the right to "sanctify or challenge".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that, thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM, it will be possible to achieve the partial and total decomptes of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the verbatim minutes are not coincided; there is no ballot record and counting in the Urne file is not with the President of the Minutes; or there are obvious errors or changes in the verbatim records.
In addition, the total counting of votes received in all election urnes can be made if there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the respective election and the second position in the election is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total ballot billing may also be made if, at the end of the joint billing, the difference between the alleged winning candidate and the second position is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party of which the candidate was released second, in which the electoral packages which were subject to the partial billing will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where, according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the Serra of Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his native city, Sunday to night, and Monday the people will present their tribute and there will be a lack of requiem.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last will was that his ashes should be spread in the Serra of Zapalinamé.
After receiving the tribute of others who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on the edge of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the guard chapel of the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where the family and friends visited.
At 5:30 p.m., he received tribute to the Technological Institute of Saltillo organized by his former colleagues of the University of Technology and the American football team that was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the University of Technology.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes were spread in the Serra of Zapalinamé, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the driver's sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, an extraordinary, a loving brother and healed his family a lot."
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the town of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he had even a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parents' graduation, he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last goodbye
With honour, we said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who was the leader of Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, Directors and Students of the Institute of Technology of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and other six people, all staff members of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the eplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and masters.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented the media to eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered with shots in various parts of the body and with grace, in a abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of the road from Cadereyta in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the color beige and coffee the portal was broadly open.
Looking inside, at approximately three meters, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with breezes.
At a distance of a meter there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were stretched on the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because no shells were found in situ.
In the closing of the property there were legends directed by a group of crime organized to the other, except for a few ball orifices in the property and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the Cadereyta municipality and considered to be related to sequestrations, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and illegal inhumation.
According to the information published, in a first act on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 6:00 p.m., military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting and carrying out an inspection, the soldiers found a long weapon, a loader and 18 cartridges.
Eventually and after these statements, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the soldiers.
They are assigned illegal burying in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The Prime Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country at the edge of the economic disaster
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy at the forefront of the economic disaster and has put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats in his majority, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the President the outcome of his discussions with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well traced," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy has fought a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to impossible levels to support.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets at which the performance of the Italian BTP bonds was placed at 10 years over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The opportunities for Monti's success were greatly encouraged by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis forced to resign on last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will be a good result," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central-Left Party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because many of its members have so far opposed Monti's technocratic majority government.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added to the pressure to observe that a bankruptcy in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started consultations with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He will finish his tour of meetings Tuesday to night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short delay at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the cost of Italian debt has now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite general predictions on the fact that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that mutual mistrust and disagreement among the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is higher than the experience of the costumers
Of the 22 soccer players called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of 22 convened participants participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast with that of Costa Rica, compared with the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friend at 15:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, record a wide register of class A inter-selected games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on the last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain intense activities in national League and Cup Championships and European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition to all this, experience with Furia Espanola must be added during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football World.
Costaric footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be lower in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a cérébral driver from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA on the side of the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front center of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Centennial loan is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costarian side, and near Michael Umana, there is the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the killer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five passed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even arrive at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still beginning.
The historic killer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 wings, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the largest recorder, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of track
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality."
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream of happening in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its tour of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its unique stop in Central America.
That day will be present at the National Stadium, from 19:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet.
For his costumers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far this has been great.
I spent only one holiday in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it feels like we're wearing our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, the fans live intensely in previous days.
What's your message for your most loving ones?
Thank you for staying next to us for all these years.
It took 21 years to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we are sorry that so much time had to pass to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit.
Some of the larger shows we have offered over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered two gigantic shows to Sao Paolo, and we hope that this will put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, on the side of Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the kinds of surfing that love.
Seeing the tour, you avenge offering huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's this to do?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we haven't interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of course.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you succeeded in?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock group, and the fact that we have done so for more than 20 years makes this seem to be a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us feel a lot.
We love each other and we love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to form part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them again and it's an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups last normally.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we are all concerned about the others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If you don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that you have to respect music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that you are famous and a rock star, which is not really interested in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we didn't publish a record before Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that she lasted so little and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
It's true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose her for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the group we loved most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and this must be very distractive.
For what do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings her and I think he's doing it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the grunge in spite of the fact that the grunge is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, this reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening and groups like Mudhoney are now doing the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change to do?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deep dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music, and these songs, probably, represent that for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle force he presents in the pies, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is sentenced to 25 years of prison for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various diseases, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, probably, he said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been performed four times language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been solemn in the National Operations Special Directorate of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army extermination squadron that was illegally operating during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political links
An official cortège, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, and formed from various ministers and managers, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda distributed by the Uruguay Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax paradises in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax paradises, a declaration that resulted in the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of emerging and stronger developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "gri list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not include all international standards of tax cooperation.
As regards trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, a Free Trade Treaty (LCT) which has increased the trade of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu piper passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at everyone's stores, has been designed from the beginning to fully exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the person who has to say how to work stereoscopy without glasses," said Nintendo's specialized press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid part.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second tour" at the level of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between a "Aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "do not fall to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which was no longer happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a glance to the saga supporters and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu plumber must go through mined platforms of danger to release Princess Peach.
Even if I find new things in movements, environments, costumes and enemies, and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom accepts Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for $70 million laundering.
Thus, the trial ends so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that requested Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeyed the independence of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his mandate, "he had not helped" in no judicial resolution, and he had taught all extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former 2004-2004 mandater.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after solving its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the diversion of funds from 120 million Q in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial preceded by extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a risk situation
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition, the long hundred jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The birthday served yesterday to record in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping low-skilled people, without work, with problems of drug addiction or marginalized.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of corporate and institutional leaders who have worked with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, demonstrated the unitary nature of Trinijove's work.
At the side of the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act by the former Minister of Social Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor of the Mayor and current municipal eco-socialist Ricard Goma.
Also attended in the large Fabra i Coats Chamber the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove an example to fight bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for its work," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fees, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of Street 51 Balmes lived ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned yesterday at noon the building that they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-fees that desperately were the neighbors, in legal order and without a need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From this day there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took up the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues in any way, especially alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the mass party scene, which lasted up to two days and desperately renters.
Beside the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business declined a 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unloyal jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational facility had had to respond to complaints from neighbours about noise, while, according to the latter, the problems were not caused by the discotheists, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially the participants in the festivals held there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors in the area.
The director of the discotheque explained that the problems were so big that she even concluded an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months that the owner "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) has also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The president of the municipal PP group of the mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week for "immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of common life and civicism caused by it to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular director explained that before summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "you must end with impunity and be unpleasant against anti-social behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday, too, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond the polemic on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Towards the mid-80s, in the middle of Barcelona's already-sealed Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large metropolitan park of Barcelona.
In addition, it also included a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, otherwise up (montagne) - down (mere).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is at the best of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park unless Yellowstone, with birds in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door returns to the park idea, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a theme of the discussion of all architects in Barcelona.
This is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this old caste of elects speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, academic professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is opportune.
For Roldán, after dealing with the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green houses, has not been completed.
"We have to go from the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," gave the judgment the architect for which the title of "collserola doors" contains a "lexic trap": one should not think of these "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action must be done".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual defi" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and which had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overrun.
"We need to think of new urban and planning instruments, as current (referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (MAP)) can cause genuine disasters."
By addressing the question more, Modol opts that, by simplifying, the river of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, Barcelona's, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronate which "does not be lost", thanks for the opportunity that the mayor offers its company to intervene in this "from the first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the superconductor that architects can enter the debate, but "just" if this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams ("all success," he said) that we had to create: "We, architects, should be just an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because base of the competition is lacking a comprehensive vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 transverse competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole."
This means, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project to allow one of the doors to shock in the program and definition with the architect of the neighboring door.
In his view, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately exceeds the band of Ronda de Dalt should, throughout its extension, provide for a area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal power foundation of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second District Penal Tribunal, which follows a trial for extortion against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic quot for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the illegal operation of the gaming house.
After the public declaration, the Attorney-General initiated a criminal trial against the brother of the Mayor of the PAN, and on 2 September the Attorney was arrested and held in interim detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry of Patrimonial Delits, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the Capital of the State.
He stayed there for the following 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the official of the Department of Public Affairs debushed corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Penal Centre of Cadereyta allegedly for having singed with a million and a half pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention centre because there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a capture order was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as that relating to the cashing of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the founding of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could recover his freedom within the next hours.
During legal formalities, the Department of Public Affairs attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who had been associates of the gambling house who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197/2011, legal forgiveness was granted to Jonás Larrazábal and later no claims could be made in respect of the trial against him; no compensation or punishment would be requested.
After the hearing of the founding of the legal power of the game house, at 15:50 p.m., the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he was legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate order of freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome communicates details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven persons lost their lives
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (TBS) informed that the results of the accident that has been identified by the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the aircraft launch, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had various contact with the ground, the pales had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements necessary to carry the staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search, it has been reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has been structured.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a gap of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Helicopter of the State Major Presidential was operating at speed to cruise, and this happened on a rising soft ground.
"This information supports the assumption of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, identified six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The ICM reports indicated adequate conditions for starting, and as the aircraft progressed towards the DF-State border area, there were low-high nebulity layers.
Selected Routes:
It is likely that, due to the nebulity conditions, the crew has sought a lower height area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact, there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a right and side path.
The aircraft's residue dispersion model assumes that the helicopter has encountered the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
There are always no traces in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground had a slope that went from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated himself during his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impact with the ground.
After thorough searching in a larger area than the surrounding location around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which bears the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by NPI specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetics of obesity of children and adolescents' protocol, which will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the 20th Century Medical Centre, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Advanced Research and Studies Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the people who have or are not entitled to participate, to present themselves to the IMSS participating sports units in Valle de México, where juvenile evidence is made every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Sportive Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity took place in the Sportive Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independencia Unit (South of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (North of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this research and the research knows the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identifying risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on November 14, the World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family inheritance history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or renal impairment.
It detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin, and genetics (research is sought to identify people associated with infant obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation was the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years ago, there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity in boys and 47 per cent in girls; a dramatic increase in overweight was also observed," said IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the other by its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent inheritance in India, 30 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in Africa, and this is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics are reflected in the inability to bruise the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which deposes itself in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows to determine whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-coloured folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of metabolic and even pre-diabetic changes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the doctors give it to parents in writing, to which each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tams - meat pasta with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fat and protein and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Department of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rain season in the Mexico Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, UNAM's Researcher at the Department of Chemistry (FQ), who has assured that if the construction and maintenance process of the pallet pavement is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even completely eliminated.
During his conference A technical opinion on cassis, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for it develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Mrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve efficiency, and consequently, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier share of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphalts, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavee its viscoelastic behaviour characteristic.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, is acting as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes broken, added it.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, advises the chemical engineering specialist.
The researcher of the QF observed that the streets of Ciudad de Mexico, in their majority, were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Between the more surface layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compressed later.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, signaled it, is bathed year asphalt.
When vehicles pass there by generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, only the chemical ingredient.
On the asphalt layer, he said, a last layer called the rolling layer, made of fine stone, i.e. sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the efficiency of the asphalt layer.
When the floor wets, the water spreads inside the layer, it is difficult for it to come out, which ramolates all the layers of the paved and therefore causes cassis.
In the process of formation of a cassis, he said, the first thing that blew is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for cassis formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pad must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent cassis formation.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still a lot to invest and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What has missed Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Sera not obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her Princess Number 14 title.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she was on the winners' stage, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico climbed with the crown and the sceptre, the department already sums 14 titles of Princess and Melina one to a legion of women in Valle del Cauca who were near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she was not elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visage Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor in the jury's decision to designate the First Princess is the fact that she has not convinced with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? written by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer from Valle's candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culture, finally I think that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Glow of Blood".
This answer did not take first because of the term "culturalize" and, secondly, not to explain in concrete terms how each quoted book had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what should happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Between the assumptions made there is the one that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the areioned and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the Oster gastronomy defi, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "this raised the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the scene."
And this was noted in his first presentation in bathing suit at the beach of Hilton and his two parades on the eve of the crowning.
Even though she had appeared certain of herself in the two parades, she was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of Magdalena's and Atlántico's representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program (As at home) of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who receives most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the Queen's crown."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another assumption is that Valle has failed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
For this reason, two days before the election, Lucy Doughty's international jury said that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculative that Valle sins because of his defects from his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury chose him as the 'Natural Goodness' candidate with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen's preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina had not the best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which had actually not been too famous for me, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that the mistake of Valle's candidate was her surgical interventions.
"The surgery is good, but Valle didn't know how to do it.
Her body has never been her asset and it has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Beauty Competition for the first time, after the bathing dress parade emerged a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that it was a little gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
In reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, otherwise as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her glorious passage by Cartagena, has not obtained the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopist passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On 4 November, a Cali ITC dactyloscopist passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the towns of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he was transferred to the capital of Valle and, following appropriate courses, specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he went to Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla of the world, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical appearance, because it was very different from that he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian wolve, ink, a lever and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't mislead him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the responsible person who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the chief leader of the Farc.
Looking for the fingerprint
For a dactyloscopist of Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don't know our job.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science, without a margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying the bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the prisoners.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher noted that in a flight case he had to remove part of the wall from a house, because in this place the thief had pushed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint from them, but in this case we have been able to get the fingerprint from the whole hand and identify the offender who had taken part in various flights," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man with bottles of drink around him.
By termination of the investigation it was determined that a parent may be suspected of a crime and in fact a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if this does not guarantee that he is the killer, it places him on the scene of the crime.
An ITC dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a lifter or tape is used to remove them.
Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the expert from the ITC.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that you touch does not forcefully become a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators smashed in front of the Zuccotti place to camp there.
A large number of people reached the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday, trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, in the place of Manhattan, from which they were evacuated in the dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators blew in front of the Zuccotti place, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows the 'indignation' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place again, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the Occupe Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the 'indignated' response to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived at the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that banned forced evacuation from the place and allowed demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignes' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, the property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for one hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, ensuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had been handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved as a sign of support to members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police.
In the meantime, Zuckotti Square - which is a private property forum - remains closed waiting for the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analysed.
Some displaced demonstrators carried and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time, and they even handed it over to officers who watched the place, which caused 'some small confrontations', said Bray, who declared that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to demonstrators, but he warned that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal adviser personally defended the evacuation carried out in the morning at the place of Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the demonstrators 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt others," because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning in the dawn was reluctant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "doing no respect for freedom of expression".
The leaders of Occupe Wall Street also indicated that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Noel television program
On the side of Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will go out to the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", helper in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program by Noel of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, next to the "krooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will come out into the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV has distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive dissemination on the Internet of a private pornography video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the beater of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crèche a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian Canadian comedy who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared to Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato, and is not far from the controversy itself.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returned after the earthquake
GDP increases 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the Nipple country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have weakened.
After three consecutive quarters of fall, gross domestic product data between July and September were used to turn the page definitively: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualised rates.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami afterwards.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of non-interrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the keynesian pulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use deficiencies to grow of zero.
Japan has awakened mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased a 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the nipple currency - became one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors who flee the debt crisis in the euro area and the United States' predicted disorders, a privilege that weighs as a dal in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fleeting line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, made the yen contribution responsible for their low results between July and September.
While markets continue their headquarters in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not reduce custody.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," noted yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the points of influence of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are slowed down.
Because it has dropped four decimal points up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even been below the average, which is at level 100, no lowering eight decimal points up to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says that adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainties reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to embark on the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday said that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period set in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not under no circumstances support the new austerity measures and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date, that of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday, which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samara's message no doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more."
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8 000 million that Athens urgently needs, and said clearly that he will not approve any letter of commitment to the implementation of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still annoyed by the impact of the whole referendum in Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambits as soon as possible".
The spokesman of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasises Spain's "predominant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-wide predominant place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this "essential" cooperation instrument, which is a "instrument for social advancement, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in human beings".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-e World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with certainty that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, in particular, in that which aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with income under one dollar per day, to which the "poverty line" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the original initiatives and inputs during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "to guarantee the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women," the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "performed a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" should be impulsed.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that 100 million of these families are coming from the poverty threshold in which they live now.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world " followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of combating poverty", the work she has known for 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I could see a continuous evolution," said His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifying "family leader" meeting in Valladolid from the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her intervention by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and seeking solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Etiketical Imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethic imperative" for any democratic State.
In this sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not leave it the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "success" to give "confidence" to people "excluded to whom everyone closes the door"; and Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors to the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President with universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor, but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but was imposed in the fall, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government policy too laxist with the Greeks today and perhaps with the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted by almost unanimity.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing of several minutes, to which Angela Merkel was entitled after their speeches, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The Chancellor's idea-master - and the motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control of the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission to universal vote "in order to give a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the twenty-sept will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also aware.
But the foot is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected, with a overwhelming majority, the proposal to weight the weight of each country at the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which of course meant strengthening the weight of Germany.
The Chancellor, with a desire to relax the climate within her party, multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither did she seek to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in the rapid difficulties to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollows.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon army.
What does fraud represent at sick arrests?
After the allowances, the PUM and the government are launching the offensive on disease stops.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund, and to give a speech on the theme - repeatedly since 2007 - of combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a willingness to make savings in a rigorous context, but is not less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease stops.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government intends to impose a fourth day of deficiency on private employees before taking care of a workout.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a sick employee would lose four days of salary, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that may cause anger, but would be able to report EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another, more symbolic measure: impose on officials a day of uncompensated deficiencies in the event of termination of work (they have not yet had a deficiencies period, compared to three days in private).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also revises the theme of fraud, focusing this time on abuses related to workouts.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will refund," advised Xavier Bertrand at RTL micro, Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud at work stops.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have been most frequent.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million daily allowances were granted in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economy Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sickness arrests, i.e. € 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of workout, compared to 17,8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any days of sickness arrest.
Another study, this time of the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the disease stops were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are not more inclined to work stops than others.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for or without health reasons) in France oscillated between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at sick arrests represents very little in the face of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it reaches only a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on disease arrests of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long" or 37,050 cases.
In cases of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of "inappropriate or unjustified" cases of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169 000 cases were "unjustified", out of several million employees who had been sick.
A figure that represents a very little face to face, for example, the figure of black work.
According to the MEP Dominique Tian, who wrote a report on the issue in June, it would represent €9-15 billion of lack of tax earning a year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus infinitely more than fraud.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said in Parliament on Monday, 14 November, that the hundred days given to his union government would not be enough to carry out this task.
"To continue economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on confidence voting in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area is "in question", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos anticipated that the country's government deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis on Monday, but warned that his party would not commit to an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with Members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
At Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not deliver the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
There is a need for legalization of euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and take arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
As a result, experts quote a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicinalization or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, reports experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, this is the highest rate in Quebec, with 86% of the deaths in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is no wish to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or descriptive, there is no evidence that such descriptiveization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted in non-competent or non-consent persons.
On the contrary, yesterday, at a teleconference Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatorie of the report, there would be more cases of these excesses in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Uthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will help end-of-life people mitigate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia does not have the effect of sending the message that the life of elderly or disabled people is less valuable.
As for persons who have committed suicide assisted, the surveyers are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, said the authors of the report.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that the Criminal Code indicates that the withdrawal of care for which a legally valid refusal has been made is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee calls for it to be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme" because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would have been over 18 could ask for help to suicide," said Me Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But "in society," he said, "there are tags and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "manifest pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular contests the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bachar al-Assad protested yesterday in front of the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures were intensified yesterday on Syria of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a position in favour of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria where forty civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar had the heart of his country's interest, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the leader of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had been a failure.
"They who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country against which Turkey is adopting an increasingly tougher line.
The United States, on its part, welcomed the "building of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are taking an increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime have died in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died in the city of Homs, according to this NGO, where "shoots and robbery were exchanged with heavy guns in Jobar".
At a press conference, however, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem considered that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly responded to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' work, which he said was a "hazardous step".
Syria "does not flake," he added, ensuring that "the ourdis conspiracy against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also supported the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is locked in "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from cities prosecuted for the contestation and release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, held yesterday the Arab League's decision "incorrect" while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time on the markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "offers", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before he met today with the trade unions and the patronate.
It should establish a relatively limited cabinet consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews, after meeting the designated President of the Council.
The President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to apply for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude by the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list, probably one dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that markets will be patient and understand".
Its appointment by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government should last until 2013, the date of the next legislative process, he estimated.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti committed himself to working in an emergency and for Italy to "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman from Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance in 2013 despite the last few months' budgetary aid plans, has, in particular, requested further rigorous measures.
The Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country without growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "temporary change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and a "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of her team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid premature elections, since Italy must place 200 billion euros of state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear weapon-usable detonator, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in nuclear risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely produced in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before he returned to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA mentions "high indications that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system" was "assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only well aware of this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, worked on this technology for the most part in its career in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or slowly, according to FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49%, compared to an increase of 13% of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the human rights organization Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," says Paul Legendre, responsible for the organization.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, saying that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" enable to follow more readablely, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the Internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, told the AFP the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, known for its little instinctive operation, with some esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) opening up to a broader audience with a more comparable approach to Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users suddenly discussed the interest of this innovation "tweets".
"It's unnecessary, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity will help me to track some elements of my Twitter stream better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
enshrining a budget "or rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Socialist/Christian Alliance in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any degradation by the rating agencies of the Austrian sovereign note (triple A).
It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision itself following a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros more interest every year," argued the Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the summit of the euro area member countries in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "regulation".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of GDP each year and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets at a balanced level.
The objective is to move public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threat of new intervention on the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Nepton authorities would intervene again on the exchange market if the yen would continue to climb.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate," said Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yens against dollars to lower the value of the nipple currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 in the face of the green ticket.
But the yen has since been regularly raised, dominated by purchases of investors who consider it a "refugee value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was recovered on Tuesday under the 77 yens and the euro descended under the symbolic bar of the 105 yens, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yens and the euro more than 160 yens.
This flare of the Nipple currency is a threat to the archipelago's exports because it cost the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the foreign revenues from Japanese companies when converting them into national currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild" since the earthquake and the tsunami of 11 March which destroyed the region of Tohoku (North-East), stressed Mr. Noda who feared that this declining yen would kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power has relaunched with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound of the exports and consumption of households lead by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the love of the yen was not "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for his part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, has warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", indicating that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuer institution increased its Treasury bill purchases by 5,000 billion yens (€47 billion) and increased to 55,000 billion yens (519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on the purchase of various financial securities to enter the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the rates rise, the stock exchanges flanchent
The risk of contamination of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are getting a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% at 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gives up 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the returns of euro area borrowing countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from the renewed fears of market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has riveted eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This regain of concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 hours, the European currency is worth $1.3570, with 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she declined after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting at the Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to get out of the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy's and Spain's borrowing rates remain very worrying.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds at 10 years of age is 6.85%, the return of Spanish securities with the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti called for time to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task " of his Government.
Spain finds itself in the market line, while Parliamentary elections are held on Sunday.
The rate gap ("distributed") between 10-year-old bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new higher history.
In attente of euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3% increase in household consumption.
The Insee, however, reduced the second quarter figure, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it is really the fourth one that is most concerned with the economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m. while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must take it over dogms
If it is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the impulse of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is safe that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place that nuclear power holds in it.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction in fossil resources will need to be tackled in order to continue to produce continually electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate deregulation, a missing topic in the environmental debate.
Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
It is neither the case of Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which just intends to build only last generation plants.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to mention them alone, are continuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by reintroducing the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
While the German model, focusing on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality upset the speech.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence by increasing the use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a rush in CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these bad effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
It is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of the French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a gauge for maintaining industrial tools in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power would result in a significant increase in electricity prices, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest a fundamental opposition to this energy, the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has led to the construction of an industrial sector of 125 000 direct and 410 000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of SME specialists in international markets and makes them very creative of non-relocable jobs.
If France had just decided to get out of nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the amount of EUR 6 billion per year of French nuclear equipment and services exports.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it should be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity, nor is there devil.
The development by Areva of low-emission CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Safety Authority that exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing plants as well as on the Flamanville yard.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited with the same security obsession.
In the half-century, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions and remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgiving human errors caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the two previous ones.
With this approach and cooperation between safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to take leadership in the indispensable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the "emotion, dogma and partisan manoeuvres dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles -increasing the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" of France.
More recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students has been the topic, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talents, maçons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrants", and on the left, by Michel Rocard, explaining that France "can't accommodate all the world's poverty" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish plumber hordes was shared both on the left and on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity given to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande cantled to banals, indicating that co-development will solve our "migrant problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paying for election, but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent paper summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Reducing anaemic immigration to growth and to the detriment of employment.
The fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants are at risk of replacing national workers, particularly those with low skill, who are under pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in reality much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly working in sectors with shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job supply.
Positive effects on wages
In the same way as a surgeon will be difficult to work in a country with a lack of anaesthesia, these complementarities between nationals and migrants have a positive impact on national salaries and employment.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows results in an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a 30-year-old immigrant in Germany will make a net contribution (minus revenues) of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets for his/her life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, by dissuading immigrants, have had the exact reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember that, for inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the twentieth century the tragedies of Great War, totalitarisms, holocaust, goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some might have believed that it would be enough, in order for democracy to finally triumph with its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was a ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the necessary condition and can even become a "instrument of oppression", as the republikan philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is just as and first a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the real-false Greek referendum would have had the value of double revelation: the need for a powerful return to politics, but also the alarming feeling of its impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overrun.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have been displaced today, and that for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to make to demand a succession of national referendums, organized at the expense of needs and in scattered order.
A white-seing at the absolute European monarch or a foot jump attached in the vacuum of the nationalist replica: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts but a common exercise of right, peace and continuity, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is bound by the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
For it is together that Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to a disaster.
After long struggled with this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today demands the European economic government.
You're calling.
But thinking it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The revolution in interest could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe in economic terms.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
Chip cards "without contact" become generalized
The world chip card fair opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The 2011 year is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to over 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart's firm.
The most important segment is the uncontacted technology that allows to pay public transport or to settle its purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million chip cards without contact should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million one year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and account for almost 10% of the global market for the chip card (6.925 million cards).
For a long time on the back of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe wins land for contactless payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards without contact have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double stitches.
Carrefour thus issued this year 2.5 million MasterCard cards without contact.
To move to the higher speed, banks now need to team their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically spreading bank cards equipped for contactless customers to their customers in the future," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology that is essential to conduct transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should finally know a real growth next year."
"We are tabling on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in the world in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a box allowing payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front spreads
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
Long-standing, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algeria now has "certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without any further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation on the arrest of two French people in Niger in January last would have brought about the bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their ravisers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the decay of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the past calls is directed towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), two numbers are particularly interesting to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a bow of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It's a step forward, but we probably need to wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It is known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
Over the past few months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and speeches or in its operating methods, which now involve the use of more and more complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, therefore made pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of low-interested illuminators.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in hausssa "wester education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emigrate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
She politises herself and demands strict respect for the charia while its activists engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter first concern churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on the police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Therefore, the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, and another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram still took his first suicide attack to the police's secure QG.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, when the Somalians of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said ready to share all the information.
The world according to Republican candidates for the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, or even simplistic ideas?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied tonitruating statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on assistance to Israel, the slogans - often unsupported - were fired.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for manipulating their currency", a theme in a America exaggerated by the migration of whole parts of its industry to Asia.
He said that it was so pissed if this meant the triggering of a commercial war.
Jon Huntsman, former Chinese ambassador of Obama, and only a candidate for a vision of sophisticated foreign policy, almost outdated against an attitude that "flatters" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stagnating in the depths of the surveys, remains inhearsable.
On the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he fanfaroned."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations towards this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered because Beijing "shoots to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was prepared to engage the U.S. army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy car in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the overhaul of Iraq's "boys", on his tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking a weak label to him.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population finds the national security balance of Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden, rather positive.
Since Iraq, she has been distrusting the military interventions that lead to the seizure.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more fairly.
Nord Stream, a new Russian gas gate in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting West Europe directly to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, entered service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with joy.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated, last Tuesday, on the edges of the Baltic, between orchestra and end buffet, in the inauguration of Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia, under the sea, to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the pilot of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube connecting the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklembourg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already referring to the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and hour of this huge yard has a winning look.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossings through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to the Western European markets.
In the strongest of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare Nord Stream with a "new German-Soviet Pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Staline to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
West Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater security in its supplies.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe of energy, as the project has created a break between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to triumph with its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, with strong gas consumption, and its deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this gas pipeline, showing how the major gas contracts are as political as well as economic.
All this explains the wide smiles shown by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical exploitation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete steel in order to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, mine fields from World War II had to be avoided.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
There was also a need to increase measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts throughout its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but the project leaders abandoned it, while the Swedish were unwilling to see a Russian state company permanently established outside their coasts.
"In case of injury, we stop the gas passage in less than one minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes from the air.
However, this is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welding to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device operating inside the gas pipeline.
From the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a metre of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of trip at a speed of 3 seconds, he provides precise information on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo any repair.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have united their forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this company for 20 years of renewable gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by the shareholders at 30% and by banks at 70%.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach €7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment rose to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, since Gazprom alone assumes the risk.
The Baltic gas pipeline emerges in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine.
Ventiles with a height of 4.5 metres form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskin wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours past to write in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognisable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its broken white leaves, as old-fashioned by time.
However, the Moleskin book as we know today was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, at the time decided to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The booklet is based on an old production technique, the mole of skin (muffle skin), which refers to a laminated cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of book was very pleased with writers and travellers.
"Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, up to the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who became responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12,7 million out of stock.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 carnets were designed.
Moleskin crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a buyer's robot portrait, because the notebook attracts businessman as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskin, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now accounts almost 100 and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the libraries, from Fnac to small town shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the growing emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskin: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Enjoying its success and its cultural will, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer boxes... The brand falls on a wide range of mediums.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled persons is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the total population.
Discouraging?
"No," stresses Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people. "
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable. "
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as three.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It must be said that for disabled unemployed, many obstacles remain before access to employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of the 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled only 10,000.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled persons, compared with an average of 38%.
In short, so many criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment, and which are "the key to the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help firms recruit disabled workers.
This is for objective brakes.
Rest the unnoticed, the mentalities that evolve, though, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the respondent managers have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of wheelchairs, mental or intellectual deficiencies".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as set out in a 1987 Act.
The latest known figures, dating from 2008, reported a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Let Happy"
Before confronting the Blues Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly game.
We're not going until we write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sit side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker on Turkey, the Belgian selector has only to praise him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward," assures the Lillois on his side.
As for the contrast between his club and selection services, "it is a whole thing, has it been justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year long, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Meaned against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brilliate".
However, without ignoring the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been endured," he says.
In the past, this will contribute to further strengthening the "special" character of this meeting.
"There is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) in front of him."
"We met earlier."
"Power to play against them, it's just happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens referred for his part to "fierty".
"Feeded" to argue "a game of gala."
"Feeded" also to note - in the name of "who" - that France has "become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a job of thunder," he was enthusiastic.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blues... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians become big," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be aware of this in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimistic its dam back to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On his way, the two teams had lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, whose mantle he has been in since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debuilt.
In view of the game going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appeared obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, although it has not been able to mark this so precious goal, which would have relied on it.
"This is a good result, which, however, involves a certain risk because we have not marked a goal outside"
But at their homes, in their Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public that should be here as boiling, even though the party of course declares itself "very tight", a tenth of an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," still relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The non-reported Friday of Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero can be enough for Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"This is a good result, which, however, involves a certain risk because we have not entered a goal outside," regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
Like Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order to "do not give them time to think."
That's a good idea, provided that you're realistic, this time.
