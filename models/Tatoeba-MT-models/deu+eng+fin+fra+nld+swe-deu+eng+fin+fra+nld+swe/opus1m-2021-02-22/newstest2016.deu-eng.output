Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
Both wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the Middle East of Tehran.
However, the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement building and rejects Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The deal about the Iranian nuclear programme, which Obama has called for, has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech, which was partly valued as an affront against Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, and a meeting had rejected it with reference to the upcoming elections in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call Professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat trembling voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was criticized for a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to cancel it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This stood in the letter, according to the authorities, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular historian professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Officer Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the bad emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police put him in.
One day after the shooting in the university, students and lecturers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get an idea of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching bodies comprise 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time there were some inclinations to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to hire as an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trace when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He obtained a PhD in Pedagogy in spring.
One of the long-standing friends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's swarm at that time.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together some time.
In the emergency call Lamb said "I killed my wife", but there was no document of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the bakery house that borders a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-wife of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail showed up on a summer yearly market three years ago.
Later they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night on September 5th for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonica game before a scary audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Simply a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candlelight commemorative celebration on Tuesday evening, including lecturers, employees, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the alarm guard while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The course will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect the fact that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call Prentiss called his wife, but there is no indication that the two of them have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to employ less workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the Toy and Baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers who are currently working with him a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres all over the country. During the 2014 Christmas season, 45,000 workers were recruited.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start calling for applications and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business moves closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat is empty next to me, and I'm gradually aware that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes me think that I'm a simulated tooth and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" was premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "unquestionably the largest time travel movie ever played."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his answer to Russia's reinforced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the conflict lasting for almost five years, and more weapons will only worsen violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Chief reiterates its call on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the USA, Russia, China, the UK and France - at the margin of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "resolve this situation."
Ban called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria as they have demonstrated in the conclusion of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 surveys that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to mark him as a flop.
Others took him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a crash.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top lines at surveys down, it has (now) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump to lead in the two-digit area, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course it is still too early in the parliamentary period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain in 2011 at that time, of which no one won just one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But external groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and start to flow their dollars to crash it.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not only a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidateship in mid-June, a survey from the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six Republicans out of 10 have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfactory" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "irritated" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unhappy" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election country of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think he has the personality for a superior commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not pass into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they put their scientists' guards, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who the best wins the GOP nomination, after a CNN/ORC survey last week four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten late July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a variety of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans says they've formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given up their voices.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was a turning and fishing point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six Republicans out of 10 say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump will seem to do so.
The frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC/Post, they prefer to have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "helveously annoyed".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - overlooking the North Seawatt.
In the street, an average square metre of a Reetdachhaus costs 73.300 euros.
"On Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - that is, the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a studentbude in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residences, one of the prizes occurs like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residences - with square meters prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix per square metre, well-marked.
But well, who can afford...
By the way, Munich may not be at the top.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double Torschütz in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller opened the way to FC Bayern to a earned 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in Pireus' witchhood.
The team of coaches Pep Guardiola won their start in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes Treffer (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th launch in series is supposed to be the first step towards finals on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
On his 28th hit in the Champions League, Müller received good support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made a flanked shot of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavarian captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31,688 hot-flowered fans - and the Munich spoke.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus won his latest six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
However, the Bavarians, unwinning in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often in their offensive efforts to work unconventionally.
The attacks were too often initiated by relocation to the left side of Douglas Costa, which rarely suffered against the former brownish Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank hit from the right half field in the left upper tower.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos storm Ideye Brown beat the main ball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct removal, the Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to play a dominant game, Piraeus could put needle sticks.
On gatekeeper Manuel Neuer was trusted.
For example, when he directed a shot from Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before New, Guardiola had a four chain with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the frame, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero had given green light only after the final training, Sport manager Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Who wants to make something else from it, that's already evil."
In the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters Müller put one more on it.
Before the game, it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially mutilated Bavarian fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the followers of host Pireus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and met with strokes against the Munich followers.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever smokes hurts not only the lung, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam's long-term study.
The good news: If you don't give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smoking, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early to 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammations of the dental flesh, emphasises DIfE.
For this parodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and dental loss is therefore reflected in more frequent smoking dental inflammations.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries.
But people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years until the risk goes back to the level of non-smoking," said first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
One must convince people to become non-smoking, said study manager Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens lifetime."
Do not smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads, according to our findings, to good dental health up to age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, DIfE reported.
Earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supported the findings.
Archaeologists encounter residues from the Spätantike at Cologne Rhine
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made at the right Rheinufer in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated Skelette and remains of historical buildings," said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological ground monument care.
In the third phase of the Rhine-Boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents had already been known that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery was also discovered with about 350 graves, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman is crashed at the station in Gerienkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
In the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the track from the train station building coming at the end of the train path and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, the Federal Police said that it had the most serious injuries to it.
She was medically treated on site and brought to a hospital by rescue forces.
There is no knowledge of the cause of the night’s crossing of the young woman’s tracks to the investigators.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inhabitants or Passengers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) will be requested.
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided on a 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police at the telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
In order to resolve the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private settlement bodies for disputes between groups and States are therefore to be resolved by a more transparent system that is clearly more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to create a system that the citizens trust," said Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
The Swedish woman intends to incorporate the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU Member States and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are intended to come in the same parts of the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, it is also a second instance.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
To date, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitrators, and there was no objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of the last few months it had become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, said Malmström.
In the long term, it wants to work on an International Investment Court, according to its own information.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved there.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) required mainly by large groups are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, which allows companies to challenge damages at the expense of taxpayers, eliminate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact identified the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
In the reform, the Commission took into account key issues that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, had developed in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned against limiting the opportunities for claims to the economy by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, he said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be established at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer sustainable.
Delicious people of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with filt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells about various places that he always recorded on the map, about which his minuscule and tenderly arranged songs report.
Where they were born and what it looks like, in his homeland.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative insult.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", smart composed songs appear, which are harmoniously close to the American people of the late 1960s, but can drive into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor is that "Michigan" would be the first part of a shifted series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be consecrated in a row.
However, in 2004 and near Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks some positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live enough for him to guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a comprehensively celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overflowing in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard Charts and does not miss a yearly list of the most influential music media.
After very productive experiments, Stevens uses very extensive electronic counterpieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
At the end of the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of Neon front bands and large fluorescent stage deco.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring through Germany as part of a five-head band.
In the darkly held Hamburger More!
He presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now banned in their chairs, Stevens, which has become much maturer, returns to privacy and people.
Without giving a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience you hear: The lecture is "opulenter" and you can throw away the "plate in essence".
At first, Stevens is modestly thanking, playing acousticly few older songs, and finally reluctantly applauding.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's Debut is expected with excitement at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, is to give his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and to join David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and the Labour Members from close.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it will be a member of the shadow cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour President's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national hymn's singing at a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several title stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn drew attention to himself
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he was "in respectful silence" and he recognized "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national hymn "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences also "steep" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow-work and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, who has been Tory Chief, in the last decade faces the dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour President, who promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and he has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontative, and that he will be abandoned both "capacity to strike" and the fight with reversal and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of the Minister of Economic Affairs will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also brought the idea of other colleagues taking the floor occasionally and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house, in order to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to get rid of politics in the style of a "Casperle theater", which is often linked to the Prime Minister’s Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
As it was first sent on television in 1990, the question time with the Prime Minister was considered to be the most important barometer of the judgement of a leader and of his leadership in the lower house and of his position among his fellow Members of Parliament, although critics argued that it had become a cartoon and needed extensive reforms.
'Schossen in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hard place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn life.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pfund increases by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased steadily after data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. At the same time, the FTSE 100 was increased by the bidding target of SABMiller.
Between May and July the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and made estimates of the date of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20% after the acquisition offer of the Rivalen AB InBev had received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were, according to encouraging news from the Contest Group for Luxurious Goods Richemont 0.9% higher.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - re-listed growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5%, after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi Packaging and Paper Group were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company rating to "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company reported an advance tax result of 46.6 million for the six months.
The manager of JD Sports says higher wages are at risk of expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappic 21 years young, a hanging with supersmith fries.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
It's even more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them is Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7:00 a.m. the pole sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Buil: Here you live Idol, whose poster is hanging up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much on the day as her mother Ewa deserves in the six months.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my wiktoria should be in the tenth class in the gymnasium."
"I'm fulfilling her a dream."
School duty?
Who's joking?
The fans don't.
Even Bieber not.
He's done it anyway.
For the advertising in the ad break of the Superbowl he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company was washed many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the laden table, Bieber also cashed.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you'll be surprised at the window.
It's supposed to have been more than 100 million years ago.
Some say the hype would go too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally in the USA and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is scheduled to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does that.
Pegida poster brings Lebanon to Cartoffield Idea
Potatoes or dönes?
There are both things - in the cardoffeldöner, which Oldenburg's bishop owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the proverb "carrot instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
The idea was to bring him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "cardboards instead of döner", which he had randomly seen on TV.
Since then, there has been a grill spit in his store, which is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculty for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by Lebanon at the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a model of use, according to the Authority.
How much meat and how much potatoes the spit contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of peoples is also good for its customers.
Metcash launches soil resistance campaign to combat Aldi infarction
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA files from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a land-resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Ice Manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and store owners that sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment implements its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, since South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after the opening of its first markets and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and the market share will decrease from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told me at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it's supposed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operating debt reduction while at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler fights and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week and improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's CEO Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop sanification programmes will be put to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, called "Special Ks" again and again, came into the light of the famous dispute between Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterward, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, and Harrison cried out, "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While the last time he was seen to smash a tennis fighter, after a cramp destroyed a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Healy's coke kineaks were firmly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in detail behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup Halffinale against the UK.
"One thing I'm pretty busy about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a fighter when he lost a cramp in the US open, but he's not the first player to break a fighter out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he was extremely good in the US open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important predecision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term firm component."
"First we wish the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think that Nick has managed to get up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He gets into the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get into the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-one country and Serbian officials reacted with anger.
The people who had fled from violence for an unknown time stuck in a landline on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants scandalized "Open the border!" and screamed insults against the Hungarian police of preparedness.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it was "inadmissible" that migrants were sent back from Hungary while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a partial damage.
There will be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbia border came one day after the 28-nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels, which did not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in overrulling Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year would finally reach an agreement that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an early action of Brussels or of its neighbours.
The emergency reported on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country was also planning to build a stack wire fence along his border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it had completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison residents were used in the race to create the stachel wire zone between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant obstacle and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, make the crossing of the border or the damage to the high fence of 13 feet (13 meters) that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," said Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still needs to agree procedurally on the military's use, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that the authorities had 45 people in the attempt to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by harming the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
The authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train wagon with stitch wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to enter them.
About 20 were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advance before Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
The former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advance in the democratic race to nominate at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 per cent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 per cent (increasing 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the Presidential Office, receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has won some profits.
Clinton holds a great advance among women and imitators, but these advances have decreased.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind here.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under the age of 50 has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, has a great advantage with the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit advance with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advance with this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it was nominated by the party.
One quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiasticly support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become President (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval to deal with the problems and the choice are also quoted.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the Presidential Office in the Waagschale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden's second choice would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's advance before Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election, but this number has fallen by 78 percent in the past month.
Biden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees him as "the most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about voterability.
As in the last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-elections proves to be unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features of voters of their party's pre-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts off the three candidates best with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leader.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not think of him.
Democrat voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
With all these measurements, about one quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked as Foreign Minister during the term of office, most democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views overall.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unsatisfied with their statement, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them under registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also regard Trump as unhonest and unreliable.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good scores in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut best with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather as honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre-election is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson returns to Donald Trump at a country-wide survey
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump with the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates now represent half the support of voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatic stops
Republican voters continue to support Trump in a large number of countries. Support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson arrives well in demographic groups and exceeds Trump with higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is rising in the surveys - he lands with 19% support to the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising up last week, Trump found some sides for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologised to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Although peaks are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is expected to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some don't go into the sea anymore: up to 18 degrees of water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, says the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, however, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic region it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College newling
Nearly two years after a student died during a shy ritual of a student's connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, mortal charges are filed against five persons.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed.
Officials said he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became dizzy and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and Andy Meng, contact the national president of the brotherhood to seek advice, said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"On this point the members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the brotherhood in principle over Michael Deng's," said police officer Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with dumb force to head, chest and thigh injuries.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the horrors of the brotherhood. At least one student dies of the horror since 1970 every year," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be made accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury from Monroe recommended a third-degree accusation for the first five members.
Twenty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of the brutal attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to make the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or inofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also take them to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership in the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the houses will be swinging, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long this all takes and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to raise interest rates, but rather on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement might have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "good money", said Julian Jessop, Chief Economics at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a view based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the past month, the prediction of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend that asset returns will be shrinked 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said German banking analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the Fed.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, quite flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal condition after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4% according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Head of Investment Stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that were not before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy in this regard that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to the Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic scene could be risky and raise the question: "Is it different this time," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have focused all year round on an increase in the interest rate of the Fed, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many streets and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this session, the futures trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all growth cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with increasing growth in GDP and pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of recovery," says the report.
On the other hand, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far from the longest that Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond ends fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The streets of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer backing of returns between longer and shorter bonds and a deflation of the curve.
High-income bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still cautious to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
In general, companies operating most of their business in the United States will benefit from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as an increase in the dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most," Goldman said.
Beyond pure shares, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts are different about how quickly this will happen.

Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he does something that the private broadcasters do not.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station should be "double" and no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "double" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples in which you actually only imitate what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
BBC Director General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public information.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and order new works, I also really think it's important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports, had to put the commercial rivals on the feet.
Tory Deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on a special BBC way".
He added that he wished the company "to find a hit from our own stable" when it started a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee paying for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased the slowest in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there has been the lowest result since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday braked the spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the main shopping streets in the UK have transformed into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth rate since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five per cent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go down until 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, the IMRG sales index publisher to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to buy their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the couch.
But now it's coming up, and we'll probably see that growth is slowing down.
The Black-Friday phenomena imported from America is quoted as a reason for the declining transactions.
Experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event, which will take place on the last Friday of November each.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers fell around their computers to make their buds, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for snakes, could prevent buyers from buying.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that about £5 was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is punished
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts part of the collapse of the huge Saudi bin store group to bear
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed in Mecca's mosque.
Sad ones, largely dressed in white, filled the route to make their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning procession moved over at the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell upon the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi King imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beetles that were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried by the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Haddsh will continue to Mecca with thousands of people who will continue to come to town.
Today King Salman said that the bin store group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin store group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane, which fell into a courtyard of the large mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsh, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of de Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for non-current security measures and because it had not cooperated with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca's big mosque as part of the massive construction project, led by the bin store group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an abyss son who was defiled by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain, just a few days before millions arrived in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered 1 million Rial (£ 174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured persons.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales locations across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British are deposing their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you are sent to handle a hammer or brush to stretch walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Because British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform homeworker jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a significant increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest prices has now been outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q sales sites.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment the men are overweight with the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that had more female single households that were doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this towards a more balanced situation.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of women's decisions to buy articles.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-year profits and sales after the group increased the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Aich/Dob officials for infidelity in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vicemaster Aich/Dob had to be responsible for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants didn't confess guilty.
One of them had also been accused of abuse.
He was legally released from this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the pre-investigation, it had emerged that between 2006 and 2011, the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officers are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was distinguished by the President of the Opening Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defence argued that the association had no asset disadvantage at any time.
The athletes would only have paid compensation and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, had been released from debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 Schilling in 2001 (about 44,000 euros).
"We were facing the situation at that time: will we continue to run the club or will we lock it down?", said one of the accused, in the bread industry, major auditor of the financial office.
With his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to assume this task.
With all the risks.
"We went ahead of money, we put our life insurances to the bank as security," he said when he agreed.
The association was agreed: you can manage the money freely, it must not be made any debt.
Moreover, in the event of financial success, the reimbursement of compensations had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the compensation was paid only years later, namely from the year 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, package and not detailed depreciations appeared, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two accused together, said the second accused.
Why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association had not been interested in detail in the financial disclosure, only the freedom of debt had been important, so the answer.
In 2011, when an official began investigations on abuse of office, a sum of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
That had been reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account was on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put it in space.
The co-accused had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "compensation for damages".
Why compensation?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what do I do if the lawyer says, "With this you're all out of the tailor"?
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never earned a cent of salary, he had only calculated kilometre money and diets.
At diets he had charged the club 1,000 euros a month, but the actual burden had been much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to present accurate documents for the early years.
They explained that they had no longer been retained after an operating audit in which everything had been assessed as correct.
The second defendant had also paid kilometre money.
All corrections had been made in cash, he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he stated in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard removes more 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been taking place for three years, the computer giant will deplete further jobs when splitting up the company.
The shifts at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer.
This is intended to save costs of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company informed on Tuesday.
This step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will occur from the fourth quarter.
The decreasing of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP still employed approximately 302,000 employees.
The Hewlett-Packard share returned 2.3 percent after the stock.
The group from the California Palo Alto, which has grown up with printers, is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business is to be grouped in a new society for a long time - apart from the more future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from business customers for its services have last been used to the second largest PC manufacturer worldwide for Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5%.
Turnover fell by 8 percent to just $25.4 billion.
This led to a decline in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to changes in the industry with a fragmentation and massive shifts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, was only late responding to the fact that customers were strengthening to buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and to do more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide a total of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected: 54 per cent voted against, 35 per cent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 per cent of respondents, 20 per cent of respondents.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
The centre of the trade fair is networked, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days of press, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility".
The general audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors as two years ago.
Roszke: the outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
On the Serbian border, the Hungarian police have deployed trawling gas and water throwers against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind it, a police line had been formed and behind the police there was a water thrower ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials first used uninterrupted pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was tested towards the refugees.
The group was thus dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas cried.
Other refugees sucked together and suffered breathing distress.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Noting Bank
The world watches when the US Notenbank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not.
A survey among 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which still felt last week that the Fed would do this, now think that the Fed will hold a little longer and the interest rates will be at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good level of performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink view of global circumstances.
It has warned the markets to stand up for an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20.00 MEZ on Thursday
Death protectors at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before later in the day he shot and killed his colleague - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it "does him sorry" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unfolded," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer of Geography and Social Science at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency station staff that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife yesterday night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb didn't explain his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, 19, and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb moved his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In spring 2015, Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University, as his lifelau indicates on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky bearer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also supposed to be fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
The Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the group.
Half a billion euros a year is trying to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's around 1,000 leaders will cost the company's work.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
The Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and values the Eurowings.
The aim of the redirection is to achieve a result of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline informed on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business in the future.
The Eurowings cheap airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the executive team of Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the re-establishment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organisation of the 120,000 employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC) the negotiations will be resumed on Thursday after the judicially stopped strike.
This was announced by the trade union.
The subject of the discussions should be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wanted "in one year with a predicted record result" to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
The background is the "Wings" savings concept in addition to the pilot's transition supply.
It provides that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, will deploy routes to the Eurowings Group's own cheap line.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the South" paintings by Leena Krüger are seen in the artist's house.
For the White Hall of the House, Finns, who have been in Göttingen for a long time, have prepared a selection of titleless works that encourage their viewers to travel on a journey.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left foreign defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give the hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The wound was caused by an unprecedented attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very difficult and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
In the dressing cabin, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red map and the imposition of an eleven meters.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11-meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I come back stronger."
Concerning this: Manchester United suffers Luke Shaw's loss in defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the defender of England has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in another direction, so it looked like he had touched him [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a film game by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you almost know it outside.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When a childcare system provider asked him to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax chose the environmental fable published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Lucky, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far."
All right, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead reproduces the content of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is destroyed by the money-giving, thneeding once-beams despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a sneaky, sneaky being, "speaking in the name of the trees", "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a child.
A downing street speaker said that the text was probably from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still difficult
Attacking Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the frame that England chose for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series loss is not on my card.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth quits the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyze for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
During his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best selectors.
Long ago, Lyth's course would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hopefully strikes out further runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not deliver such good achievements, and I am not surprised; he is especially a team man.
The question of how much time a test fighter gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I highly appreciate.
He is a X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as before him, but this depends, of course, on the team's performance in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat next to Cook, which would provide an extra-spin bowler and receive four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hit man can't beat there, and that left hand has already shown that he's a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealing with him he impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the beater and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there is no large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a few wise supplements to the trainer's staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a championship.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a lot of experiences because he has played against all attacks under all conditions.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing cabin, even if the news is in line with the previous.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team designers do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken by easy heart.
The Brexit Storage (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could grow if the economy gets into a flush by 2017
David Cameron's unfinished re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to get deeper in trouble every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is violently controversial about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, so deeply confused in different crises as the EU is now and are not always tired of the UK's own agenda, with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they do not usually want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if it jeopardized social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes an exterior UK inside the EU tent - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin, and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's careful Chancellor Angela Merkel is an alliesman, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggerated long endurers such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his reelection or replacement in 2017.
He is also a blazing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will break out a leg to help the selfies whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want because most of them have similar separatistic trends.
Therefore, some of these ministers may even intentionally plan not helpful comments, quite in the SNP style, while UK referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The re-negotiation was a plethora" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the re-negotiation."
The Europeans know how rude the Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarch of the press baron, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can be weak in remembering Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro-Opportunist, who made a name as a "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-frightening shrinks, telephone-hackling foreigners and the pseudo-non-invaded people who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming at lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum vertebra, because Blair had put the principle of the EU Constitution not adopted, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened him a back door.
The press never left him with this.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knock on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need time to waste for me - seems at risk of repeating Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake at the time and today.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I would like to express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue-colour trend and the wilderness of Tory's small-englandism can probably say yes.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" said to Benn on the radio and on the television this week when the path founder fought in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried to be ill-loyal to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his controversials and MEPs after all reports at their Monday evening session.
Whatever the rocky bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the TV age around the clock and above all in the strudel of social media, a bridegroom of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to consider Labour's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite settlement economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not start a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start of Monday of something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and describes it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the loadability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "built on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were invited to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) in order to synthesize their views on the damages of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO should have previously received British American Tobacco Mittel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette campaigns, some of which also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The research of the group "reasonably" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage to most products in most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's assertions that "there has been no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way of smoking for children or non-smoking" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded before.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Each second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to that, but that we continue to have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year of a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not safe, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Chief of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hardly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will commission or send programs that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson said to the Oberhaus Communication Committee in his study of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least have its production on programs that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program could be financed even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC's fault of hunting for reviews was "because of the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-legal niche programs should go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion radio fees, "Now, of course, we have created all these obsolete programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee Johnson said to the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a great value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Head of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also pronounced before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission, "to inform, form and maintain".
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example to the public television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this to "inform, clarify and maintain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the proms, where he said that only one handful will be shown on TV, and with the commercial broadcasters to enter alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses which have high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gave electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fade worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then enter the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their moton euron TRP-4 ion channels wear.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms where they switch on the modified moton eurons.
The process has some similarities with Optogenetics, a breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and eliminate neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves of tissue can pass freely and can be sent to the brain from above onto the skull.
"We believe that with genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the target human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your door!
The advertisements disgrace British arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffs Watch Messen video.
Awful murderer drones!
Footers crushing legs!
Streubbombs!
And electric shock bars that cause pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images make no doubt that this announcement for the world's largest arms fair is a fighting parodie produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's readiness to shrink arms to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
Related: DSEI Arms Fair: Authorized regimes flow to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"A key announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the brands of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September a swing of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum for Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbus keys, of which is claimed that "access to about a third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet."
Transport for London finds this poster "Vandalism" not funny.
One of the parodie advertisements produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and note that they have to go outside to the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works with the graphics and voiceover artists, who also works free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade fair - through an empty place of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "We give them the campaign that try to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic ambiguous company advertising, but "by blossoming with bright colors and animation it remains more responsible."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not being handed out illegally in front of our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors fabulously conceal euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab unveiled an order from the U.S. army about "the AT4CS RS shot off by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely formed head of battle that delivers outstanding after-effect effects within the target."
Whatever that does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Elf years ago, as a 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I have angry - and the numerous long-awaited complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student homes ranges from slightly nervous-free to absolutely terrifying.
It's enchanting to whisper: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took the sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why "honestly said Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your wrinkles were fired and those fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues and communal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress up and back up their underwear.
Reflecting from this: Don't think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverted people receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugee, but many student homes form a space-to-space boom culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I've consumed for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a communion is exhausted of company - and send him a SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the peak of the back-many, knocking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome in the neighborhood, I have baked something to you. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to close friendships.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed clums made of flour, sugar and fat lead people to stand asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clawing of chickens is a thief, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balanced than my roommate who added a dish to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that prevents people from sleeping or working.
It is not only about being a decent person, but about being one of the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the proverb.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it would be okay for them to make Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They reacted with even more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly left her neighbors to sleep two hours before she had her own music plastered, closed her door and went to her three-hour trial.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same student home?
On the other hand, it wouldn't be absolutely embarrassing if you were holding a roommate for your future mate, touching on her, separating her again and then seeing them every day and perhaps seeing how she moves all the common friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk a little sense to your abdomen.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between a Ulk and mobbing is more fine than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a bummer.
Give by hiding a valuable and fun lesson about security - but never ruin anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer - but do not fix their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate operator Markus Gildner builds row houses for people who don't have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need shelter, but also the single parent and the low earner."
"I'm showing how to build well and cheaply today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will press on the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheap housing can be created: he builds a series of refugee houses in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will press on the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people remain here for a large part.
In view of the flow of refugees, we also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A rowhouse needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses currently built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their respective needs.
How much are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's overwhelming.
It took six months to build.
That is appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: By way of building law, I have correctly completed my project.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles heavy special construction and the parking regulation.
That's awful.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities lacks room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their rowhouse project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you tightening up the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True, we have had a building tree in Germany over the past five years, but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent or the low earner.
I will show you how to build well and cheaply today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that tells us that the "software update" has failed.
To avoid the problem, users are recommended either to wait until the storm returns or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it unlikely by sliming the update. It will also be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or close to a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to be continued, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to an interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one currency in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Volle Attacke".
The World Cup second emphasised before the start in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore".
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The UK has already won seven of the previous 12 seasonal races and also takes the Flott-Grand Prize in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British was able to win the race.
Whether the current Smog in the City State will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Chachfriends Bad Kissingen" founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks, so the membership number increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen to cure.
Gauselmann is the supporter of the First Class and Honorary Citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation, which received the president Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the member's contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" be seen as an expression of his relationship with the Kurstadt.
Quartier office searches for direct contact
Saludis and the old center Antonistift have gathered together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to discussions, you can also take part in courses.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically, to the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and counsellors will immediately receive information on issues such as health insurance or health insurance services.
For years, we have found with our ambulance care service that often caregivers are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"As well as not rarely many cash benefits are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new housemaster Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civil Hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the discussions, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken to the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the senior centre and the Saludis are complemented in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described "The Senior Care and Care Centre".
The reason for opening the new quarter office in the city centre both executives see particularly demographic change.
This will make a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration celebrations, the quarter office also devoted itself to the convening at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular joint meeting."
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Intracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the date for FC Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers was not yet set for renovation at the Fuchs Park Stadium, October 6 was set as a date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the Eighth Final of the Bavarian Football Topocal against the third-list FC Würzburger Kickers was terminated.
Played on Tuesday 6 October at 7 p.m. in the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are glad that we know now when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the start-up card pre-sale.
It's special for our team to play against a third-list.
We therefore hope for many viewers, and this is not without reason, because flood games have a special attraction.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by victory at District Litigator 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against Regional Litigator 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition gets 5000 euros and qualifys for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Vereinspokal.

Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Dean's of Vienna Architecture, is dead.
He died already on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses a member of honor and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was mentioned in the exhibition.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture during and after World War II at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasure Chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and to rebuild the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws a police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been badly noticed in Bremen.
Soccer was once, now Tim Wiese, former national gatekeeper in Germany and engaged in Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
He wants to have spent 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years, according to his own statement.
He has not been intellectually involved.
In the city centre of Bremen, Wiese was cut just when he saw a car park guard presenting a penal ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Grass then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw her the due fine before her feet, as the "image" letter reports.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will be decided whether or not weed is displayed.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the cultivation of marijuana plants.
For three days the Panaman authorities have cut out the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men Fight 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses search the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, according to the police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft bank.
There were also three persons on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now shouted at the young and struck him with the fist in his face.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and bled from the nose.
When his two friends arrived and appealed to the fighter, he first abandoned his sacrifice.
By his friends the injured young man was now brought home.
The offender followed the group with a car up to their apartment and passed there demonstrationally several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the beater and another male.
With the help of a stroke, the victim's face and thigh were beaten.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far there is only a vague description of the offender.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second striker was about 1,65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and informants to sign up under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
It is also a pleasure for the community mayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and asendorf mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country doctors are missing - Asendorf has luck: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich still stands with half a position to his successor in the coming months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12th, until then, he invests EUR 310000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, years ago, who is currently attending their medical training at the Verdener Hospital and also intends to enter into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple Müller enjoyed the idea of operating his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the double family father Frank Müller grew up, followed his medical study in Hanover in several doctoral practice stations as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and is volunteering in the DRK's preparedness for Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
As of 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a doctor, his wife Ursel (Internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to settle as house doctors.
"The endoscopy comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and loading ECGs and need a speaker room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of EUR 50000 under a support programme from the county (EUR 25000) as well as from the community (EUR 12500) and the municipality (12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," stresses Samtburger Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients enter the practice of Felstehausen each quarter, with the average practice in northern Germany being about 500.
There is another practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found herself, she would have gone.
By the way, whoever visits Müller's speech hour continues to look especially in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell ends an era in Asendorf, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Rockstehausen remembers shyly.
She feels a little wrath after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients," says the internist.
Your husband adds laughing, "We have a 6000 square meters base."
"Bisher, I've always pushed myself for gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border checks are also being carried up at our southern border," said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
Controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do so "safely".
The provision and security of people is the main issue.
But it is also clear, "that it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even not across the Austrian-Slovene border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considered "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arrival refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and possibly also to establish corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with the Minister of Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will rather intensify border monitoring - especially with Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to unlock its limits for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his or her obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees would have tried to pass to East Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in order to avoid registration at night hours to Tuesday.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby corn fields.
According to the local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly entering Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It is mainly concerned with Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days his country counts with around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, reported consistently on Wednesday Croatian and Serbian media.
However, the government in Belgrade disputed that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We can not, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and further buses would be expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had traveled through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police have told us that we should drive here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
In fact, the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Mazedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers, could come to a slightly wester distance.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Minister for the Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "completing possibilities for border control".
Strength checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, and since then the EU partners have consistently issued a good witness to the country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees continue to be detained behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they would have spent the last night at Horgo's border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two Horgos and Backi Breg border crossings remain completely blocked.
It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border.
Nebojsa Stefanovic, the Serbian Minister of the Interior, tried to calm down on Wednesday early in a local eye card in Horgos: he thought the debates on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border has been closed, were premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in some parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war mine fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners was sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hackers: Ukrainer pays 30 million dollars
Supranonok is supposed to have belonged to a ring of cyber criminals, who has been accused of having ever again given insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information used is intended to have insider business in the financial markets.
According to the investigators, the total amount was over $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case lasted.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The offenders are supposed to have acted both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecomenical Hospice Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz, there is a reign of operation.
People do their concerns, partly quick steps, partly cozy buzzing.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autossalon at Paradeplatz.
Hold city tracks.
Pulsing, splendourful life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I die."...
The Ecomenical Hospice Help with this action drew attention to its 20-year existence and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so with the action we went into the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecomenical Hospice Help is also available to the Passenger for questions and conversations as well as to the volunteers.
While some people spontaneously grab the crane and read the sentence of "yes my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "not long suffering", others stay short, read, say phrases like "as far as I am not yet" and then go on.
There are always small discussions on the action itself, on life, the handling of dying.
Peter Hübinger is also right on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will eventually come to me, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconian work Mannheim, who together with the Caritas Association is the supporter of the Ecomenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone on the boards wants to share publicly, but that it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death was still involved with Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience confronted with the theme, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to participate in the death relief.
When the ecumenical Hospice was looking for honorary officers, she immediately logged in and was involved in the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honoraries - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can well deal with her task and the experiences and experiences that have been made.
"I see life from another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecomenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of the sickness banks and donations of families and associations enables training and training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There too, other personal wishes can be listed on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit prospects to a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a FactSet survey, $10.84.
The lower outlook comes in spite of the price increases, which are on average 0.9 per cent and will become effective on 4 January, and in spite of higher increases for land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November.
The company said that it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "sustained revenues when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, predicted by twelve analysts interviewed by Zack Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12,3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping, which has led to the stagnation of sales in its unit Express shipping.
But the boom in the online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record record on June 11.
At its most expected meeting this year, Federal Reserve Strategen spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the Leitzins for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatening over them at an end of the decorated two-storey meeting hall, there is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual order from the Congress: keeping the US employment maximizing and prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. On Thursday it will be announced whether the US economy is ready to start getting rid of the unprecedented incentive by the short-term rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that they are growing firmly, recent turbulences on global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed representatives to strengthen this volatility by increasing the interest rate on federal bonds - and it is only a quarter percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself uncertains the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the Strategen lightens the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "they should go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Another month ago, the Fed seemed to be in good ways to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints made by liberals, that more economic progress would be necessary, she expects an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed sees as full employment.
Salary increases have shown signs of recovery.
And even though inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil travel.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would dive global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the racks at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US Not Bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data that describes the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "restrict" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to basic economic data."
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is in favour of an increase in interest rates, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its leitzins by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "with a very limited impact on growth in the US", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives revoked these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's Board of Interests.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to get into the situation in which it is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are exciting," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/the warehouse is a central contact point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewellery and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to drag through the corridors.
If the entire shopping make you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage (good and affordable) in this shop is located close to the case and has various take-off options.
What's here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat table is extensive, as is the fish table - the staff behind the table will clean and file the fish and even bake for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgant, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and gall, pig natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for shopping cars and forks.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support indiscriminate asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum applicant home on the Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German.
Of course, this is quite different from at a proper school.
Brazil’s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women about how important good diet is during breastfeeding. This is done with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie supply by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The municipality council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flater for solar equipment.
The planning of the long-awaited gym building at the Bernrieder Sports Site is step by step: at the recent municipal council meeting, the drafted construction proposal was blessed unanimously without major discussions.
Previously, the panel had, among other things, decided on an application for a "restriction" or "restriction" from the valid construction plan.
The "exempt" was the permit for a special form relating to the roof construction.
Thus, a "satteldach with non-medium first and roof overstand" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants: "This will bring us a wonderfully large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roof inclination which should be below ten degrees for energy reasons, unlike in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was necessary because the construction plan does not allow "excerpts" in terms of the roof inclination, with the Bernrieder Municipal Council generally being more restrictive in the case of exemption applications.
However, Turnhallenbau is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," said Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are calculated on costs.
Grants are expected from the promotion of school and broad sports.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters hall is now submitted for examination to the Land Council Office.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned, namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg with Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county, the Landrätin Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board and will be held on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The majority should move with fishermen and the still existing internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
Workers who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The staff are informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should join the successor, Jochner-White said that the name "Fischer" came into the game, who declared himself willing to take the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case means a "revaluation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
Transitional arrangements for the next two years with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses until next year, the former hospital of the Incapacity, which still has 35 beds, will be definitively closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing rehabilitation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumours that the house in possession of the federal shortage should be used as a shelter for asylum webers in the future.
"I exclude that." As the property goes on, Jochner-Weiß could not say, there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," said Fischer over the quasi move to the leak, which had been "positive and very comprehensible" of the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house in which fishermen worked as a chief doctor for over 30 years.
He was asked by Mr Schongauer's colleagues to take over the position of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (only 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar lions are required this evening (20.15 a.m.) at Bergische HC.
While the table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is no reason for arrogance.
In the last season, the bathers made a painful defeat at BHC and have something to make up for.

Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of violent crimes
A suspect led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing young people and throwing their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a crime of violence.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as the prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, was considered a suspect who confessed the act and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the night before after a visit to a autumn party in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspect was found against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the detainee admitted in the police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-olds and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the detainee on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
Further investigations are to be carried out on the nearest circumstances of the act.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gaps
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have begun for a long time.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet demand for affordable dwellings, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's what's missing 140,000 apartments.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial shelter.
Many then enter the housing market and enter into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not just due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also constitutes significant shortcomings in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany creates a housing deficit that grows from year to year.
At present, some 770,000 residential units were missing in the urban areas,” says Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in major cities in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed in the "Hotel Mama" for a long time because of the flush in the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined again for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance of Social Housing proposes a new start.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing.
Thus, the basic labour tax could be waived and the basic tax on subsidised dwellings could be suspended on a temporary basis.
Furthermore, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The State Bank KfW's support programme for refugee accommodation is already well suited to cities and communities.
A good week after the start on Monday evening, with 184 million euros, more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had already been collected.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
In Hungary, there is virtually no way through, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant transit via Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
But the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Ministry of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been left to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had sealed its refugee border on the previous day.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, it are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police took the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
Most media reports reported that they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by tax to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbia border, the refugees do not encounter border areas.
To this end, the border line poses other risks: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine landfillers are now to quickly create a safe passage.
However, few more refugees are coming to Hungary after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws imply the overcoming and damage to the border area as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The convicted threatens imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the "Transitzons" newly established at the border on Tuesday, of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition from Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees would have stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be expelled there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to clean it up.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Lockers were degraded and one of the reception camps at the border location was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this change.
Austria still reaches few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, some 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to government instructions.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on instructions from the German authorities in the morning.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing with suitcases at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was at Wernstein's end," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars over the border to near Passau.
Previously, we first tasted the unexpected guests with jams and drinks.
We just said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"This was for us of course," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man couldn't take a generous donation - 100 euros for the firefighter.
"We were very pleased," said Stadler.
On Sunday evening, the beached train passengers had moved from a ICE to a regional train towards Passau, in Wels, to try to stop rail transport to Germany over the border after the short-term announcement.
However, the regional train was left before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge party was linked to the Bavarian neighbours on Sundays with a cosy, day before a two-brochure sporty run - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from New Churches.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us another thousand Zigs is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our federal Chancellor has reverted the position of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of national socialism in a highly official and public way.
These policies are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "promised country", which they invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
There will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing flows of refugees and the coming winter, to create decent conditions for protection seekers with us.
And it will be even greater - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad searching for 35,000 winter holiday quarters
Konrad has full hands with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception centre of Traiskirchen has already taken control of Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday had been done without a big webel, Konrad said and praised the organisational "Master Performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in the daytime.
In order to meet the number, there are still 35,000 accommodations to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 of the union.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already held discussions with the heads of the country.
They would have assured him that he would also be able to create quarters for the future refugees.
"In Oberösterreich, things go well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer accommodation easily.
In addition, hotels are hoped to be empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it cannot be that the quartermaker must keep a certain height of the towel holders or size of the upper lights.
"Not standards" should be applied for a limited period of time.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, that he was more successful in accommodation, Konrad founded with his experience.
I am an older gentleman, whom you can't tell in the face the intrusion.
Convincing power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Your own quarter search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But apparently there are problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better distribution
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for refugee accommodation is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, since the parties concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further sites are to be examined for the emergency.
The city leader is criticizing the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Greens are not locked off"
In a longer telephone address with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed.
The transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not exist before.
However, the applicants would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU Member States.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of German action.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the stock exchanged IT group S&T has been moved in and the remainder (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young innovative technology companies.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later acquiring those.
From the beginning S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Oberösterreich and the Federal Federation (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters left area in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second business in the Arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to put himself on a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade in a short time: she has now gained growth in the form of another business venue.
In the Furla shop in front of the shop, in which they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and garments from different manufacturers, everything is now turning around women's handbags of the Furla brand, exchanges must have from 75 euro.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
Previously several weeks have been rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time if I should open another store," says Breit.
The decision was crucial, among other things, that the Furla producers who are home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large area of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves.
Her fashion interest has been put wide from her mother in the weighing.
I'm most dying if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women look like a beautiful handbag in enchantment, the professional woman can't answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag values every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kalllstadt
The ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the landlords.
This property also connects some with the billionaire that wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for thrills.
Whether he speaks foreign-fiently, beats journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US President's Office strongly revives the election campaign.
And cut well with it.
This is also recorded in the local cold town, where the grandparents of the property millionaire are born.
The New Yorker with the hairfrisur is a term for many in the winery village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is related to him more than -20 corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the palace: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstädter Simone Wendel filmed Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it somehow exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their cold-town kind," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädter has filmed a fun documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, including the ketchup family Heinz, in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also speaking in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth", says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname, which has the call town in the circle, "The Brulljesmachers" - too high-German: the creators, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the owners.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold graves in the United States.
The real estate group was the first to purchase land in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: your desire to return to the home forever failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz belonged then.
He did not record Trump because he once left without permission, the director of the Institute of History and People's Sciences, Roland Paul, had declared the film start.
Trump is the grandchild of a "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly reluctantly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to discourage illegal immigrants.
"As the polter, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trumps ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born of Heinz").
The retired winer sees the American rather remotely, "he's always so overwhelming."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of cold town."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family gave something for the church angels on a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She would feel better if he didn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had the commandment at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My president isn't," she says.
And: "The grapes will be matured without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, also in the United States.
The municipality of Ramsau in Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteigerdörfer".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are running to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major shifts in the reviews for Today.
The Nine breakfast show was broadcast by the Federal Capital when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's fall.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Army Days, was a part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the distance ranged from 40,000 to 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 with Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for the check!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently announced father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Criticists had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17.30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623.000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour sat 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will vote nine confidently that Hot Seat will finally continue at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn't make it possible to overfly McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unaware who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, where Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor, was kept secretly.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not tell if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons streams the day before three of them become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have left out in a lyric way why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers to the game destroyer could become who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavez-Fellows and Markoski called both Mackay as the best partner for wood quickly, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment when I went to the house and (Sara's) and Sam's energies noticed, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought it throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it is so fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the One".
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreserved about him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not, she was ridiculous.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I also love the remaining girls - it's an indiscriminate difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast to Ten on Wednesday, 19:30.
Originally published as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banned Hayne on the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a ring as the Aussie-Rugby League converter did at his first score return on Tuesday on 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punch-return and also to the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his smokes through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49's sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who told him to forget his hidden catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble fluently and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the slicer with his origin debut in 2007, when a passport in his own in-Goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested in a Siberian roller field with weapons.
After he had openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, seized his oil company Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Clause in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bavarian schools if there were no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we'll get misconduct in the Bavarian education system."
The Free Election Group meets in the sub-French municipality until Friday.
In fact, there were quite other main issues.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voter meetings.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the clausure," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it existed during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also asked for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need federally uniform standards."
"Bayers move away, others not."
"We have to become more capable of doing that."
However, national policy in Great Wall City should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started at 47 gymnasias the pilot experiment "mid-stage plus" in which an extension of the middle-stage from three to four years is tested - as a result, it will last again nine years until graduation.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The G9 theme needs to be accelerated," said the FW head.
We call for freedom of choice for all those who want to.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

Infineon shares increased by another 3.22% at the Dax tip.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" followed the weekend.

4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shots into a crowd of people protesting against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in the district of Rupandehi on Tuesday night, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before using rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, known to be able to kill but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last week of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who wanted their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent conflicts since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial subject in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for marketing the 4000 square meters surfaces.
Planned is a mixture of trade, business and housing - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the old post youth centre.
The preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it is said by the city.
Which investor is eligible is not yet clear.
As a result, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already purchased part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße, a few months ago and let the building on it break.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for holiday homes at the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Several residents are further concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
For months, bargained, grabbed, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday house near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans for the first time publicly at the Emder Council's City Development Committee on Monday evening.
Initially, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, who blamed the investor and the administration for mystery, Ralf Behrends went from the System Building Management to the offensive: "We have not answered all the questions yet," he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The EUR 10 to 12 million expensive project has been discussed for months.
Strong reactions among seabud owners who had come to the meeting highlighted the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Seabudsman and member of the Board of Directors of the Pro Hieve, complains: "This is going to be a giant hull that overshoots all the other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that the planned size of the facility would increase considerably: "There all bus loads must come so that it can be expected," says Schulz.
However, what happens exactly on the very hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Twenty-year-olds at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted to be young with his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian raised twins yesterday.
Twinbirths are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and had been in 1967 in Frankfurt, says the zoo.
The sex of the newly born Gorilla twins is not yet firm, since Mother Dian has kept them close to the body so far.
First, the "image" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical spine storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example, in the middle of the Cape Town Islands and the Little Antilles, has a 60% potential to form a tropical spine in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign that is intended to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrolled the European nations because they are fleeing out of war-breaked and poor countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when making the donation call known on his blog.
Instead of getting a manager to make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"One of our trips included many dark railway and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations are made available to four non-profit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/fugeerelief are doubled to 11 million dollars.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which was destroyed by the war.

For slightly overweight diabetes, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for patients with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It's still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a key article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to eat food.
Over the years, adipositas operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been shown to be effective, but most studies have been performed in people who are ill-fat with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight relative to size, is considered to be normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered fatty.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital have used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of adipositas cirurgia - stomach bypass and gastric hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately equal to 29.
Among those who undergone surgery, the diabetes disease was completely resolved at 36% and at 28%.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved by only one percent and in part by just about two percent.
In addition, the results in the blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the "surgical" group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c reflecting blood sugar over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at approximately 8 per cent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Chirurgie group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had rather a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show the survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there was about 29 percent less likely to die in obesity patients who were subjected to adipositas surgery over 15 years - compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any advantage for survival in the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was calming for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies firmly to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays In Hunsback
It is a topic that is currently becoming more important in the Belletistry: a young woman, unpopular and inextricable at school, after years meets the scourge of her youth, and he fell in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "We are not really like this" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the history of love, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker reader, because he plays in boring and surrounding localities.
The main professional author grew up in boring and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the cessation of violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which devotes itself to ethical studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed in the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that while the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development can be created, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to consider how the killing in their countries will be reduced.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11th, and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand desinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed strong alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the revenues from hand disinfectants for children under the age of 12 reported by toxic control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children come to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them go to emergency," Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children drink disinfectants deliberately, while some do it to impress their friends or for a try of courage with social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people allegedly mix disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberries, grapes and orange fragrances that are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectants contain alcohol somewhere between 45 and 95 percent.
In particular, few syringes can cause alcohol poisoning, especially in small children.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the toxic emergency centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas, broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't leave any whiskey around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in the reach of children, and if children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four injections from the fragrance hand desinfectant to strawberry at school, was brought to an emergency.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the threshold that is considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lalled her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain tragedy, since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit his head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand desinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health authorities employees suspect that the product contained methanol, a fatal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom", reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand desinfectants and expelled her from her room.
The police considered the ruined plan as a "sweep" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
An 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in the event of an accident on the crossroads between North Ring and On Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads towards the industrial area and noticed too late that two previous vehicles had stopped on the crossroads.
Afterwards, he jumped his truck into the back of an Audi and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fiesta standing ahead.
The accidentally involved vehicles caused damage of around 10,000 euros, the police report.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be dragged away.
S rumour kitchens: No disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths plays the discourse of disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but he will turn this again.
Hearts will fight SFA for accusation of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious in January-Neuve obligations that could destroy the unity of the frame
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's eleven meters in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talks about disharmonic
There are rumours about disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, which was rejected spontaneously by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates were not under increased control because they were preparing for confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle field player and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what she's interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old company games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen was followed, which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that exactly - but we have to go on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
It's so important to stand together now.
Warburton cautious during January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which pointed out that he did some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious when signing new entrances and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox framework.
The ex-chief of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
Players coming in summer have this season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with retreat notice
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, indicated that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expired.
The 29-year-old has plagued himself with a ugly ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson Comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later revoked - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he said, and insists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid tynecastle
The irreparable hibee was corrected after he admitted to singing a song with stubborn texts about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the storm said and added, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will bring the boys back on track," said Donnelly.
McInnes glad to win against Hamilton "unhappily".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them a five-point advance before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's eleven meters in the first half of the time.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in pokal games or ligas that have not even won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it increases in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May to July, while the number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of the UK of 5.5%, as shown by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now being 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said, "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It was almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunken disturbed the run
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray were the officials able to keep the disruptors in custody.
A breathing alcohol test was performed with a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2,15 promille and first remained in custody.
Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in the event of a late legal intervention, I will see a man being brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary if Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and since more applications are available than places, a macaber lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionally.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship with phoneates and a two-and-a-half-hour visit over the months.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that she could have "been able to formulate it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the publicity of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of Podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all details here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this point of view, I'll see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police hunting persuades to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang up the police was unfit when he was in the swamping water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "softly persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house peace break in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water- and said, "I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "a good policeman negotiated".
"Some people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master's football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the tombs to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy out and threatened to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He focused on the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a racing day treatment, the last strawhalm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt cup sample at Lidaris, which he can't explain.
He had stopped 18 months because of the spying accusations and didn't want it to "show like too high-hung grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised heads, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don't do this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out its stable.
"At eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a cheater.
If that is the case, they should certainly grab their noses because they failed in trying to grab me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should that bring me to the opinion that it will be personal?
Has the RVL acted cowardly and perhaps makes people outside coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say will let them think about it now.
But I came to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exercise pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the trainer has built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could " throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeatable master Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule "laughterly" after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly put sludge on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was so on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on the race day. An investigation of this issue was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver's escape
The police arrested a man in the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was shipped with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police in Shepparton stood.
He is expected to be charged with driver escape and neglected assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He's in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy defeats rivals for claims to fight rings
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of tackling his players as "agenda setting" by two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed Storm players to "ring fight" with his team during the high Storm victory at the Qualifying Final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly concealed comment on the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's thanksgiving and said that they were only focusing on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team agrees to him confidently because it meant that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team.
"This is coming up again and again - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson was talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or technology all year round, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has brought us the trend change.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. Therefore, he is probably not used to losing, so it was a little shock for him.
It's funny, as this is always happening at this time of the year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "thinking football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a shithead.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build greater confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the schedules.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in one phase.
The Storm team has been free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the prefinal next Saturday evening at AAMI Park. Ticket sale starts next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit by drug bank
A man who may have a lifetime penalty for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and attacked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his fellow accused in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible lifetime penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that it could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to obtain his release.
"After reading the oath statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he issues his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and holds an exit lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident at A5 at Karlsruhe: Driver's house breaks apart
In the event of an accident involving three trucks on highway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had been braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and in vain tried to move to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the person responsible for the accident was completely broken apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122.000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to attract paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, logged in to an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "related" web searches, which used terms for searching for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "failed to be a police officer to scare them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a addiction that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to frighten paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to attract her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment to have taken inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the requirements on 25 January this year and not to have appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual criminals, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted a deposit in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Lockers depart from small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austria border.
Many lockers left people more at smaller border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, a spokesman of the Federal Police said.
Through the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been arrested in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and barrels.
They are received and forwarded to registration by federal police.
At the Munich Central Station, according to Federal Police information, a significant increase in the number of refugees arrived in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
At 8:00 a.m. alone, about 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austria border, on Tuesday, 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" expects exit in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across West Europe, warm sea air flows into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) told Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the trigger of the tropic storm "Henry", which in recent days had been drawn from the Bermuda islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and storms are expected especially in bathing.
According to DWD, even until Thursday early in the Black Forest, on the Schwäbischen Alb and in the Bodenseekreis, there are bows of 60 to 90 hours.
Thus, on Friday the sun can be seen again longer.
The mass does it: every two years the carmakers at the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015 there is particularly movement in the compact cars, which currently sell themselves very well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly demanding: Around 28.1 percent of the new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone, according to Autofahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented in particular this year.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to ensure that the volume model also sells well, the new astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel expects an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1,4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the lifts offer additional diesel and petrol engines ranging from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only available as five doors at first.
The second variant will follow the combi in the spring, which is already available on the IAA.
And what is going to happen to new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane to race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five door in a conventional and stressed sporty GT version.
He is traded at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan Deployer wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its swinged lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeter (Nm) according to manufacturer data.
The Baleno in Europe is launched in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but roundly renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën deployer put mainly hand on the front: Here the cooler grill has been redrawn and the modified headlamps are equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI join the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are human indecent
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex-custodian of the Tegel Court of Justice, who had been housed in a small cell for months.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are located in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the people concerned can even hope for money if they were locked in the close rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel Judicial Execution Centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of ground floor; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man who, according to his lawyer's information, is now on his own foot had been moved into a larger cell.
His civil liability complaint for the invaluable conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges lifted the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and returned to the case for re-examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of the compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, for the period in question only a few days of detention were relevant for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, "a discouragement of the legal protection of the personality would be feared".
The Court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only granted compensation to a prisoner in April because he was nakedly trapped in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet is also unworthy.
In addition, on Wednesday, Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then applicant had been living in a cell similar to that in the case of Karlsruher between 15 and 21 hours a day over three months.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore constantly included 23 hours, the aggression is increasing, even to battles is supposed to have already occurred due to the tension.
According to the Judicial Press Centre, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied because of younger age shortages and 19 are expected to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry of Interior forecasts, and, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it."
What happens to Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, dwellings are used annually between 350,000 (as estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (as estimated by the Pestel Institute) for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as has been built (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rented properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social apartments per year are excluded from the rental price commitment, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million euros to a billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing should be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a support amounting to 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 per cent of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration Researcher Dietrich Thranhardt.
In Germany, according to Thranhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on employment for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was earlier a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence obligation, which limited asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, a majority of the view has been expressed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster, even due to the lack of skilled staff.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
To date, there is no sufficient range of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Thranhardt, the royal road to labour integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few escaped parents are giving their children into the kitas, estimated at ten to 15 percent: "For the unrooted parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
To convince the family of the advantages of Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
If the need for educators increased significantly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for teaching in welcome classes.
They are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no Federal State prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception was so far Berlin, but internal senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Voluntary refugees could facilitate access to higher education.
For refugees with a residence permit or tribute will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act when they start studying.
The latter in principle do not receive a baffe, as they do not fall within the circle of the baffe rightful persons.
So far, patient refugees have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög, and as of January 1, 2016, this span is reduced to 15 months.
This funding gap also needs to be closed, but Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Students' Work demands.
Students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successively grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing State-Church law to a new State-Religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that carries professional attention to the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and give it some control.
This includes the willingness to take action against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the President of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to live here, in Germany," he said in the Bayrian radio.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more a subject of society as a whole than today.
This will also have to change the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, for a few decades a anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants' organisations and the interests of non-white Germans have long been demanding and for what international agreements, such as the anti-racism convention, have to impose Germany, must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.
Generally, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"In terms of man-power and capacity, we can do this," he said to the day mirror.
However, additional money has to be flown into the system for this purpose.
In order to avoid shortcomings, Montgomery calls for health cards to be provided to all arrivals at the same time when registering.
The benefits provided could later be billed with the Länder.
And in the long term, it would be highly questionable to supply as many people with the limited benefit catalogue as provided for by the Asylum Applicant Benefit Act.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly make the language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctoral practice, it calls for interpreter costs.
However, many refugees would already have more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
For example, there are significantly more untreated handicaps among refugee children, and young people are talking about HIV education.
However, with part of the other disease images, German doctors would come out of their training, says Montgomery.
"Parastic attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even be in the sight of relief.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly carry out further examinations.
At least half of the refugees who arrive in Germany are mentally ill, according to the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most people suffer from post-traumatic stress disorders or depressions.
Specially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatically in Germany.
Those who are ill with post-traumatic stress disorders suffer from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, heart rate and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe horrificity and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy at social offices, treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, mostly specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental diseases would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misappraisals, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new stage "Passion", the Circus Prubs relies on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Prabs invites the manege on the brick to wash to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Prubs, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current manege placement.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Prabs.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It's important for us to get people away from their everyday straw and take them to a completely different world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old junior director.
"Manegencocktail with world city flair", says Director Reinhard Probs.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with a joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the stumbling films, it wants to take the Cuban duo easy.
Easyness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatic of the Circus Prubs also fascinates with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing with the one wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatic as little other and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in all respects.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Prübs.
Failures in the holding of circus animals are too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Prübs also commented: "If our animals are not well, we are not good too."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are called lovingly, will be read out as far as possible from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go into the manege either.
So the supreme commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her zebrad Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a zebrastute, the family Prabs is proud.
The two animals lived together for eight years in a gang and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Prabs.
Although the zebride is not yet ready for the manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Prabber.
So for every visitor there is something to do with it.
"One thing is safe," says Stephanie Prubs: "Whether five or 1200 spectators, we always do our best and are with whole heart."
The Circus Prubs invites his ideas every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 20 p.m.
On Sunday the programme starts at 11 and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, prices are reduced for the performance at 5 pm.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 18 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe is holding the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained uninfected, but the video of the case spread quickly via the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also horrified by statements made by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and that they were warned of accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with bouquets.
Last month they had broken him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned them of disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but she has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was " worried" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing company hardware and its service business activities.
The expected job loss leads to a burden of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a wide and deepened portfolio of business that will support companies in the transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual turnover and "will focus on providing companies with unreachable, integrated technology solutions," says a company statement.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical plants and their Palo Alto Garage man called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP’s measure, the world’s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the wounded Jack Wilshere in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasised to Wilshere that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain next summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a major matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated risk of further injuries, always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider image for Arsenal is that in six out of eight games since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have experienced most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and Wenger takes a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to give the players who need a swift break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to move on through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unschlaged after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign started in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured on the judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capitalisation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope of leading the association to its first Europepokal triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm in business for long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become more desperate than ever before, as suicidal rates among young men prove at a 15-year-old height.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than among women.
In order to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably announced 2015 (CALM - Campaign against a Poor Life) as the year of the man to challenge culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "soft mood", his chances of healing doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediateness of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-saving and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which was glossy by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent embraces, moments of football watching in cozy chairs and the desire of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even though they often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As a telephone service staff member told me, "my listener role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you speak openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much my objective outsider status via the phone can also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely new scenery designed to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG shake Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move by to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advance when Cavani reached a headball gate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, as they are not only seeking the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the scores, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances before the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2:0, to create problems and to look back relaxedly, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't reached another or two gates."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2:2 indecisively on his own seat against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was thrown out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing tower was called the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Verratis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he closed by Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat the Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, arrived at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But in addition to a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far by Kevin Trapp's Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes gave up, with some miscarriages and bad results, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in not less than five attempts alone, paved in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a passport from Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the footstep ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan thus reached his sixth season gate, after Ibrahimovic had caught up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was known a gate at the end.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not enough."
Get out of here before Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, affected by invasive raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its huge debt relief plan.
The company registered in London Glencore stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, fights with falling raw materials prices, as China's economic downturn pushes demand and devastatingly affects markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore's stock price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to clear about a third of its $30 billion debts.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the final price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have fallen by 20 to 40 per cent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a most long escape.
The refugees came from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The most recent arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a State visit to the USA at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis' first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and responded to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral discussions.
"President Xi's visit will offer the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington in Seattle before he continues to travel to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial questions, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyberspying in China and its increasing self-consciousness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 from moving to FC Bayern
World and European Champion Xavi has played since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
FC Bayern apparently stood a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who at the time played for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Pocal winners, four times Champions League winners, two times Club champions, two times European champions, one time World champions - Xavi's title list is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells that he was already standing before the EM 2008 in front of the goodbye from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And that also recorded the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
To remember: In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
But the change did not take place.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record master: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why, "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 game time would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bavarians over the entire distance on the lawn, switched off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated at the end the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film making
Matt Damon confronted the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"If we talk about diversity, do it when you occupy the film and not when you occupy the show," Damon assured.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted unbelieving and cried "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the commentary of the actor of The Martian became strong.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to urge people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a bitch beaten by her white sucker.
The producer of Dear White People took the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied that her director could "at the end give us something that we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disappearance about Damon's comments.
Twitter users Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO KNOW it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 Likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white policeman, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved effect across the country and urged legislators and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against colours.
In February, the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said (albs still have their meaning).
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent years, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of Fox news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media molecules invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operating help Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big prize of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just ended its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the seasonal final, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, succeeded until the final.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the effortful phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero talked to E!News after the hard beaten victory, still under shock about the win of the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about that I've never earned or had more than $10,000 for life," Isaac E! said about his crowd of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course at all, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he cares about it.
He's just happy to have done what he did.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a eighth season, which will start in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers pass to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within one half of Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard place.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F word, which was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins make fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support, when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat up 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to make a strong end this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game very focused.
The designated Tiger Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marines on July 6.
"He swinged the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (slag training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the back meeting at the end of the seventh Innings, the twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a color, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man he was confronted with, before the designated Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who entangled a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Innings, Wall created a RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stirred out at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the opening of the game by a Phil Hughes yet unmovable.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two Innings against the right-hand veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than a month because of a spinal pain.
"Of course not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the Leadoff Batter, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"This was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was located in a Pitch count, no points in the third Inning before he was replaced by the Reliever A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez divorced due to an injury to the throwing shoulders.
He was studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the wounded list for a shoulder break, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a cut in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees should live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people traveled there should then be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden told on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 arrival refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hesse capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They should then be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the first admission, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The leader of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He presented the European countries with "collective vision".
Four years ago, we would have been glad that the cup passed a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict lands crawling in front of our doorstep," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
In Germany Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station ORF that no one was sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria either.
"No, that's so agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Safety and Germany's representatives.
She did not call concrete numbers and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria.
Its goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common response in the crisis.
The EU Internal Affairs Ministers intend to take a new start on a special meeting next Tuesday (September 22) on the mandatory distribution of 120 000 more refugees.
In view of the strong refugee tone in Germany, the Union wants to give greater support to the countries in the first generation and distribution of people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection also received them.
However, those who do not have a stay prospect could not stay in Germany either.
This view had been fully shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to deal with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would be locked off with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU differently than Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent Schleppers from looking for escape routes across Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border area.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants went to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice panser of the Saturn Moon Enceladus, a global ocean sways.
This concludes researchers from observations of the "Cassini" space probe.
Thus, the moon dooms easily on its track around the ringplanet.
Although this taumel movement is small, it is too large for a permanently solid celestial body, it is stated in a communication from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the Icarus paper.
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south pole of the Saturn Moon in 2006, spoiling water steam and ice splices, feeding the so-called E-ring of the Saturn.
At least on the South Pole there must be a underground sea, the astronomers closed then.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must renounce offensive Valdet Rama around a month.
An investigation had revealed an additive injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis means "foreseeably four weeks of forced break".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a devastating loss."
"Naturally, we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" letter with a view to the possible commitment of an unified professional.
As a trainee, however, the sixties first presented a defenseman.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the possibility of proving its ability".
Torjager Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after his brain shaking.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is expected to enter the running training.
Okotie had been hurt in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a severe collision on the head.
However, in contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious blazing.
No dietary fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line is often more advised by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Healthy are the exotic fruits, but they contain vitamin B and vitamins E and C. But mainly mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotine.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone tells nothing about how mature the fruit is - so also green mangos can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
But a mango also gives a special note to hearty dishes.
It alleviates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wildlife.
UPS's UPS package service returns to up to 95000 tools for Christmas business in the United States.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS informed on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being searched.
Last year, UPS had increased its staff by 95,000 helpers for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been meeting early arrangements to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought strong criticism to the package services.
First hairdryer, then marked cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the north of the Alps, the hairdryer breaks through, as Meteo Switzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hairdryer blows partly with stormy strength through the hairdryers.
After the end of the hairdryer on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, winds and a temperature decrease.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low pressure area across the British islands in a strong southwester current.
On the north side of the Alps in the night to Wednesday the hairdryer breaks through the valleys.
The hairdryer blows up to Thursday morning in the hairdryer valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km/h, individually and especially in the Urnerland also with over 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can cross into the adjacent middle country, and on the mountains even hurricanes of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday's stormy hairdryer provides summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stuck on the Alps Southhang.
Here is rain that stops until Thursday night.
In total, the south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with partly more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, after large amounts of rain have fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the hairdryer goes out and then a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partially wet rain from West to East.
Together with the cold front, the wind rises strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decline significantly.
The following days are presenting in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Nearly 500 years after the reformation there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German Reformator.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as "German theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded that protesters in the city of Pope for centuries as a minority could often only live in secret.
With the place becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustine monk in Rome around the 1510/11 turn.
At that time, he felt the city as a transgression of sin.
His negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later battle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then started the division of the evening church with his thesis against the decommissioning trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with beautiful pictures.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who made his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colours and fantasy shapes has received the 75-year-old - which is not at all the same meaning as "lovyal" images.
On the contrary, adapted to the subjects, this can seem quite dark.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection of the many themes of the book of all books.
Cycles are created which devote themselves to topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or our fathers.
He spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of painting, has dealt with the respective scriptures.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical citation of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, which expresses his personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewellery tape has golden letters.
Thus the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggering the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrhuter Order.
"There the education happened once with the tube stock," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work this out, maybe to be able to deal with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to bring art back to value in a fast lifetime: "The perception of image worlds is today characterised by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolics are pushed out there.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "since" in the pictures, let them work on themselves, discover and feel the strength they have: "The image is looking for its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt Foundation to have been a lover of Otmar's art: "I like how he understands life with his images."
Old did not care to fully grasp the Bible, but chose the topics important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not cooperation at eye level," Altepost says, "this is about the images, the text explains only".
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "develop his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX train seams
Plans made, found space, company commissioned, Erdhügel modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX train, it was over again.
Failures in politics and administration led to drowning, especially among those who did not want to allow the train.
So lifted hills, searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permit.
The approval will be received in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now communicate to the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope that this year is still happening visible," she said.
It should then begin with the work at the former indoor pool without a "more commemorative break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Bundesliga makes a clear sign on the weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany and ensures that politics helps to address the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the reunification."
"No one can say that's nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be interesting for everyone to handle this issue," said DFB-chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be at the Chancellor's Office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Mrs. Özoğuz, and the Chancellor."
"There the subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football could and would like to help.
But the decisive flexibilities must be the policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius-Braun Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue by 2019," Niersbach explained at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal ligists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will wear the print "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricot sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "image" label (Dienstag) and referred to the project as "safety".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one can look away."
"We football allies can, no, use our radiation power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incrediblely," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "famous sign of the League".
The National Women's Team invites 100 refugees to the Hall/Salle for the EM Qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large joint work of German football".
It is great that all 36 license associations have started their own projects in their places.
It's just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, will live in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, the Association will make 300 000 euros available for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already collected the total amount for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: Head of SAP Management Loss an eye in the event of an accident
According to several reports, the Chief Executive Officer of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost the left eye by a fall in early July.
In the event of an accident on the stairs in his brother's home in the United States, he had fallen on a water glass that he had worn in his left hand after midnight, reports the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, was dizzy, then dragged himself out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
However, McDermott could continue his work.
"In early October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is present at the meeting and "full workable".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually travels between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
He was important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can happen like this."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen down."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except combat ...
Magnussen twittered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he crashed from the wheel.
Thus, during the night race in Singapore in the weekend, he will not be able to receive any reservations for the two master pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, just as one week later at Japan's Grand Prize.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: Weeding Feller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also be missing from the table leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday at 19.00 pm/sky.
"We can't rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga Summit against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB-Coach left open: "We expect a return from him to the training on Friday".
In view of the high stress of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his strain eel on the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the gateguard position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, whether grazing fellers will be used in the future in all Europe-League games, Tuchel left open.
With great probability, he will also deny the second party.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final takeover for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal, finds middlefield player Julian Weigl understandable: "This is not so wrong with Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robot cars: Government wants a leading role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be, in the will of the federal government, a pioneer in the transformation of the car of technology.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA of a "new mobility age".
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and provide less storage, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 States, who also meet at the IAA with representatives of industry.
The Ministry of Transport's Strategy Paper underlines, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and rapid transition to digital radio.
For the testing of new technology, a test track is currently being created on motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to "no additional liability risks" to the driver, the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany intends to make international efforts to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The Federal Government also intends to make a change to the Vienna Convention, which has so far only provided for people as drivers.
When driving automatically, the car is increasingly taking over the driving direction, and the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, high-automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
In spite of this, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport policyman Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars are still skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey submitted on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra audit organisation concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will continue in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, and 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 per cent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, and 33 per cent in the United States.
After all, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely fully on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to carry out control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway it could be imagined in flowing traffic at least 15 percent, in the stau 45 percent.
Well, every four of them would leave the car under no circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Dusseldorfer wants only to win in detail during the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight for a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is, we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the setzlist in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Then Timo also missed, and we became European champions."
"We should focus on this," said the World Ranking Five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has attracted a serious injury to the right leg.
During the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was struck by a fight by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated that the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian pig climber had a rail bone break.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure-gross cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: screenshot dolls that look awkwardly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the child terriblely the skin couture because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, and now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Bürgersteig auf den Laufsteg), which will be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultur Foundation from 18 September, it is a good thing that the fashion creator changed his initially rejective attitude towards a show about his person.
Actually, he had been against, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibitors give an insight into the hardly yet to be overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which a lot of effort has been made: For example, a stylist has been engaged to freeze the dolls.
14 tons of material have been picked up to Munich by the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Just before the beginning of the October party, there was a special slander: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, vivid fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he had worn his Teddy BHs and dresses, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He learned the design of fashion later.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show, he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener tip as fashion niche
Earlier it went into the long embroidery machines and to make plates to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in a large amount for customers who, for example, further processed them into ceilings and curtains.
This alone doesn't work today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Plauen Fashionspitze.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauen's top, fashion played a larger role, then was banned by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: tip in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional paintings.
In general, the so-called Vintage mode, which is based on past style epics, constituted an increasing contract potential.
Whoever does not operate niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and embroidery association, together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, about 80 per cent of turnover has been lost.
Private and wholesale trades are almost out of place.
Our products hardly reach the customers in this way.
The bulk goods are nowadays made much cheaper in the Asian room and are sold almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also attempts to point through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have carried out a quality seal that shows that we are producing ecologically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberger outside office of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroidery and peaks.
In order to counteract competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think mainly economically," Schmidt says.
Therefore, an existing design is often easily varied in order to keep a customer tribe.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small hills in some places.
The Plauen Goldsmith Master Bianca Hallebach-Krosse was inspired by this: "I couldn't start anything with traditional plauen tip before."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an intense process, it embodies the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauen's top - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surroundings and who want a memory.
With this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauener tip.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney still dares to a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly", it is not a re-film, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical babygirl.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Family Banks in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director already stands: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open itself outward in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, a group that was commissioned to manage the reform.
"China should work towards attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new start-ups and to advance reforms will create new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth," said Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of rules on market access, relaxation of border controls policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), including private capital, and revising the population reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it has a greater role to play on the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a state of law business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Further areas will be opened for private investment through an offer to open up state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities and to engage professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as reported in a post-session statement.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in robbery fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large robberies, thereby giving consumers a much higher dose of neurotoxicity.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a relevant EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "Risicos and side effects of industrial and environmental policy failure are passed on to pregnant and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of neurotoxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, should be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for economic reasons.
However, large robberies are already loaded with mercury so much that, on the basis of the remaining limit values, about 50 per cent of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be unselling.
In return for this relief, according to Foodwatch, the EU intends to tighten the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, described this as a "trick", because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low loaded that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The decline in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction manoeuvre that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt said.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is highly enriched over the food chain, especially in robbery fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of unborn people".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, explains on its homepage that, with regard to the applicable maximum values, a "health hazard to the general population" is not expected.
Mercury comes into the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants send more than six tons of mercury every year to the Green Federal Delegate Annalena Baerbock, two-thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and surface-widely exceeded", the "spiegel" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks reported in the EU warning system RASFF.
