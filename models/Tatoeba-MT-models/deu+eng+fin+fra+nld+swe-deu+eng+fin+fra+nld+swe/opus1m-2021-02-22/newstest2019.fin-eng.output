Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane's home win in opening Savo Volley's second victory
After seven consecutive men's football championship medals, Hurricaan-Loima started the season 2018-19 with home win when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective player in Hurricane at 22 points.
There were some stimulus to the outside, but they didn't happen, and then a call from Loimaal came.
A little bit fast, Kouki said.
Like each other in Loimu, Tomi Rumpune's support for Koukia was 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the team searcher Samuli Kaislasalo 17 points with a match-specific agreement.
The win of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought additional extra to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal tube is of course an objective, Kouk said.
Most effective in Savo Volley
Miro Mättänen was at 18 points the most effective Savo Volley when the team crashed next to Vantaan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was awesome, especially at the end of the attack, but fortunately, we got a pressed victory.
At least I had nothing to know about different downloads when I played against my former team, Määlänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the next flight ball in the period 2000-01, made 12 points.
Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, or the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
That's a good guy left out of the home.
Miro was a king, Silli also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's last season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielawater in Sammo when he was also the main coach at that time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective at 14 points.
Mikkone again Akaa Volley's star
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen won the league's score exchange with a strong start in this season.
The hacker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season's opening win after he dropped Kokkolan Tigers 3-2.
The season has started very well from its own point of view.
Of course, today was a loss close, because we had the fourth one in the 17-21 loss.
They were digged somewhere a batch win, and the fifth batch came there at the same time, Mikkone said.
A few years ago, the most effective of the Tigers was the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudriashovs supported 17 points.
I didn't get much of a shot at the guy's hacker, Mikkone praised.
Finland in comparison of human capital world one
Finland is the world's top point in the comparison of human capital, says scientist Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the first in statistics.
In 2016 the quaint was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands were after Finland.
Later, the Netherlands was placed on one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016 the worst comparison was between Niger and South Sudan.
Measurement of human capital examines the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico disciplined, local game ended unpainted
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois went to great fights, and the local game of the Madridian teams ended to a paintless match late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the nearest painter, but the Belgian guard Courtois had time to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico through three of his bribes when he played Chelsea's player.
In the beginning of the week, Fifa chose him to be the goalkeeper of the year.
In the real, Gareth Bale got the best goal spot, but his shot was directed past the end of the goal opening half.
After a break, Bale left for a change because of a throat wound.
According to the ESPN, the disappointed supporters of Real cried the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juvento.
In the United States, we are now attacking abortion law - the powerful document tells us why
The United States Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by President Donald Trump’s candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive voice of Kavanaugh would be repealed by a decision known as Roe Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg’s documentary film Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights tells us how the current situation has occurred over the years.
As unbelievable as it feels, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (I) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of the people of our country.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in Missouri.
The armed guard of the clinic says he's defending American freedom of religion.
News videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortions.
The reasonings of the admonished pastor are good, but in fact, they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of his abortion.
There were deaths in the United States for about 5,000 years.
In particular, the Republican party defended the legalisation of abortions.
In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the abortion law in California.
Later, specifically in his presidential campaign in 1980, Reagan began reversing religion with politics in order to bring voters into the market.
His abortion was also rounded by his successor George Bush parent.
And the same thing did Donald Trump.
In the deepest core of the matter, the document goes beyond looking for a basic reason for politising abortion.
When tax exemptions were denied from religious organisations that supported racial separation, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a beef horse.
Religion has brought exceptional claws into politics.
In writing this, in the United States, a situation is where the president, who has taken the voices of religious right in his oral tribulation, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, which many women are now accusing for sexual tribulation.
Kavanaugh can get the waa'anglophone power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, among two children, on the border of great demonstrations
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has fired demonstrators in the border zone.
Israel's soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border on Friday, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded with bullets.
Israel’s army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air attack on the border zone when the protesters threw Israel’s forces with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has begun the use of force that the mindpointers will not break the border line or strive to the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, there are 12 000 injured.
The protesters demanded access to Palestinian families to areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosions from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and agricultural lands in Israel.
Theme Santa got a punishable kick... he couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's top Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a backlog on the penal zone.
Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the cab was clean.
Theme Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation stayed to bother Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a sentence of 85 minutes when Santa was fallen.
Ward looked like a punishment spot, and Mario Vrancic filled the 1-0 win ball.
Santa has made five goals for Norwich in the championship series.
Last Saturday, the last one was born against QPR with a stylish chest pang.
The work was tasted again for Puk.
After losing the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created target situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the game was the fifth in two weeks.
The team's going to continue in the league cup.
There's a five-win tube behind.
Pedophils Help Service immediately completed reservations - About 40,000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in my prospective age.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
To date, it has been difficult for children or young people who are sexually interested to get help.
The Joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, in the Sexpo offering advice and therapy, the email flare and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released in the autumn.
The sexual preference of children is a shame for many.
Most of the pedophil feelings of themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is generally a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that afflict and depressed them.
They also complicate normal life, says the sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a special expert in the project.
I think the work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Core leaders or Congolese gynaecologist?
The idea of US President Donald Trump Nobel as the winner of the Peace Prize may sound strange, but on the basis of the bets, Trump is one of the biggest favourite winners of the prize.
The background is the role of Trump in obtaining North Korea at least at speech level to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest popular Nobel peace recipients are the South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the choirs is remarkable, because the intervals between the choirs were still good last year.
Nevertheless, the reward of Kim, who has been threatening for years with nuclear weapons and with iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be published from Monday, and Friday will be the most attentive, namely the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those who participate in the diplomacy of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates is Denis Mukwege, a Congolese doctor.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a well-known gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rapes and has become the leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is an aggravating by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been regarded as a UN refugee organisation who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has stated that this year the award will be awarded by 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't hurt if Nobel could.
In May, the reporter asked him in the White House whether he deserved the Peace Prize.
Everyone thinks that, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to the negotiations in North Korea.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often recognised the people and organisations who represent liberal democracy and a pluralist world order - just the international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent of.
In the 21st century, the award has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological translation of the Nobel Committee.
Fire Report in the tunnel: Drivers acted like cockpits and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chassis that occurred at the 1st Lahti took place on 8 September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted due to the notification in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this is a systemic problem, the fire station tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once earlier, but the Road Transport Centre said that it cannot be opened because on the road there are car riders of a swine shock and they drive how to hurt, the emergency firemaster Pasi Kääriäinen told the STT at the time.
At that time the motorway was left to drive even in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act against the traffic rules, some others often follow after, the Head of Transport Safety contact Tapio Heiskanen is surprised.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must only stop for a compelling reason.
Road safety reminds us that in exceptional situations, we cannot go away to endanger traffic by means of urgent solutions.
Alert vehicles shall always be provided as easy as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as well as making a U translation and revoking.
The same bans are also applicable in tunnels where, in addition, the lights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as of course parking is also prohibited.
Previously there have been even cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow in his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this operation, says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Bulletin.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party even though the ship was caught in the seabed.
The Ilves fans transported by M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on the ship to continue their winning party, even though the ship had been caught in the seabed, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's chief at the time of the event.
The M/S Tampere travelled from Tampere to Tampere on Saturday nights and was caught in the bottom of his throat at Vanajawater in Akaa.
19 passengers on board and five crew members were evacuated to the continent at night.
No one was hurt in the harbour.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them by fire station rides to the port and bus home, Syrjä said to STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinnan following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the 4-3 win of Ilves.
According to the Syrinen, on Saturday, the hay was due to the water surface at Vanajawater being about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrja, it was also difficult to navigate that the nearest sign was covered by logs, so its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark night.
No more specific collision
Haveri occurred on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalm, a short time after the ship route had undergone the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrja, there was no greater drama in the case, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the bottom caused a more significant collision.
According to the ship, the fastening in the bottom has not caused leaks or pressures on the ship, and from this point of view, the crossings of the ship continue normally.
The diver visited the ship on Saturday morning before the ship started to deflection.
For the sake of certainty, we will still go to the shipyard to check that this did not cause any damage, says Syrja.
The Syrians believe that the next M/S Tampere cruise, next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season of the ship will continue until the day of independence.
No use in ambulances
The rescue facility received an alarm from the case on Saturday night after a little half a year after 12 months.
The port of Viala was alerted to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use of the ambulances.
A friend of firemaster Matti Willman told me late evening that evacuation conditions in the sea were difficult due to darkness and rather heavy wind.
After half three, the Birkaland rescue facility informed the Sunday-after night that all of the ships have been evacuated and that passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trumpi's judge candidate for tribulation and drinking may not have a top position.
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as U.S. Supreme Court Judge, may well fail to hold the post she seeks, evaluates programme manager Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to the Wave, the doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump can end up presenting another person.
In the United States, there has been some occasions when the president's candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of conflicts.
In this case, the judge’s candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
That's how the president has been able to keep his face.
The name would lead to the ladder of the Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but, at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a very sensitive political process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to rain into the democratic party's chamber in the forthcoming elections to the Congress.
It would increase the voting imperfection among young people and women who would be more likely to vote democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for every presidential term, since in the United States the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70-80 years.
Part of the Republicans also hesitates to appoint
The U.S. Supreme Court's candidates for judges are normally subject to a background statement, says Aaltola.
Even though Trump has ordered the FBI's additional report for only a week, it can still, according to Aaltola, bring something important to the attention.
Well, it might bring you.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to the wave, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inappropriateness to serve is still being discussed vigorously before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicanists are thought to be suspicious about the appointment of Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would be lost.
The woman identified the suspect Salisbury as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told BBC that she recognizes Salisbury's poison as a suspect Russian officer's military intelligence agent.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman told me that this is a military briefing at the GRU, Anatoli Tshepiga.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported that they had previously revealed one of the suspected men of poisoning to Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they found evidence that men's present identities are covert identities.
The BBC group travelled to Far East near the border between Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman in the village identified the pictures published by the young Chepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from the pictures of the British police in which Ruslan Boshirov appeared to be a man now called himself.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The scripts survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, by the honorary mark of Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still denies the GRU of the suspect.
Men suspected of poisoning reported earlier in September when they interviewed Russian TV as tourists in Salisbury.
Old people as a throwing wall in war reform
Now we have a living example of what the change limit for the war reform defined by the government of Sipela in practice means.
My municipality of Vaala's war services are produced by the municipality of Oulunkaare, whose former Regional Director of Attendo has been elected as the Health Services Director in 2016.
The Heads of the Municipal Association shall warn the delegation against the change limit.
If the war spending rises now, the state aid of the municipality will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers in the municipality were scared, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the institutional care of the Health Centre's bed department and the small memory hospital unit.
Home care would be added, which means that older people living in remote villages are cut off to be treated next to the health centre.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left left of the elections did not swallow up bad preparations, but organised a good public conference, with many relatives, close caregivers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented the preparations for the war county in the municipality of Vaala with the treatment of the elderly at the moment at home most throughout the Nordic region.
It was also attended by Carina Westinen, a member of the neighbourhood.
The local magazine made a big deal about the occasion, and it again lifted the Oulunkure editors on his back legs.
The war preparers do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursery house in Vala, which now awaits empty inhabitants.
There are no other service providers.
Manufacturers only speak of service bills, but don't tell you what level of care it receives or with what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until the end of the treatment.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the establishments of the Health Centre are discontinued because there is no doctor’s nightclub.
Attendo will also rely on Vaala Health Centre’s doctors.
The example of Valalan shows how central officials operate with the poorest knowledge, and the authorising officers are pushed back to the wall with a change limit.
Thus, the Central Party clears the inhabitants of Vaala, because whoever stays in a safe place to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there one vote in the centre that the whole country should be inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a big mosque in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in the city of Cologne showed their minds when the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visited the country opened a mosque of Europe's largest.
Hundreds of people had been gathered on the Rhine River beach since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held and security measures have been rigorous.
On the streets in Cologne, approximately 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
There had also been supporters of Erdogan in the vicinity of the big mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan commended his German visit to be successful and estimated that it strengthened the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During her visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel swore that they would rebuild relations with countries that have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 power-taking attempt.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between countries, inter alia, on human rights issues.
Review Surrounds Visit
Both the director of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, canceled their participation in the opening of their review of Erdogan's visit.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said that he had come to a protest against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last step of the Erdogan German journey in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three charges for the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the Attorney told me that three people are being charged with Kuciak and his fiancée's perlent murder and other crimes.
Previously this week, the police arrested eight people in the investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found, shot in February, with his fiancé in Bratislava.
He had investigated the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected that the murders are related to each of them.
The case and Kucia’s published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the livestock distribution on Sundays in disparate areas
Due to the defect of printing, the Karianian will also have to be mailed without address on Sunday.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in areas of dispersion where distribution into common boxes is required from outside memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The poster puts extra press sticks in the province.
The magazines of other Finnish subscribers will only be posted separately on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala in his future discussion programme today.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her coming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
At a price of EUR 151,000, the bank loan was required to pay.
If the original plans were true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after a failure, which occurred in 2014, and also demanded a test flight, things are fair.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will still begin this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa flight number is 300, i.e. his journey is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and in unprinted condition is 5 minutes at a height of 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells about its future home page.
At the same address he also backgrounds his desire for space.
When I was a child, I read a comic magazine called Space Travel and I saw Star Trek on TV.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's what the idea left to do.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a loud host
Manchester City continued his unforfeited journey in the Valioliiga when it crashed on Saturday in his homefield with Brighton's 2-0 goals.
The painters Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero serve as guarantors of the sixth victory of the ruling champion's bag.
Sterling was allowed to drive the season's fourth hit from near to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in 30 minutes at the back of the Brighton goal.
Agüero raised his own payroll to five when he saw Sterling and Brighton in pieces of the 65th minute game.
The Argentinian was able to invest the 2-0-end licenses easily in the case of a penal scourge.
With six wins and one match, City, which started the season, leads the Valioliiga with 19 points catches.
One game less played Liverpool, however, is only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his own seventh round match with the three-series Chelsea.
Youth associations chose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting ended Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations chose new decision-makers for their next three-year year 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Upper Savoo was elected President and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
The delegation was elected by 40 members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Associations will inform on Sunday.
The youth meeting was held in Joensu.
We want our cultural activities to be known about quality and safety.
The Youth Conference, held in River Sue, gives three promises in its three-year operational objectives: we keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal hobby activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people with their own growth methods, the Finnish Youth Society reports in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikko and amazed Ferraria: "Get off a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blicki, the British driver of Mersu was asked whether he believed that the release of Kimi Räikköse from Ferrar services would help Hamilton in the rest of the period.
Hamilton leads Ferrar's second driver Sebastian Vetel at MM points with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't believe that Räikkönen would hit the tits.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional, a fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his previews.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula one, I played F1 game on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian sub-competition.
The Mercedes St.Bottas will be leaving for the race starting at 14:00.
The evening will follow the race for a moment.
The championship of the A-young SM series became a full farse: the opponent arrived only with the power of 7 players
The top level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before 13:00 a.m., the starting points for the championship campaign were clear: FC Lahti for the Academy is practically sufficient for the first place against Vasa IFK.
In order to change the situation in the last round, the second Ilves in the championship campaign must win the PK-35 and wish for the Latijns' loss.
However, the Lahti championship was practically assured before the start of the indignation, because Vasa IFK had only arrived in Lahti with the power of seven players.
If there had been one less of the Vaasans, then the game could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Gulf led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Waasian gamblers is the fact that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-young SM series, the P20 series, and the Men's Second C block.
Vasa IFK has played in practice against the fall of the whole season.
On Saturday, on the 2nd round, Vasa IFK has to win JBK in the visitor's fight and hope that Tampere United will lose its own visitor's fight against KuFua in Siilinjärven Toivali.
The car ended up on the roof on Eno, according to the rescue facility, the luck was involved.
The passenger car drove out of the road and ended up on Uncle's roof on a case risk Sunday at 9:00.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue department informs.
Good luck was involved, the press release says.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet from the rain.
The police patrol was at the accident site.
Supo expects new ways of inquiry: Equipment purchases and recruits have already been made, the activities planned abroad are not delayed
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
In the event of the entry into force of the information laws, a permanent increase of around EUR 10 million should be made.
In the premises of the protection police (supon) located on the Helsinki Road, a full decision is already being prepared for the entry into force of the Enquiry Laws.
Antti Pelttari, head of Supo, tells the Western Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is thrilled with a video where she sings in the topless, campaigning for breast cancer awareness.
Tennis' superstar Serena Williams is getting better again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video of his Instagram account, where he only sings his hands in front of his breasts, reports the news office AFP.
The song is the 1991 Australian The Divinyls hit I Touch Myself.
With this video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voted The Divinyls global hit to remind women of doing regular self-sufficiency [beasts] checks," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the discomfort area, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women regardless of the skin color around the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it scares many lives.
The Divinyls' second song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
Music video is part of the I Touch Myself project that has been made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer, but gave us a hitch to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for his courage.

Chinese restaurant on a mountain road is not suitable for peak horrors
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves great landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located in the rock tongue.
From there, if you want to look at the forest spreading below.
The gorgeous landscapes at the high altitudes make restaurant guests rush their lives in the Longquan mountains.
To get to the restaurant requires walking in the middle of peaches trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's toilet is located.
Walking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
The Corpela pit runs out today: This is how everything ends
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is what happens to the domestic country drama of Korpela's alley, which has been quite kept.
The third production period has gone like hot stones: last week, the TV saw 722 000 Finns as the first edition.
The peak figures in themselves have no practical significance anymore, because Heikki Creation and Jukka Mäkise series will not continue.
In the final episode, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku will be taken back on the head, and I think Jaska’s mother will guess first what to come.
In the light of recent events, too, the Anssin and Miisa are very romantic, but then there is once again Laiho.
The police also have a suspicious position with a man.
But no one can imagine Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, hears incredible news.
The last will of far comes out, which makes a woman's tears to the beard.
A week later, in Sunday times, the latest episodes of Sorjone will continue.
The Corpela alley runs today on TV1 at 21.05.
Is it worth working on a little flu tomorrow?
Here's the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many lots of lots will stay home or not.
However, the shop should consider whether others should go to infection, because the disease may be infectious even if their symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the influenza suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the hips.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even though your symptoms would feel small, reports the Prevention publication.
So you should stay home?
Prevention says that the flu is infectious even when the person himself does not have any symptoms.
The virus is infected a day before the symptoms start and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can return to work when the cough is slow and there is no more fever, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
It's also worth avoiding the workout.
Too fast returning to the hall slows recovery.
Remember, wash your hands, put them in a nasal cloth, and throw the wreck paper into the garbage.
But, you know, you're a painful move?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective machine.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
It is also limited to the machine.
Then how could we avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average man touches his eyes, his nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the Miss Tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice hockeyer and boys are often combined.
That was also the case with Alina Voronkova, paragraph 23.
For the year 2018, Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa has received the award of Miss Finland's crown.
Today, the beautiful woman lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15 years old.
Alina's mother is Finnish and father Russian.
For father's Russians, Voronkova was tempted at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted by my Russians.
In the country I had no friends at all, Alina tells us at the semifinals of the Miss Finland contest.
After graduation, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to the Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the Missy Queen found new friends and the ark left to roll hopefully.
When you're 15 years old, you think you're an adult, but I wasn't really, after that.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Jonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans rows.
After a career in the SM League, a hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
At the beginning of the meeting, the couple lived in almost a year’s distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the triangle of the winners, and then I would get a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Although we would have to live apart, we do well with confidence and a distance relationship is the good side of keeping it as an initial stone all the time, Alina ran in May.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere bumped to the kar at the Holy See - "Standy stuck with the rock"
Inland watercraft M/S Tampere drove late on Friday night at Akaa in the Holy See.
The rescue facility was alerted for a water traffic accident on Friday night at half a year after 12 months.
A 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drove into a raid, and is firmly stuck with a rock, described the day-to-day firemaster Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue facility, personal damage was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the continent from the ship.
Now they are transferred by bus drive to Tampere, said the emergency chief Jari Nieminen to the STT at one in the night.
Ambulans were alarmed to take evacuated passengers to the port of Viiala.
For some reason, a ship traveling from the Peninsula to Tampere had left its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police'll find out the reason for the events.
A friend of firemaster Matti Willman told me earlier this evening that the conditions in the lake are difficult because of darkness and rather heavy wind.
According to the rescue facility, the ship's destiny is unclear.
Apparently, the ship doesn't leak.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will start checking the situation at the bottom.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship, with the maximum number of passengers allowed for 180 persons.
A meeting room shall also be rented for private use on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid rewards from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's night fight against Erkan Teperi is shading the money dispute.
Today, the evening announcements newsed to Boxing Manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila for a challenge application, where Helenius is charged with a total of over EUR 80,000 unpaid management fees, with its late interest rates.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate, and work has been done very much, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanoma.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent the Iltalehti in response to the events, telling the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
In response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially difficult situation to Helenius and promised that they would be able to organize matches and sponsorships for him.
It was literally agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay rewards only for percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only receive the income they arranged.
This is also a normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
No agreement has ever been reached on wage work and that would also have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
In response, Helenius would have wished to agree on the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He noted the proposal as an abomination for himself and discontinued cooperation with Kokkila and Helmis.
Helenius did not fight once when he was dealing with Kokkila and Helmis.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned a "unidentified but large" bill of the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been brought before the Court.
Helenius considers the post-contractual activity of Helmis and Kokkila as poor, in return, is noted.
Helenius today meets the boxing union in Stuttgart, Erkan Teper, the seventh challenger of the heavy series of the IBF.
Hearted man and good journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio felt that the radio player and journalist Erkki Pälli had disappeared for decades.
Radio runner and journalist Erkki Pälli died to unhealed liver cancer at 83 years of age.
The rapper's death report was published on Sunday in Helsinki's Sanom.
The notification tells me that Pälli died on 3 September.
In March 2018, he told me about a serious disease on his Facebook page.
At that time the publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was sad about the fate of the familiar.
He left on Facebook earlier, like a goodbye, Ile Vainio says.
The persecution sees Erkki Päll as a multi-gifted partner, who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Pällin was a man who had a quick hoxot and fun stuff.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy when I was 12 years old and started there as a warehouse man.
That's when we met Erk.
He was then Finnlevy's reporter and at different tasks, Ile Vainio remembers.
As a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor of all the artists that were doing at the party.
He was always expert and saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin to interview him.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
To many he became familiar with Yle's respected radio talker, but he also wrote great newspaper stuff.
Erkki interviewed me many times, too.
He was good to talk, Paranoia praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to the editorial work at the Fazer-levy company with Hope Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on the albums of Vesa-Matti Loir.
However, the greatest passion of the game was a radio work in which he had a distinctive style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar with numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
He retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Ski Federation announced that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of about EUR 450 000.
The Federation describes the "complete translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is certainly burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid reaction and strong economic discipline.
We will respond to this situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
The careful planning and economic management of the operation has hit through all of our organization, Winkela reports in the newsletter.
We have also succeeded well in partnering and, in addition, the world cup yield was maximum in the past competition period.
However, cost management must continue to be accurate and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife shouting, but then there was silence.
Twenty bodies lie in the hospital's backyard in the city of Palau on the Indonesian island of Sulawes.
Only one building distinguishes those areas from those in which damaged survivors have been collected to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside because of afterbearings.
One of the residents in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returnee, Baharudd, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I was talking to him the last time he went to school, Baharuddin told the AFP news office.
Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries in his back and arm, was located in the army hospital garden in Palau.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the return wedding party.
I probably fell under the wall that fell into the pressures.
I heard my wife shouting help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe," Haris told the AP news office according to the British media.
Small shops are robbed
At the return evacuation centre, the 35-year-old mother of the baby Risa Kusuma tried to calm down her fever.
He described the atmosphere in town as tense.
There's little clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma told me.
Many of the people of the Fire have slept outside or in temporary bamboo.
Even if the household would be in a position to stand, any subsequent earthquakes could destroy it forever and bury the inhabitants alone.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
It is known that there were about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 escapers.
Some of the prisoners in the Donggala Prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the magazine, the prisoners were angry and fired into the prison after the guards had forbidden them to go looking for their relatives suffering from earthquakes and tsunamis.
The return airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first ones, the military's C-130 plane landed in the field and brought back supplies.
Commercial flights to the return field are only allowed on a limited basis.
Pilots will have to land on the ground without the help of the flight management, because the flight management tower was severely damaged in the earthquake.
Rain wipees over Finland at night
A long rainy area spreads across the earth on Sunday night in the west direction, reports the Climate Science Department.
Precipitation comes mostly as water, but in Central and North Lap there is expected rain or snow.
The kickers of the last night are not recurring because the temperatures under cloudy cover remain higher.
The cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures quite efficiently controlled.
In the west, you can visit the frozen side for a moment, said the emergency meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area moves eastwards over the morning.
South and west, there's wood or half clouds.
In the afternoon temperatures are always moving up to the height of the Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week looks similar for temperatures in the southern and middle parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
In the marine areas, wind and wave warnings are in force.
Real storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typically varied weather in autumn.
Yes, the autumn is starting to blow up seriously, the Ilkka said.
Miss Finland's final is not seen on TV
From the IL TV you will be able to track the red carpet glamour and radius of the Miss Finland competition.
The evening entertainment journalists on the IL TV draw direct broadcast from the red worm of the Miss Finland final from Billnasse's food.
Sending starts around 18:50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday with ten finalists.

Other representatives of the court are the well-being entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Trade Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiskan news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped that he would go to college before he went to the Missiles.
The Russian Dimitri father and the Indian mother Svetlana believed their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, parents of Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, followed the first times of their daughters in the head.
They came to the audience from Pertunland and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before we came, we started to get excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Indian and Dimitri Russian.
Alina speaks a smooth Russian, even though she has lived all her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells me that Alina was a little more interested in acting and many other things than any career.
Alina was often told that when she's so beautiful, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio runner.
Only later did Alina get excited about the beauty competitions.
Parents wished that Alina would be able to attend the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and finally, Alina wanted to do the exam before the matches.
We already asked last year why he didn't take part, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults as well.
He sports a lot and eats healthyly.
And Alina likes to be on display, it's visible.
Alina's boyfriend, Jonas Hurri, is working ice hockey in Japan, and he couldn't get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts for the past year.
Yes, that's what we're supposed to do!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit us soon.
Now there's been so much break in the visits because of the missiles.
I'm already missing, even if there's some messages.
A young man died in overtime in Lahti. The police caught three people.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a mother home in Finland - the idea of the comic was lost: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband once made a statement proposing it to be a person as a story I developed, says the Espoo comic blogger, home mother and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says he was an EU translator of economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I'm really enjoyed as a home mom.
This has been the best time in my life, but at some point it remembered what the big one would do when even the smallest child began to be big.
Then 2014 came a comic.
Pippo tells me that he had never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Aku Anka, Tintti and Asterix from a small age.
The last time I had drawn when I was a child, then when these manuscripts of the Creative Dough began to be born, the situation changed.
At first, I made a few dozen manuscripts in the desk box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled designer, but I couldn't get her attracted until the summer of 2016 when I donated the Vivi with a drawing disc.
His enthusiasm lasted a decade of stripping, and then he had to start trying himself to laugh at the Pippo who tells him that the drawing record was a great incentive for him.
Drawing disc is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something in time.
To the paper I didn't even try to draw, tells Piper about his relationship to drawing, which he usually has at night.
Manuscripts are constantly popping in mind, but usually I don't make it ready at once.
One of the three screens takes even several hours.
I might do the screen at a time, and I'd love to play with the colors.
Begin drawing is always the most difficult thing, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the current series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
As humans of the organic ham, the mother of the carrot body of the L-theme has been gorgeous with a salad hairdress.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the world of the organic hatch, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Pippo doesn't want to preach or offer a drill, even though the Creative Hope is intruding.
Piper says he reads his series with his husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the comic you've drawn and you're saying that I've done this today.
And the challenges are enough for home mom!
You can read the series on the web at the site of organic homppa.serialblogit.com

Indonesian earthquake: Air traffic leader sacrificed himself - didn't leave a breaking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old airmaster, has risen into a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the flight management tower until hundreds of people were transported safely from the island shaken by the earthquake.
The young person was in charge of the flight management of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie in Palu City, when the earthquake struck on Friday.
When others escaped from the Agung flight management tower, they refused to leave their place before they were driven by Batik Air's passenger plane to the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told the AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was waving and breaking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he got serious inhalations.
Agung was sent to a close hospital.
He was supposed to be transported to a better equipped facility with a helicopter, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a representative of the aviation administration told The Jakarta Post.
The shock continued to increase when the flight came into the air, and its strength was finally measured by 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroicity in social media.
Rehn was thinking about Europe's end to the trade war: "We need to look at the following twist"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the entire world economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Finnish Bank has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
President Rehn said at Yle's first meeting that although the excitement does not have any direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, reflecting investment decisions by companies.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is well at work for the moment.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to fall into the foot of the trade war.
I need to look at the next twitter and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in the interview with Yle.
There are also own risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the West.
The market reacted sharply yesterday on Thursday night by the Italian Government to clearly present the deficit budget.
The deficit next year is more than 2.4 per cent of the population.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's borrowing rate is problem credits and unorganized credits are more than ten per cent.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country seems to go beyond its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps we should not paint new crises yet, Rehn answered when he was asked whether Italy would bring the new economic crisis in Europe.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in agreement.
The difference in dispute would be much more negative.
Rehn started as President of the Finnish Bank in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) will withdraw his duties in a fair year.
The debate with his follower has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikase has whispered.
It is probably no problem if the Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he will not comment on this further.
HS' super-recommended Black Box presentations will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organized by Helsinki Sanomi will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other proposals will be presented at the National Theatre on 2 and 8 and 11 October.
23 October The Black Box is visiting the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets on sale for the National Theatre.
The Tampere show has been sold out.
Tickets sell Tickets.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers will tell the facts they have prepared for a long time and have not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's again something that no one has ever heard.
"It's a strange spy at the night of Helsinki, impressing your report from the other side of the world and talking a story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and to continue the discussion.
The News of Helsinki have arranged live journalism nights for three years.
They have been popular and often finished selling from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already been in the lobby.
The black box was rewarded in the Bonnier gala as a journalistial act of a year.
The winners thanked a new way of doing journalism and journalists want to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 The Black Box will be seen at National Theatre in March-April.
It is also a visit to Tampere and Turku.
The presentation to be seen at that time has different contents than in the evenings of this age.
The missing fungus was found due to "unpredictable experiment"
Finnish police drone expertise is the top of the world: "We are asked about training"
According to the Director of the High School of Police, the police may use the drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in the field of criminal investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the police of Oulu managed to find the drone of the missing fungus in Raahe only in a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Director of the High School of Police, commented on the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with unpredictable experimentation and effective education we are the world's top".
Drone's quite a new invasion, and even more new in police duties.
There is no statistics anywhere about Finnish police being a master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is true.
This has been clear, for example, when the Finnish police experience has been reported in international events.
There's a terrible interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There would be a lot of crowded visitors to look at the Finnish police's drone activity.
We're being asked for training.
More generalized
Himberg recalls that finding the missing person in Finland's winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As I said, in the case of Raahe, a lost person was only found with a drone in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're supposed to be trained more.
Even now, the drone is being used in a lot of police tasks, and its use will expand and increase in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for the missing, the police believe Himberg can use drones, for example, in the accident or crime scene investigation and in certain types of intelligence tasks.
For example, we already have to check a region a little further, where it may be fearable that there is violence.
Drone can be used for pre-enquiry purposes.
Karjalan's Rugby got up to the first diver.
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2nd Division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Riversuians were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss for the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found the run and squirt the visitors in the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew Karelia's Rugby's historical rise to his 1-division.
Previously, the company has played in one, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and several blocks of the 1-division.
The company intends to take the serial place, but it will know a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
As a 1-division, the number of games is also known to increase and longer gambling trips, so funding must also be in line with that.
Cotcaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms the main coach
The main coach of the Montreal Canadiens at the ice hockey NHL, Claude Julien, confirmed the company's Twitter account that the Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked the super promise of Cotkaniemen, 18, in the first round number three summer reservations.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in the end of the summer and has presented strong extracts in the September training matches.
In the first exercise, the Eagle Eagle was able to make a goal.
Coach Julien commended the Finnish to take major development steps after arrival in the entry camp.
The NHL framework series begins next week in the night against Thursday in Finland's time.
Montreal's meeting on the Toronto Maple Leafs opening tour.
What's a good leader?
This week, a lot has been said about management in Finland.
The president of Nokia's government, Risto Siilasmaa, in the interview of the HS, told his book Paranoide optimist, in which he illuminated the leadership of his philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollia.
Ollila strongly contested the accusations, but in the previous Nokia reports there was talk about the inability of managers to act as a team; the fear and intelligence, which in part caused a collapse of mobile business.
The ability to take risks and to steeply increase the company disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum, which attracted the Finnish Business Cream, was also held in Helsinki.
In addition to Barack Obama, the star of the 12 business world rose up on the stage.
There was enough talking about good management.
Gary Hamel said that the good leader should dare to take the company into the future even when the company goes well.
The problem is that decisions are taken by those who are mentally most linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods Whole Foods trading chain from a wide variety of organics, said that the director should know the entire staff about the company's purpose.
And that cannot be just making profits to the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts of the success book, told me that the most successful leaders were investigated with humility.
They act peacefully, quietly and determinedly.
Often they're introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance, reminded us that the qualities of the good director must be met with the company's life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company growing up in a mature phase needs a director who knows the numbers.
These teachings at the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
As a danger, they had a source of information.
There's a lot to ask for from a good leader.
That is why management is so often misleading, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked together in the scenes.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge from outside.
Sara Chafak arrived in a beautiful red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of his year abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missifinal in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 dress of Miss Finland also had a pitse lava.
A little pod jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
For a long time, I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me about his hearings.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A. on the trials.
He has made advertising descriptions, among other things.
Work in the United States he describes as interesting, and also similar to in Finland.
However, he believes that work must be done more hardly, as the model work can easily be replaced by a replacement.
You have to jump harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreograph for Sonya Lindfors Live Art Award of EUR 30 000 in Kuopi
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth EUR 30,000 on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they have previously been missing described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were candidates for awards.
The award will be awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating on the field of live art.
The Danish police found a big Volvo searched for in the operation: "We can't tell you where"
The large searches of the Danish police have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation the traffic was closed at the Juutinrauma and the Great Belt times.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Shelland was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the head of the media centre of Copenhagen's police.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We can't tell you yet where the car was found, Henrik Storm on the Copenhagen police information tells the evening-Sanoma.
According to Storm, the black Volvo searched for has no direct connection to the threat, according to the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Ekstra Bladet told the police about the briefing on Saturday.
Jørgen Bergen Skov, the director of the investigation, was at the end of the shutter line operation.
He didn't want to tell me what the crime name was to investigate.
But Skov told me it's a serious crime.
It was a threat to human life.
Three people have been searched for at the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been caught.
According to the magazine, the restrictions on ship transport have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police also followed events in their Twitter account.
The STT says, however, that there is no longer any reason for concern for a large audience, because the threat faced certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of disparities - now the people vote on it in disputed elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name.
According to the agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, it would be called the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
Greece has so far prevented Macedonia's efforts to become a member of the NATO and of the EU in its veto law.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports the membership of the EU and NATO in Macedonia by adopting the agreement.
At least the school in the centre of Skopje of the capital began the vote.
The retired nurse at school, Olivera Argirosvka, hoped to support the agreement.
The referendum means a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, an independent Macedonia has been named in official connections to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
The National Right-wing Opportunity, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for the referendum to be boycotted.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the voting time rises beyond the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-third majority of Parliament is required for a constitutional amendment.
The Greek Parliament also has to adopt the agreement.
The voting stations close at eight nights in Finland.
That's a great victory!

Canada fights time to reach an agreement from Nafta with the USA
Time threatens the end of negotiations between the United States and Canada in the context of the Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a limit on Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian Head Negotiator, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chrystia Freeland postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement in Nafta.
At the end of August Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but agreement with Canada has not yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before the presidential elections in Mexico won by Mr Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that the involvement of Canada in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that there is plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - was involved in Canada or not.
In view of these schedules, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow the United States Congress sufficient time to assess it.

The table disturbed his butterfly swim at the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablettivi have progressed to the finals of swimming World Cup 3/7 on the final day of the competitions in the Netherlands.
You're going to swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Tablestone was dismayed by Finland's record in a butterfly swing of 50 metres, where he was the second in the first lots in the time of 22.82.
Previously, in September, the table was swimming in Helsinki on the SE-time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukonen, representing Espoola Cetus, was 24,68 in the 24th season of the butterfly swimming.
Swimming Club Leukanen was at the beginning of the 50 m brush in the sixth time 30.48 and moved to the final.
In the first two hundred meters of confusion, Laukkanen was in the 15th century 2.14.25.
Students play a rare taste: antique tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects with their visuality
Antique tragedies are rare in Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Academy of Theatres brought to the National Theatre tour the only whole of the ancient play trilogy, Aiskhylus Oresteian.
In the Lavat open! projects started in 2015, actors at Theater Högskola work internationally with a professional director.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
In April, Oreste was given an international first night in Berlin.
Roiha’s reconciliation from Oresteia summarises the report on the end of the bloodshed of the Atreus family convicted of destruction and the birth of the rule of law earnestly for twenty minutes, especially by tightening the chorus.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to Kirsti Simonsuure’s fine finnish (2003) spirit.
Dramatic lights and the pages of the theatre space revealing presentation highlight the simplified and bright thinking of the stage.
In the middle of it is the dynamics between disconnected, name-playing performers, and choir.
The proposal uses both dual and tripartite interpretations of the name roles.
The actors are not leaving the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Troy War, and this hostage of Kassandra, are shown on the scene, unlike in the ancient presentation strategy.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient style of presentation.
Rather, before the viewer’s eyes a modern, text loyal interpretation is created, which is constantly aware of his ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out the masterpiece students as a close group, actually as one organism, of a rhythmic group.
Especially in choir parts, actors who tend to be very expressive, sculptive group formations can access their rights with a pale, only by decorating a white precursor, on the stage.
Impressive.
The Oresteia tour will continue at Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen loader
The innovation begins to be seen in Europe, particularly thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded by Hyinda and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published in the Hanover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai provides a millennial model of a car for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market the fuel cell truck Hyundai continues Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models on the road as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this quality of the world's first project, we are taking fuel cell technology ever further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tanking network, Hyundai Motor's Vice-President In Cheol Lee said at the contract publication event.
The boxes stabbed several times in Kajaan
A little more than three - ten man abused three men in the restaurant in Kajaan’s center and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, resulting in his removal from the place.
Outside he pushed another man to the ground, and when a third man intervened in the situation, the offender still beat him.
The police caught the offender.
By the police station, the man still acted aggressively and kicked another policeman into his leg.
He also threatened the police by assault and killing.
He was taken to the prison to calm down.
The case is investigated as three abuses and as a violent opposition to a civil servant.
In Kajaan’s center, there was also a second case of abuse in Medikada on Saturday morning night.
Two men were abused by the victim.
First, a Kayan man about 20 years old hit the victim.
A little later another man threw him down to the ground and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the offenders away from the victim and they called the police.
But the offenders have been able to leave before the police arrive.
The police ask the eyewitnesses of the event to contact Kajaan police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail: onderzoek.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Erkki Pälli is dead on a long line radio runner
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio runner Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealed liver cancer on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, it's going on now.
The doctor has also said that I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation to the Iltalehti a month ago.
The security of the aunts and sons of trade must be guaranteed
For the first time, I got a pay in 1984.
When one thing gets surprised by these year-old rings, it's usually about the big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the safety of workers, I was astonished and even a little angry at times.
I also talked to the case by Erika Kähärä, an expert on the working environment of the Service Industry Association (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell you the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly serious and many of the real violence situations are not reported.
"Company is, of course, obliged to statistics on its situation in the vicinity on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain internally used and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Human injuries do not end up in the statistics.
In situations of violence, there has always been the problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Psychic traumas can nevertheless be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threat must be counted as violence, even if it is not the case.
Too many fears at their workplace, even though no actual action occurs.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got guards.
Even in the media, the liberalisation of the opening hours of the stores had a rather large impact on the safety of the sellers.
"Then quite a lot of employers arranged guard service at least nighttime hours and alone to prevent work," commented Köhär.
When nothing happens, you'll make the wrong conclusion.
This would seem to have been an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
As a result of security, when the disorders were well held, the idea was that security would be unnecessary.
In many places, we are now trying to find solutions to remove expensive guard services.
Slight abuse is a case-owner's crime, and it is quite understandable that an abused seller does not want to file an investigation request for a criminal who usually lives in a trade-related area.
But the same, according to the subparagraph of the 2011 law, slight abuse will become the prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused, the police should be investigated and the prosecutor charged.
When the court puts a few abusers in prison, and the judgment of the harsh end of the penalty scale from there, the habits would clean up.
A society where the food store must be open at small places about night and day must guarantee the safety of the workers of the trade.
Heidi Sohlberg made a call to Miss before the direct transmission started - "Sara, Iiro is married then"
Miss's crown this year is not seen in the traditional way on TV, but the broadcast shows the Viafree website.
The mission is run by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and host of Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studies, Iiro Harjula.
Backstagen and the red carpet runner are Janni Hussi.
Before direct transmission, the pilot triangle told the invited guests and media representatives who arrived.
First of all, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula an applause.
All the women are screaming!
Now, look at this man-runner, Sohlberg threw his fellow audience in a hurricane.
The races are followed by Miss Finland in many previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other and Sohlberg throwed a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro's married then!
Sohlberg blew to the Sari.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the just divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though at first looked confused.
She was talking about her divorce for the first time in the weekend of evening messengers.
Missikaunta said that she did not want to open the difference more closely in the public, because it was a matter between her and Roope Salmis.
He said he didn't have a hurry on a new relationship, but he's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own business and, in particular, I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
The marriage status of Harjula came up even later when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The runner triangle laughed at the mess.
Iiro was married, wasn't he?
Janni Hussi made a mistake.
The northern man tortured the bonded open mate by cutting, burning and feeding a strong sauce
The District Court of the Pohjois State has sentenced a 34-year-old man to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his spouse in Kokkola.
The crime tool included belts, cables and ties.
The court sentenced those items to the State as lost.
Rank's charges were against a suspect of gross rape.
However, the District Court rejected this charge.
Four abuses, brutal abuse, coercion, illegal threat, liberation, liberation, and two injuries were recorded as the cause of the coccoline.
The crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May last.
At the end of the last deeds, the man was captured and captured a few days later.
On Thursday last week, the District Court of the Nordic Islands issued its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two gross liberation abuses and the brutal rape of 22 May.
However, these charges were rejected by the court as inaccurate.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the court judge gave a public record of the judgment.
According to the court judge, the accused had targeted violence, threats and coercion against his spouse in situations where it had been bound.
The accused cut off his victim with a knife, burned with a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
With his judgment, the court ordered the state to have lost criminal instruments: belt and cable, buckets, bath belt, knife and toilet.
Four Witnesses
According to the Court of Justice, the parties continued their common life between actions.
It is readable from the trial panel that a large part of the most brutal acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The victim, 34 years old, must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering and temporary damage in total EUR 5800.
He hardly has that money, because he already has debts in his old life.
The prison sentence is not the first man.
The Nighttalehti won't tell a convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
The new court judgment is not lawful when it is written.
Europe in the lead of four points for the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals held their leadership in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup in Paris at 10-6 points, while on Sunday there will be twelve double games.
Europe won three of the four four games started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-game wins were set 2-2.
The leaders of Europe were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had been involved.
On Sunday, two people are looking for more history.
No European player has won five points together at Ryder Cup, and no one of the Americans has been able to hit like three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the brutal disruption of its supporters in the Honka fight: "Violence is not part of football"
The football game team HJK published a press release on Sunday, condemning the disorder of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We regret the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," says the press release.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters ran into the field and some seemed to try to challenge the dispute with Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers did not make the situation calm down, but they needed police and also horsemen.
HJK reports that the team's players and staff are shocked by the events.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old company.
"We are firmly dissolving all the activities that jeopardise the security of the event," says the press release.
HJK promises to assist the authorities and organizers of the event in identifying and eliminating factors that threaten safety.
The supporter culture is a part of football and an important thing for HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyful and encouraging action in football view.
" Violence does not belong to it," says the press release.
The Philippine inventor is flying with a drone car, avoiding traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a Philippines inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing crowd in the world who swears to have invented a flying car... or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dream.
He started the development of his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight... he flagged his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope the device will generate positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Work fights starting tomorrow will be visible in day care and social and health services for children
In the public and well-being sectors, over-work and shift bans will begin tomorrow, particularly in social and health services, as well as in day care for children, JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine evaluates.
The impact will be large and will certainly be seen in such a way that there is not enough personnel on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how to apply for their children.
The employer's task is now to ensure that services play and no life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, there was also a shortage of workers at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in over-work and exchange bans due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, for staff not to be hired, but for workers to remain overtime or to change their shifts.
This isn't a work fight yet.
It is a matter of safety at work that, for every employee, we should take care of and only do regular working hours.
The JHL is opposed to the government's intentions to reduce the protection of small businesses' dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, Director of the labour market of local employers, does not begin to assess in advance the impact of over-work and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very variable, although services may weaken.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what is to be done.
The region is so extensive, social and health measures and a technical sector that is so difficult to say.
The impact may vary very much by industry, region and employer, said Jalonen to STT.
Edelone says that last week, there was already experience, among other things, of the similar three-day activities of the Super and the Social and Health Association of Tehy.
Their effects were fairly low.
JHL's ban on over-work and shifts applies, among other things, to workers in the social and health sectors of municipalities, the church, the state and the private sector.
For example, family day caregivers are limited to the outside.
At this stage, the labour fight concerns almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's action may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other labour fighting activities if the law on redundancies continues to be prepared.
The government should now admit that it runs to the wall and hard.
Mr. Jalos believes that both the Ay and the government must come up.
It's special that the hard ones are already on the pier, even though the show has not yet been given, Jalonen is updating.
The Great Coral Rice is born in the gymnastics of children and adults, studying the creatures of the outer and seaweed.
In other premises, the Collective Great Coral Ridge received its first night in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kannelhus.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Rice is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the audience.
This time, however, a more clearly defined presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
In the theater game, too, there is plenty of magic for children.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
Still, the Great Coral Rice is not a child show, but a show that adults and children are doing in cooperation.
It gives adults information and observations about how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint games also removes the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Rice is a little similar to the satubalet, the gymnastics and the natural subjects of consciousness, but forever it is enticed in other, non-human conditions around visitors.
The Great Coral Ridge begins with acquaintance with the business paths of coral and coral animals and fish.
In six different sports districts, among other things, the teaching of the species of eagles and seaweeds.
Finally, a presentation of less than an hour will be made, where music, lights, shiny paints and suits will help to learn the life of the coral rivet.
There are both diving people in the Great Coral River who observe the life of the Coral River and the corals that are being considered.
In addition, there are bodies that look at coralls.
Views and observations in many directions make the presentation dense and life disturbing.
Whether it's the scenery of a body, the scenery of a body, and the other body or landscape of a body, and all of this at the same time.
It doesn't seem difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group is seeking to train towards the limit of thinking and activity, which is challenging to catch when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a quiet demonstration will be held at Sitrator for the threatened corals.
Disasters beyond human understanding should not be allowed to be harsh, even if it could be difficult to understand the importance of exercising self - compassion in the face of the prospects of disastrousness.
In other spaces, it has built its work so that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are also other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations, whose wondering and playing it furious space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood had no smartphones.
Today’s children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking as young and young as a whole.
I think children should be children all their childhood, and they should not interfere with their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they're doing that.
I was shocked when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth-class sister at the "boyfriend" weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I could not imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs must not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children would be able to live a decent childhood, and they would not have to grow up too early because of the group pressures created by friends.
I constantly see younger and younger girls in Instagram, who are pictures of makeup on their face and reveal clothes on their faces.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that are revealing at night.
It's harder for girls to figure out what age they're.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18 and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the forest and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones in my childhood.
I was allowed to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others thought about me.
General: The authorities have told the Head of State that the Airisto Helmi case is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, the protection police and the defence forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Government has been told that the Airiston Helme investigation is not currently linked to national security but to organised crime, Yle news.
The information of the anonymous sources was confirmed by the Chairman of the Committee on Defence, Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and the protection police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered to be economic crime.
They were quite tight about not speculating that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented in Yle's interview.
According to Yle's information, there has been no evidence of connection to national security from confiscated material, but the investigation is only in progress.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of the interviewers of Yle.
A week ago, large searches on Turku islands and continents have raised the question whether the investigation involves just economic crime or a threat to internal security in Finland.
Earlier this week, the evening made a case with claims both on behalf and against them.
Video: Dreams saved a series lost by Liverpool
Liverpool's 100 percent start of the Valioliiga ended, but it was still more satisfied with the team 1-1 on the Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be just a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and fled to 1-0 guest win.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent the whole Valioliga signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived at the same time the ideal in Western London.
The Reds had started the Valioliiga with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate alone after his own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league win on Wednesday from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to resolve the fight with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved immediately from the beginning of the month.
In 25 minutes, he first boiled in a small condition with the three-pounder Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the croate saw Hazard fall forward and sent him a fully weighted feed.
Hazard drove a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed a perfect left leg from there in the rear corner of the bet.
Pool's brass guard Alisson was a little slow to resist and got his fingerhead in the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss position slightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's control line.
During the second period, the Chelsea Veskari Kepa also made real efforts.
The Basque Guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the root of the trumpet into a corner shot.
On the other hand, Alisson relieved his throwing through Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firminon in his focus.
However, the Brass star’s pussy was directed towards a teammate David Luiz, who saved the master’s leadership.
It didn't last for the 89th minute, either, when the changeman Daniel Sturridge got free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in the top corner of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 game, but it's still on the league tip, together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the master window with two points behind the top.
In the watch transfer debate, the potteries are deep
I remember a decade ago, when a magazine asked different Finnish influencers, which divides the people of Finland.
Juice Lessons' answer was the only one to remember: the Nen end.
Some of their surnames have a nasal end and some don't.
I mean, you know, some sort of division lines can be born anywhere, and there's one of them.
Finland has made it possible in the EU to abandon the annual clock transfer.
Many agree that two times a year the movement of watches has been a job for fools and has caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing is now to decide what time we end up at: the current summer or winter time or any other time zone.
This also allows the people to say their opinion on the Otastatu.fi page.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open for Friday, 12 October.
The debate will be intense at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has his or her words to say.
Winter time defenders justify their position with the effect of morning light on human well - being and summer time defending evenings with the influence of outdoor desire and thus well - being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good reasoning.
Studies also show that morning light rhythms human day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if not particularly affected by the wake-up in the dark, the light will increase the movement of people outside and give better opportunities for, for example, autumn gardening.
The number of additional lights after the normal working day has already been calculated for their hours.
I'd prefer to take both, but badly we're in the northern corner of the Earth, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
A typical discussion on this issue is that one's own view is driven and one's view is strongly opposed.
The reasoning of the counterpart is not exactly listened because the most important thing is how it feels.
Since almost everyone finds an opinion on this, it is somewhat useless to try to turn another’s head.
There's a piece of screw burning to waste.
The subject is awful easy to discuss, because it does not require a great deal of seizure and reasoning is enough for a mood.
The same kind of things are generally argued more strongly and as fertilely.
It's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but it doesn't fit.
And always it also offers a suitable sinful beak if life feels like a monkey.
Josba fought the bucket's visitor victory
Josba's first guest game at the Salibandy Divor produced the full three serial points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left the Wall River for a happy 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
In the beginning of the third round, Grasmo was still the leader of the painting, but Josba applied for compositions and revolved men in chains.
In time, 50.47 brothers Edu and Juuso Lehtiniemi were running a 6-5-game.
The two teams were playing decisive minutes in the equation.
Josban was the most effective of Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fire-powered anyway when Teemu Ashkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
At the time of birth, Miika Kosonenkin (1+0) also played in the second chain.
After three series rounds, Josballa has six points.
The next is the O2-Jyväskylä visitor in two weeks.
Uncle's church Sunday, 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Uncle's church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday, partly in very sad atmospheres.
A week ago, the burning of the church of danger was a shock.
The Uncle's church was guarded in the two nights after the fire.
Even though it's painful today, there's still a party place.
Although no one would like that, the church of Eno is now the oldest church of the congregation of Joensuu.
The church in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite the communal and other connections of all the world.
The family starts in the Eno church today at 10:00.
Afterwards, we move to the congregation house at the livestock table.
There's all kinds of things in the program for a day, both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be acquainted with Ari Räsäse, who has retired for 37 years as a congregation master.
The church’s birthday celebration also means the end of one era.
Already removed, the congregation house built in 1982 keeps its door open today for the last time.
Now we're in shelters at the former municipal house, says Markku Koistinen.
The church house destroyed internal air problems, but the church has been in a healthy position for that 200 years.
Elon Musk takes away the Tesla government's speech, and the charges for fraud were agreed for $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and Elon Musk, CEO of the company, have agreed on their case with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority SEC.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of treason, and Musk was at risk of being abandoned because of the company he was founded.
However, Musk may continue to be the CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to leave the seat of the President of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will have to hire the president of the external government.
Musk is also subject to stricter supervision.
According to the agreement, Teslan must hire two independent leaders and will continue to monitor Musk communication more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay both $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and the disadvantages for Tesla's shareholders," says Steven Peik, Director of the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The Twitt instantly raised the Tesla stock price.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of treason.
According to the Agency, the dispute was false and misleading and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential sponsors of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that he would challenge the company and Muski's court.
The SEC said it would require Musk to be sentenced to fines and to be banned from operating in the management of stock exchange companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went to a strong decline.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian rush and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, reports the country’s disaster agency, according to the AFP news office.
The number of deaths is believed to grow, because the destruction is under way.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
Friday’s earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
The tsunami was given immediately after the storm, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least so far from Return.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area located in the centre of the gorge of Donggala, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, many people are known to have died.
Practical requests for assistance
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived today in the destroying area, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work without being tired of day and night.
One of the centers of the rescue is the hotel in Palau, whose ruins are still believed to be 50-60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Rescue Agency, told me that one person was taken alive at night from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel popular by business tourists.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to Syaug, heavy demolition equipment would be needed quickly for the shrinking and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their lost loved ones.
Help me, you in the back and around.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer made a bet in the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of disruptors in Britain
Many British politicians were being disrupted when their contact information was published due to the deficiencies in the encryption of the application.
The disruptors had access to, among other things, ministerial telephone numbers.
This was the application used by the British Conservative Party in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Development, and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, were subject to harassment.
Several MEPs received alarm calls.
As a result of the application's lack of encryption, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians in the mobile application of the annual Conservative Party meeting.
The public accessed the profiles by using the politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
The person who was registered in the profile looked at and edited the material recorded in the profile.
Somebody managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to the media mogul Rupert Murdoch image.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to log in to the profiles of other people on their e-mail addresses.
Then the login may view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in his name.
The meeting application made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party's reporter asked me to apologize for the leakage of information.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application now works safely.
The UK Information Authority ICO supported the leakage of data.
The application was prepared by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticizes the lack of confidence in the Conservative Party in security matters.
The Wall Finland tour audience has a large number of killing Polish people every week
Watch-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland.
The U.S. format, which was rapidly spread in the world, was used as a Finnish version to Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasose is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are performed.
In the Polish studio, the description possibilities were exceptional, because the size of the large 12 meters high gaming wall required space from the space.
During the start-up period, the social media raised the studio audience of the programme, which was beaten to be Polish.
On Twitter, you'll have a discussion about whether the Polish people may be sitting in the studio on the game to be played in Finnish.
Head of the Nine National Programmes Unne Sormunen will illustrate this to the Iltalehti.
He tells us that there are very close players in the studio audience, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as just Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international killers in Finnish production, just as the audience of the The Wall episodes described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such crowds, so-called professional audiences, who visit the descriptions of the different programs, Ringunen backgrounds.
He reminds me that following the game in itself is not so difficult to understand, even if it does not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are interpreters in the foreign language studio who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as a simultaneous interpretation to the studio director.
And the studio director then guides the audience and tells you how to go there, for example, and what's going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way in which David Hasselhoff was previously involved in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff took part in Talent Finland's descriptions a few years ago in Finland.
He always got a simultaneous insinuation in his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of the Ring.
The sub-Japanese sky is moving towards the main island - the authorities are warning of the landslides and floods
The authorities will also warn against possible floods and waves.
In Taifuun Tram, at least 50 people have been injured, but according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and there is no information on the deaths.
On the southern Okinawa island, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK radio company, people have been evacuated into shelters and electricity has been broken down by more than 300,000 households.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are in place to stop because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka at the time of Finland for half a day.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there is also a promise of heavy wind and rain.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to meteorologists, Trami's been pissing Japan until Monday.
Heavens I'm still darkening
It's been bad in the early days.
Heaven already darkened as almost a spark when the team lost on Saturday in his field of residence, reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, and a total of two points for six rounds.
No defender or two lower chain players have yet to paint.
The pressures also increase all the time.
Against sport, the audience was already in control at a time when the game was almost half left.
Six games are only played and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be worried, because that's what we played weakly.
Especially the second batch show was ashamed as bad, Jarno Kärki told Ass’s power 1+2.
For sport, the victory naturally tasted.
The team had a game below on Friday, so it would have been visible in making it.
It may have been seen, but Assat didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
Mother of the day of bread Pirkko Gutrinen wonders the audience of the event at the large hall view.
Somehow, it thought that maybe this year would not be so many people, Hyvärinen would think in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the SM competitions in Traktoriknön were held at the same time as the Toaster Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of people could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were steeply blocked before the decade, the sellers reported that the products had ended, the news break was sold more than 500 doses, and the number of cars was also heard by Gutrinen.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen will tell us later in the afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon, there was a particularly large amount of program for children’s families, which might have attracted them to a great deal of record.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sellers also go to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year,  rapporteurs, craftsmen, bakers and harvesters had arrived at almost 100 breadkeepers.
The mother of the day of bread PIrkko Gutrinen admired the audience of the room.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children's bread competition arrived in 11 different forms of bread.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the roast bread competition, spent a day in the pie of martyrs.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you recognize the good lamp
Wake up the space, create the right atmosphere for decoration and read the book without tired eyes.
It's worth a bet for good lighting.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
Tips gave Innolux's sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do your eyes a favor
The importance of lighting increases, the more age years are behind.
Adequate light can help many with problems of age when vision is decreasing and more and more blurred.
Parents also need to increase the need for light.
The sixties need light three times more than the twenty-two.
The effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp are therefore worthwhile for health reasons.
Good lighting would give you enough light, but it doesn't shine, Jokiniemi clue.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior is only accessible with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator can afford to choose for this moment.
The popular Japanese style combines inhabited, scandalous and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrostyle inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colours, metal tones or ice colours, has risen to a boom.
The intention is fascinating in the same way as in the other interior of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more money is being invested in home than before, and decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, one wants a customized, courageous light that has a story to tell.
People clearly apply for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So we're very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
Not necessarily the latest trendy one, but a timeless classic for which has been saved for many years.
Some kinds of thoughtless, embroidered and elegant classics keep their surfaces year by year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
CooKo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads will be separated.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three Liga matches with no power points in orange, KooKoo reports in its press release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooh in August with a one-year agreement, including a trial period lasting at the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played in KHL on Kunlund Red Star's lines and in KHL's farm in VHL's KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no information yet about O'Donnell's new company.
The player wants to show an example of recycling - the goods go to the world in the recycling boxes, the plastic switched to paper
The special game shop The player is now recycling not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the retailers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycling material.
For example, the products ordered from the net trade are packed in packages from importers.
All our packages will be re-used.
We may use boxes ten times, as long as the package is in order for it to be used, Ville Puurula Oulu Playman tells us.
As softening material, the company usually uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
Bubble plastics are avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are supposed to move into recycling material in the envelope.
The business wants to show others an example.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
It will also have financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is used again.
Recyclement is naturally suited to the Game Man's activities, as, in addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes the games and equipment used.
Each fashion-conscious acquisition: One and the same shirt works in every costume
The classical clothes work in different costumes from the season.
They create the foundation of a good wardrobe in multi-purpose, as it is easy to gather different costumes around high-quality classics even cheaply.
In autumn, the most popular classics in the wardrobe are high quality needles.
This category also includes black poolo.
A black needle made of natural material with pools cannot have an error purchase.
The clothing can be combined with both straight trousers, stylish shirts and jeans, and around it can create both a sturdy ensemble and a sparkling style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classically sophisticated style artist.
I saw you create the style.
The trendilook of the autumn comes from golden brown and wide-seamette pants, black pooloneule and grey angels.
The classic pooloneule together with other classics, the blue green coat and the red lobsters, form a feminine and refined ensemble of living.
This black pooloneule combines it with trendy clothes: jeans, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence sabotase activities have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotase activities.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelna group: sabotase and intelligence group.
In the west of the KGB, the Soviet Security Service's agents are preparing detailed plans for important sabotace sites, reports Vasili Mitroh, the archive manager in the west of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early the 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB purchased uniforms and clothing for cover operations for DRG Groups of the Bundeswehr, railways, yard guards and certain persons.
This trick was used by Russian scooter warriors in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed themselves with local Ukrainian police melting equipment, set up inspection stations from the Ukrainian peninsula for you and isolated their country of origin.
The agents of the Cold War hid sabotase groups in the land with supplies of mines, explosives, lighters and communication equipment.
In 1998 the KGB's shelter was found in Switzerland, which was exploded by the explosion of the fireplace when the authorities injected it with water guns.
The police reached four drunken drivers at night in the province
The police caught four drunken drivers across North Karelia on Friday-Saturday night.
In River Sue, a 18-year-old man in the container was blown at 1.57 percent.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaanis at half four at night.
With the danger of the Polvijärvi's scalp, the car broke off at four night, and the 19-year-old local man in the car alone, according to the police, blowed 1.54 promilles.
He didn't get any serious injuries on his way out.
A 20-year-old foreigner who was driving a passenger car in the outskirts center was blowing an embroidery of 1.33 promilles.
The police doubt these men's drivers about the severe drunkenness of the vehicle and the driver of Polvijärvi in addition to the danger of road safety.
On Saturday morning, at Tuup danger, a 36-year-old man transported a local van at the crossing of the Oil and Hokantien roads blowed 0.52 permille.
He's suspected of driving drunk.
The police are asking for observations of the stab at the Turku railway station after midnight.
According to the police, the man was abused at the parking lot in front of the station with the most life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded in the security camera.
The dark hair suspects dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jackets immediately after the stab was taken off by a dark farmer car with a tram line in the direction of the bus station.
One of the suspects left Humaliston Street in the middle of the city with a bicycle.
The pedestrian died after freezing under a bus in Por
In the porch, the pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after the bus hit him.
The accident occurred after 4 mornings in Raumantia at the Height.
The driver of the bus isn't suspected of a crime.
The police are investigating events leading to an accident.
HPK keeps Risk in its lines for the rest of the period, Journal's trial time ended
Mika Toivola, the sports director of HPK in Hämeenlinnan, says that Filip Riska (Centre) has been important for the team in the start-ups, underpower plays and in the defensive role of the fourth field.
In the early autumn, Filip Risk continued in Hämeenlinnan's HPK for the rest of the period.
The success of experimental risk, 33, in the roles offered to him, convinced the company.
Filip has been an important part of our starts, in subpower play and in the defensive role of the quadruple.
Although there is still some improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such a experienced player, Mika Toivola, HPK Sports Director, commented in the company's newsletter.
Hopefully, the value of the risk will rise when playing the Liga solution games.
A central attacker from the island of St. Petersburg Riska has previously played a league in JYP, Lock and Sport.
Instead, the attacker Oskari Lehtinen left without a contract after the trial period.
True story today on TV: The climber was left to death twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
The movie of the evening was made on the basis of them.
Everest now gets his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
The 2015 governance of Baltasar Kormákur relates to the survival struggle that has been dealt with by cereals.
The tragedy has been made of movies and documents, even before.
True events are also being examined in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the tours: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
That's exactly Hall who was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could have saved the eye surgery that was carried out before he left Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure on the air, he lost his vision, so the victory of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and didn't return again.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had just begun.
When the storm got up, he lost his mind and never found him back to the camp.
When a man was found, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed in survival.
Weathers was left to death.
But as a miracle, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The badly recovered Weathers was thought to be still dying, and once again he was left in his own happiness.
It's clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the climbers also began to believe in the possibility of providing him with help.
In the film Beck Weathers, Josh Brolin is presenting him.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we have celebrated the 200-year-old Eno Church.
The Uno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church hill.
The church was dedicated on 4 October 1818, and the whole family was prepared to celebrate Sundays.
The party began at the Eno church hill at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which there was an antiquity for the livestock table at the Eno congregation house.
The church was full.
The family attended 517 people.
Uncle’s Church Lord Armi Iron Mountain was happy that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, the Iron Mountain (in the picture) says.
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Hazards, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The Uncle’s Church is now the oldest church in the Gospel Lutheran congregations after the destruction of the Church’s Warfare in the fire.
The wooden church of the danger was completed in 1770.
In the morning, an excitement was held, where the church was silenced and remembered in fire.
Pictures and videos: The doctor blew his power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
The powerful hurricane type of September storm rolled from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicine, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Aeroscience Institute has given a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnesus, Joonian Islands, Cyprus and Greece.
There are plenty of floods across Greece in the pictures taken from the area.
The video published in Twitter shows how between the houses in the city of Kyoto, Korinthia, suddenly the river has appeared instead of the street because of the floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by the floods.
In the south of the Peloponnesus peninsula, heavy wind caused strong seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens guides people on their Facebook pages to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The mission calls for monitoring weather information and local authorities' guidelines.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicine, brings heavy rain and even flood dangers.
According to CNN, a 2011 published study suggests that medicines occur only once or two years around the world, typically on the roads of September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
Now the blazing storm left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing to travel north and towards Europe.
Concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in islands, such as Lesbokse.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In summer, the areas destroyed by fires will also be covered by the storm in the Athens environment.
In Greece, my medicine also fell in November last year.
Now you don't have to go to the sea, you're still flying in your schedule... on the Greek islands threatened by the storm of the September, you're hiking thousands of Finns.
The seaside trips are cancelled and walking should be careful not to fly into the storm.
Such guidance has been distributed to fairly 3,500 Finnish guides in Greece for holidays on sun trips in Finland this weekend.
The instructions will come to need, because even the zorbas storm that rises to the hirmuleum has been predicted to pierce the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the Crete Island, wind speed can rise up to 45 meters in seconds.
It's the heavy rains that increase fidelity.
All travellers from Greece through Sun trips and Tuin who have indicated their telephone number have been warned by the travellers by SMS.
Still in the air sun and heat
According to Inka Ikose, by the beginning of the Saturday evening, the sun trip communication expert has been avoided from the worst.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course we're monitoring the situation all the time.
Security ahead of us.
I supported media advocator Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also gone on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff at the target.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early night on Saturday.
The most popular islands in Greece, Rodox and Crete, currently have a total of fair 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred travellers spend their holidays in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island will reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodox had sparked the sun and the temperature had been painful to 27 degrees, says Icon of the Sun.
Zorbaksen has been estimated to be the next turkian giant, though a little lessened.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and, for example, we have checked the number of Finns flying in Antalya Tu, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvise and Janni Huss are completely identical evening dresses in the Missifinal, so they react to the situation.
Mediapersona and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open evening dress.
She says she's got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust professionals who found me a very beautiful suit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by Shirly Karvinen.
The twin himself also noticed his similar clothing and looked at the situation laughing.
Karvinen told the evening-Sanom that he was in a hurry in preparation, and he was forced to set up on the plane.
The cock is working in the Missifinal as a backstage and red carpet drinker, and he talks about the most prominent stars.
Huss has a fresh move behind, because he moved from Kamp to Jösses Island on Friday.
So far, I'm gonna stay there. Let's see what's going on.
It's important that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before she moved, Hussi was on her own holiday in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was just a week in a hotel without leaving anywhere.
When the stress came out, I got a flu, but otherwise vacation was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention to collecting the curious views of retired people.
Runner and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told me on Miss Suomi's red mat he had enough to do with radio runs and Love Island Finland.
There has been enough hurry even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from Finnair's flight.
I made it up and put the hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
The change of dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen tells me he pulled his makeup out in the middle of the retired.
His preparation also raised the attention of the passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for others.
Hair is flying to Spain once a week.
In Marbella he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells me he enjoyed his pestish Love Island as a runner of Finland.
He also describes his experience that has been stopped so far.
Karvinen tells me he's been on the show on Friday.
It's really rough in some way.
It's human real emotions, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program's singles.
How do I wear over-generation boots?
Three Perfect Exemplary Dresses
Classical clothes are clothing pieces that operate from season to season in other clothing than in clothing.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes there are even more modern individuals.
A few years ago, the overgeneration hubs that rose as a hitting engine for the September and Winter season have not left anywhere.
According to their name, the boots above the knee repeat in style from year to season.
Looking boots share users’ views, but a brave model is worth trying, well - bravely.
Because, in fact, the supergeneration boots are suitable for any housing.
It is then about jeans, pits, nice or tricose, the sleeve skin or artificial leather surface works.
Long boots look good, both in the party linen and in the regular socks.
Black overgeneration boots are also very suitable for damaging housings.
They appropriately balance the femininity of the pink, the flower’s flea sleeve and the muddy needle.
It's a rigorous, but it's a bright, bright and romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retrospective body of living comes from a long, copper-brown roast, high-generated, visible earrings and a nit little bag.
Although there is a certain degree of refinement in over-generation boots, they are also perfectly suited to a relaxing daily mouth together with a t-shirt, long shorts and trendy flag.
Lovely easy and still so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They were operating for the rest of the year and taking a ride to passengers, Espoo City informs.
Takeniemi robot cars operate in the bus simulator's role, as the next spring in the area is intended to start traffic with a robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot robot vehicle transport throughout the year and test the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robot cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says the traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars are completely automatic in other traffic without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their environment with several different sensors and assessing whether the road is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says the CEO of Sensible 4 responsible for robot traffic development Harri Santamala.
Robot cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesday at 13-15.30, Wednesday at 10-15 and Thursday at 10-15.
Robot cars stop by six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops to identify the stop markings.
It's safer to get in from the station number one on Otakaare.
The mokoma group's base fell down from the stage during the gig and got hurt
The Mokoma group will inform on its Facebook page of the surprising situation at the Tampere Packroom event.
The Mokoma Group's work at the Tampere Packroom got a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band was founded by Santu Spencer fell off the stage during the appearance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
The spider's wrist broke.
The band will inform on its Facebook pages.
"We're breathing!"
Last night, the Sanguy tripped in the Packroom on the stage in the last song and broke his wrists.
Let's hope for a quick healing for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour is done with extra crew, says on the page.
The mokoma fans answer with concern to the photo update where the basti-Santtu lies a gypsum in the hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was quite worrying about how bad things happened.
The relief is great. Fortunately, the bones improve over time.
Tsemppi and quick recovery for Santu and a good tour for the other band plus the winner!
And thank you for yesterday, the great gig was, but you promise to continue to leave such a strong drama from the end of the gigs? write a fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Carolina and Savo
On Friday and Saturday, the Finnish Police Department conducted hunting surveillance with the Forest Government and Finland's Reb Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savoa, the police department's staff reported in social media on Saturday.
The main focus of monitoring was on the legality and permission of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected by a hunting card and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, the holding permits for hunting weapons and the permissible number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used for canal identification were verified.
According to the police, during the inspection, 112 hunters were inspected and only one hunter was encountered during the inspection without the required hunting permit.
12 daily fines were imposed on the hunter for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, the police blowed 133 drivers of vehicles, and two of them are suspected of driving drunk.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine procedure, once by the police.
In summary, the hunters are very well following the permissibility of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter found that "I've hunted in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
East Finland's police department will continue hunting surveillance in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The silent moves to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quotas refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been taken to Finland.
Choices are usually made a couple of times a year and include representatives from the Immigration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Industry and the police.
The delegation is already holding interviews in Turkey.
The UN refugee organisation UNHCR will first select people with a particularly vulnerable status.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in refugee camps in a particularly distressed position, such as single-care families, disabled and sick, women and children.
There are more people in the group coming to Finland than in the quota, because practically some of them are not here for different reasons.
On its way, the Turkish Minister for the Interior, Mr Soylu, and the Syrian border are also non-governmental organisations.
The trip is also accompanied by Head of Office of the Ministry of the Interior, Ilkka Salmi.
Extending the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota for a few years was 1,050 in the year, but the government has not since reached an agreement to raise it.
The company has supported the increase of the quota, but the project has last fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) recently introduced a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
This is the first visit by the Minister of the Interior to follow the choice of quota refugees during this reign.
The former ministers of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) had the opportunity to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10,000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the beaten people. I don't know if they're crying or laughing anymore.
Last Saturday, a karian had news about a bill to amend the animal welfare law.
The article had the view that the draft law, in principle, prohibits the holding of animals as production animals, pets or other business activities which are not specifically permitted by the regulations of the ministries.
In other words, everything else is basically prohibited except the animals specified separately in the Regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it means that we are rejecting in Western democracy the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that jeopardise the security of society or good practice.
Now, in principle, we are about to regulate the prohibition of any activity to which the law or regulation does not specifically authorise.
This change results in the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business and nothing else until the adoption of the approved law or regulation.
The government's work in lawmaking has generally been weak.
If we go on the road now that basically in Finland everything that is not allowed separately is prohibited, we no longer know whether we are crying or laughing.
I don't doubt whether the animal welfare law would require an update.
But the legal project in this direction does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder whether it can accept such a "all that is not permitted by law or regulation" procedure.
I hope there will be a reasonable minister who will stop the progress of such a legal project.
Metti Forssell tip: Autumn four trendiest skirts

Turkey is urged to download mobile phones in case of a storm
The Zorba storm in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned especially the seafarers, fishermen and farmers in the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
On Saturday’s early night, disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that internet access is functioning so that people can get up to date updates, reports Anadolu Time.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from windows and, for example, to move garden furniture out of the wind.
Turkey is expected to have a heavy rainfall and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 metres in seconds.
in Greece red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Aeroscience Service gave a red weather warning to the regions of the South Greece of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cypriots and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies in Greece warned the Finns of the Zorba storm in Greece.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens also published a storm warning.
Travellers were invited to follow weather information and local authorities' instructions.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, there was a lot of wind and rain.
People were completely peaceful, the head of communication Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told the STT on Saturday.
The wavetonen described the situation as the same on Saturday night.
By the end of the day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from the Finns in distress.
In Greece, ships in several ports did not operate on Saturday, said the local news office Amna.
The boats to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, told the STT of travel agents.
According to the Finnish Athens delegation, temporary disturbances in air and ship transport were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather is being monitored actively.
Kimi Räikkönen cast the reason for Mercedes' better than Ferrar.
Ferrarin Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard in Russian gp times.
However, there is no reason for panic in the Ferrari camp to fall, the experienced driver assesses.
They were just faster than we, but there's nothing big about them.
Our car was the best in time all weekends, but they were just too fast, for the fourth time, and with their storemate Sebastian Vettel, who clearly remained from the Mercedes speed, said Räikkönen.
Ferrar had a hard time already in the previous race in Singapore.
He was asked why the sudden fall of Mercedes' ride was right.
Looks like they're going faster than we are, as simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go the same speed as they.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is an everlasting guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In times, rare tastes were seen for the future Sauber of Räikkösen.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrar in the next season, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also went to the last time session.
For Swedish drivers, the tenth place of departure is best for more than three years.
And even though at the second driving session five drivers left completely out, the outcome was still tasteful for Sauber.
And maybe encouraging the Rooky to think about what's going on?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been a big step.
Next year there's a different story, so let's see, let's see.
That's it, Robert Helenius drove Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper’s match in Stuttgart night progressed on a flat track.
The German was a more initiative party in the ring, but he did not get a real hit.
Clearly, more extensive Helenius controlled the fight with hard series that found well.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked Teper on the left straight.
The hit was so hard that the man who fought in front of the public did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was achieved, Helenius breathed quite moderately.
In an interview, he first praised the good atmosphere and opponent created by the audience.
Then he switched Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish incentives.
We were taken with the belt today.
Helenius was happy right after the match.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
Maybe there's even a chance to get to the MM match, Helenius commented on the Iltalehti before the match.
Instead, the kill might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it has come to mind.
Here's no more younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may increase
According to the Guardian magazine, the Vice President of the country urges to prepare for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Saviors are looking for the remaining people and also the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the hamlet city of return and its neighbours in Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Return, the situation in Donggala has not yet been clarified.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been hurt badly.
There are still people in decayed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa Hotel in Pala has been attacked.
Saviors tell that they have heard the cries of people who have been trapped from the ruins, but the lack of cleaning equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has commissioned the military for rescue and demolition.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster area electricity and communications are crossed in many places.
The fuel reserves are also being exhausted.
Miss Finland’s hesitant response and long reflection caused a laughter
Billnäs Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
A question was asked to each Missifinalist during the interview round.
The finalists pulled the question from the glass bowl on stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoske, 23, the hesitant answer was made in the audience present with sweet, but well - wanted laughs.
The question put to Anttikosk had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book that the Missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer before he began hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
The reflection was made in the audience at a time of laughing, until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is an economics person, Anttikoski answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a grim applause from the audience, with laughter.
Earlier on a Missile tour, Anttikoski drew attention, because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principles.
In 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00 a.m. when the crown will be abandoned by Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm last year.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes man popular, carismate or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who analysed the matter have described two kinds of "coolide" consisting of a little different features: a generally charming coolness and, in that respect, a contrasting dissident-coolite.
According to the description of scientists, charmingly cool people had many socially desirable features: they were outward, friendly, harmonious and qualified.
There was, again, a typical distance, independence, rebellion, and abundance.
They thirsted for experiences, and they only cared a little about external assessments.
Both types combined good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of hardness is not cool: high status in teenage doesn't necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what is reported by the US research published in the Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who were early dating, partying, searching for good - look pork and seeking the favor of others, had the increased risk of drug use and criminalization as young adults.
In their human relationships, they did less than they had before their unnoticed fellows.
High status messages from the reads of wolf cars, bags or watches do not make man cool - or at least really attractive company.
In the study published in the Social Psychology and Personality Science in August, most people were more willing to make friends with their ordinary market t-shirts than those dressed with their shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose a shirt on their shirt in the situation of acquaintance.
If you're on the Greek islands, be careful!
It's hitting a storm - the weather warning shouts red
During the weekend in southern Greece, water can be rained as much as in Finland during the average six months.
The Zorbas Storm strikes Greece during the weekend.
Make sure you stay in the area of Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cypriots or Crete.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Embassy of Athens will announce it on its Facebook pages.
According to the Greater Neighbourhood, the Greek air science service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The nearing storm is also reported in the Foreca blog.
According to it, the hardest trees in the storm are up to 45 meters in seconds.
Due to the comparison, Finland sparked from the beginning of the week the Kuisma storm blowed hardest at 31 meters in seconds.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rain.
The weekend in South Greece, there can be more than 300 mm of water.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared video on the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men's love Island Suomi Anku?

Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku by several men also appears on strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
In videos, Anku advises assees, among other things, to prepare the ink from the old economic paper chip.
Anku also shows his sympathic style how you can stack a silk that grows the right ticks.
Now we make the Easter grass grow, but do it a little surprisingly, Anku suggests and presents sausage, sock trousers and seeds of the raid that he makes silk.
Videos can be viewed below or from Anku Youtube channel here.
Mr. Battas was shaking and chewing adrenalin in Sotsh, is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas would tremble a little more than ten minutes after the Russian gp's roast-place drive when he was in front of the media.
A great round left behind Mercedes first Lewis Hamilton and was certainly spiritually important for the Finnish time that was gathered this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
It feels good, I'm still a little shaking, Boottas explained.
I've only been on fire once this year, in Austria (in the middle of the summer), so time has passed quite like that.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It's not easy to pass on the Sotsh track, so the departure is particularly important.
And of course, Bottas was allowed to answer the question whether he's going to win tomorrow or if he's ahead of the MM titles to approach Hamilton's jeesa.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the palate, there can be no other goal, Battas palated.
But as a record, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis's leadership Sebastian Vetel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so it keeps in mind.
Let's see what's going on, but Bottas complemented it.
After driving Hamilton was really happy with the success of Bottas, and Mercedes' stable boss, Toto Wolff, also tasted.
Lewis was going to win the Valtteri, but he couldn't make it in the row.
The Superintendent knows he needs to take everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so uploaded that adrenaline was chewing out from the ears, Wolff shook.
The question is whether the booth of Bottash and Hamilton will drive fairly, Wolff answered the argument.
We'll talk tomorrow morning, and see how the race is going.
Kiteal Erno Kinnunen achieved the Rall Finnish championship
The SM series of the Rally Cars ended rarely.
Hardly ever before the brothers have ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by the Tuusulate Erik and Henrik Peterinen in the Turu and Salo surroundings, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
The guitarist Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the decision competition sealed him from the SM4 category of the Finnish Championship.
Honda Civic, who competed with Kinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä, started the Turku sub-competition in Malta because the starting points were clear: investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twins had to give a scalp when some of the additional lights were deceived with another special test.
That's where I got a pretty blind one of the third ones.
I don't think that's what's going on in that situation.
On Saturday, only the second series was followed by Jussi Tepo, Kinnunen told.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said that foreign troops should leave Syria immediately and without any conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are fighting terrorism in Syria, and the war against terrorists is, according to him, "a close to over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Germany that there was plans for October to be a meeting with the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans looked at the Supreme Court's judgeship drama on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who were at the Supreme Court, were given an exceptional number of people.
On Thursday, at least 20 million people came to their televisions.
At that time, Kavanaugh, named by Donald Trump, and the California professor Blasey Ford accused of tribulation, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary results, the hearings followed a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to their online consultation, several millions more followed.
NBC reported that the live trim was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it had made its annual record with 8,2 million live broadcasts.
The number of CNN increases by more than 10 million, according to the number of followers through Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are channels' own, TV viewers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they are in any case dizzy.
Few go to 20 million.
In the U.S., more than 20 million viewers usually only have access to sports contests and the great Oscars and Grammy gaals in the entertainment world, as well as to occasional political events such as presidential speeches and in 2016 presidential protests.
Of course, the most yearly show in the United States, the NFL final match to Super Bowl is on its way.
This year, Super Bowl collected about 103 million people around the screens on the NBC channel.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump’s first talk to Congress looked at a total of about 48 million people and 30 million people who were employed.
Top-priority
The name of the Supreme Justice judge is an extremely important case in the United States, because the posts are lifelong.
Trump has already been able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans have managed to prevent President Barack Obama from appointing his successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several questions he was a so-called Waa'an language, whose voice could resolve the position of the nine-spirit court.
He was the advocate of abortion and sexual minorities' rights, and, for example, in 2015 with a vote, decided that the same sex had a marriage right in the entire federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His choice to the Supreme Court may lock the law for decades of conservative supreme power.
Children have the right to access their information to their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health data of their children from the Kanta Service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Initially, the situation of the Kanta Service was of course even more worrying: parents were unable to look at even the health data or recipes of children.
A temporary correction was made for persons under 10 years of age in autumn 2016.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has been surprisingly long to repair.
Now the correction is in place - in 2020.
As the problem is clear, the amendment of the legal basis should not have been more than a blatant matter.
Afterwards, the understanding of the valley is about pressing the button: now that the rod is stuck, open it.
Of course, the child can show his or her parents his information if he has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The identity card is paid, and you can't even get 10-year-old bank IDs.
So, in practice, the four-class information in the secondary school can only be seen by asking for it in print.
It is not so much about parents' right as about children's right.
For the care of the child, it is extremely important for parents to be involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy needs to be taken care of.
Even minors may have family situations where all things cannot be discussed freely.
Often they relate to sexual health, which is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the United States, the FBI started revoking the disruption charges against Kavanaugh.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI will investigate at least two women's charges of disruption.
One of the women was heard by the Senate Committee on Justice earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has challenged the charges relating to alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate Committee on Justice.
The investigation should not last a week.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation about a limited investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
The man threatened to kill police at a police station in Kajaan.
The rigged shrinker kept flushing with the barracks.
The police say they've put a man in a police prison to calm down.
The police were threatened by the suspect on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The authority informs of the case that began when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a rough dispute in the central courtyard.
The man first abused another client inside the food shop.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by putting him down.
When the third party tried to intervene, he still beat him.
Trinity assault led to a call from the police.
The patrol took the man and took Kajaan to the police station, says the police.
The suspect continued to be aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in his leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
The police say they've passed a man's prison to "slow down".
The man is suspected of three abuses and the violent opposition of a civil servant.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work in Indonesia's Sulawes - "The cleanest water is the most urgent"
UN Children's Organisation Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawes," reports Kirsi Haru, Head of Information of the Finnish Unicef.
Local authorities lead rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
In the return city of Sulawes, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala area, the situation is slightly northerly more unclear.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
Grant operations are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings are often light structured in Sulawes, so the destruction caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection in the first place, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First of all, people are most likely to be able to offer water cleansing pills, which Unicef also has in stock.
Water systems are intended to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency case, water is transported primarily by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
The search for family members and the integration of families is one part of Unicef's mission field.
Food aid is also organised, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected are used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF has already started a collection of money to help victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Milliarder Elon Musk stops as the President of the Tesla Government - $20 million fines for twins
Elon Musk, the founder of companies that manufacture space missiles and electric cars, avoids fraud charges in agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Milliarder Elon Musk will terminate his duties as Chairman of the Tesla Government and will accept a fine of $20 million.
Musk does not take part in an agreement with the U.S. Securities Supervisory Authority.
By choosing Musk avoids the charges of fraud.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk for treason because of the twists he sent in August.
Musk wrote that he was preparing the electric car company to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange, which made the company's stock price rise fast.
Under the agreement, Musk must not be President of the Government of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Teslan must appoint a new "independent member" in his government and take two "independent leaders" in his management group.
Teslan must also set up a committee to monitor the communication of Musk.
Musk will continue to be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to the personal fines of US$20 million, the Tesla company also has to pay the equivalent 20 million fines to the financial supervisor.
The tweets led investors to mislead
According to the SEC, Muski's Twitters misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the financing for the purchase of Tesla from the stock exchange as a private company.
According to the billionaire twits, the company would have been bought out from the stock market at the price of $420.
The Tesla stock price increased by more than 10 per cent in the day after the twists, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Muski's arguments had no basis.
According to the Supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the claim of funding.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with another management group or the government of the company.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14% when the Supervisor of Securities SEC reported fraud.
The new contract is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The final judgment is not a reason
Of course, the watches of the cricket don't ring when the wisers don't move.
It's a technical defect.
The tower of the church of Helsinki has stopped.
The wisers show you at 12:00.
The situation is like an average horror film: still when the church crypts were exorcised and the tributaries would be their own.
Of course, that is not the case, but the clock has stopped because of technical reasons: it is broken.
It has been seen by the repairer, but some part has broken and a new part is expected, Suntio Evelina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church of Helsinki-Twitter account.
In fact, the account mentions that the final judgment is not the reason for the clock stopping.
Jamsen tells me the church's watches aren't ringing because of the fault.
