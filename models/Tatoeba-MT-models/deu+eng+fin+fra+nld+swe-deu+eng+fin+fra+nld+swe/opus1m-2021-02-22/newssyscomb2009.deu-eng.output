Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
After the first preliminary results, a noticeable weakening of both parties to the major coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the precedented parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered losses, where the position of the former president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the table.
On the other hand, the Head of Election of the Alliance is prepared for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, for a triumph return to federal policy.
According to previous results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 per cent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 per cent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially for the People's Party who had requested the earlier elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advance before the SPÖ.
However, the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably open the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to the renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received provisionally 18 per cent, the BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed at the same time their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had reached a common government with the Populist agreements (the FPÖ was still uniform at that time, in 2005 split it from the BZÖ) which had even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is clearly relying on this development and is moving from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Greens' Party moved to Parliament, but suffered some minor losses and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party was likely able to cope with the 4% burden and, consequently, did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of the illegal collection of cages, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi, after the discussions, said that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted to join the local government in Darjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshi thinks it would be best if he were to appeal to a higher instance.
He could so ask for bail and wait for his judgment in freedom, according to the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed similar views during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he would be granted grace," said the chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian Minister pointed out.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he reiterated, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the commitment to deal with the matter, the Minister went away.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he merely stated.
A Czech heads over the ringing around the seabed
He arrives on an electronic card, which is located in Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also belongs to the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-headed staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
Here are working elan and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far been a few known world, which is rich in natural sources.
Here we can find oil, more ore and other raw materials that have not grown up, but also unknown living organisms that, for example, bear the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the shore states have vigorously declared their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN Convention, they use their right, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental schelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental schelf.
"Simply expressed as a continental schelf, the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface, is considered.
It exceeds the borders of the shore, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," says Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental schelf must be substantiated by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three latter countries have been successful," says Mikulka.
An international echo recently struck Australia's success, which was the first country to expand its sea areas significantly.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was approved last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
As they promise, the profit that will be flown to them from the use of the seabed in the future will have an inestimable value.
Other States will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do this for ten years from the time they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental schelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity".
Then there is no state in a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted to an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor is not a golden graveland," says Director Mikulka with some exaggeration and adds, "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block within the framework of the joint organisation "Interocean metal".
It was granted the status of a so-called "roadbreaking investor" in 1991, as well as the investors of some of the other states.
The organization has the right to promote ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"There you can transport on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of Rober Sandev's division brings such concreteness as a pattern.
It reminds us of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous scheme that has brought the legend to life after the Golems.
German special forces were on-site for hostage release
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
On the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are being known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action.
According to this, both specialists of the Federal Defence and officials of the GSG 9 were the flyer staffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Agency at the place of release.
However, as Ministerial spokespersons further informed on Monday evening, German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and flee when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to engage them as local support forces.
"Fortunately, it has not come to this," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged up and down.
The identity of hostages remained unclear until the last time as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The savied have now been well-preserved in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on details of release.
In Berlin, there was first no information when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" label, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be expelled with an airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representation House rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has scarcely failed the $700 billion heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went out into the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to curb the chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
Reasons were the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, fell again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the consent of both the House and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers see increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 per cent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic odds, the Germans' desire to travel remains unaffected in a study.
When bookings for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the market research institute GfK's investigation, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the sales surplus of travel agencies for October had been around 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRV informed.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates it for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the United States was particularly required, the DRV informed.
Here the booking increase amounts to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic gefilds among the Germans, are particularly requested destinations.
In particular, package trips would be high," said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "better predictable for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that revenues will be recovered from the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans traveling down compared to the previous year.
My first time October party
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer made of liters and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A meadow debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a customized Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: less than three minutes on the meadow, the photographers already fall on us and cut the memory cards full - very flattering and that at my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Wurst Quator, the well-being in the tragedy until then remained within limits.
But once you arrived on the Theresian Weaver, everything is half as bad.
Nearly everyone wears dirndl or leather trousers; no one looks resistant or embarrassingly touched - everything completely normal.
Strange views of the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndlshorse.
A Munich woman reminds me that I would have wrongly bound the shrub: "Lefts hoast free, middle virgin, forgiven right, whispered back."
Homely, I brittle the loops from back to left.
"Pass," said and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirt techniques and wear simple filts on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches against the naked back of an undisputed one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is Bob, who comes from England and also visits the October party for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-distance "oooooo".
That's what he tells me after he got rid of his previously drunk size.
Right next to one of these hydraulics, everyone thinks he's a trash.
So Bob's one of these infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others do not have the happiness of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
At 8:00 a.m. in the evening, medical practitioners run across the main square, which need to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the rod - always four at once drag a covered bearing of tent to tent.
This works like with most meadow visitors: empty, fully back.
You don't see who's in the promille box under the plane.
"These are those where goarnimmer pack," one of the nurses called me on request and disappeared in the drum.
Name of the victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after driving in Essex by a vehicle was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on the Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident due to the suspicion of light-minded driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits ritlings at the end of the train path with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German city hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is decaying about
But once you are inside the curved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the awesomeness of the project, whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a spearhead in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist intentions blurred during the first World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces withdrawn from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammo train flew into the air, and the artificial roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly broken down, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything to the east, to highlight the enlargement of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of convergence.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the core data of this new foreign policy, I entered the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading ACP foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on tracks that produced the equation of the old world in the famous documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new worldly state project, to turn the back of the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the ACP headquarters, a specially manufactured, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and bars in which medium managers in suits, both men and women, met to close the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Costume, cravate, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The cold war was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look at the east and the west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could at some point," I asked, "to be forced to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "was not going to have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke with here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, as the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can travel east towards Asia and the Middle East on the railroads.
Back to Hydarpasha's station, after another night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be too far in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at that time there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Dead" Handley (after calling on September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any musical piece presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and was the only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left behind for years.
How often death kept us "to let music speak for themselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never mastery but never superfluous.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader had to be beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he headed the Guildford Philharmonics.
Over the past 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two well-known horses in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship in 1950 ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Aside from Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which later was published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry".
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham finally and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black-white, documentary style.
They alerted me to them because of their simplicity and the power they broadcast, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda captures the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limousine offers a much larger one.
In addition, the technical blunts allow even more comfortable driving and petrol.
Changes ahead of the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasised.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz was released on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nonetheless, Honda is trying to increase the sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japan's company sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars. That is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold 8 000 jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model enables you to hide the sales cut in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
In spite of this sales growth, Honda increased its market share in Spain (1.6%) to 1.8% compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda focuses on the emergence of a new model.
This is an Insight hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, which Japan's company hopes to sell around 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to the Japanese producer's market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed over the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution which was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the suitcase, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres higher than the capacity of the first generation's suitcase.
It must be stressed that these measures are available on the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda jazz bag with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litre.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance while at the same time providing high torque performance for the entire engine running time.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6 000 torques with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS in the previous generation, he now manages to reach 100 PS.
The jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene' avoiding collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, more precisely by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight returns to bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the facet eye of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows her to fly in her personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the circular perspectives, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles located before the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and at a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a bordeigened microprocessor, which is translated directly into a signal to prevent the collision.
`In the moment when the obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels by 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this evasion manoeuvre is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot change upwards or downwards, but can't cover; it can only move on two dimensions and towards the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not into the infinite directions and in an infinite way as it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and brake functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs a couple of seconds to process the information and act according to these data.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres performed, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KBs of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage area.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years in the series cars predicted.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and hold longer as a variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the goal while driving and avoiding obstacles on the road.
She's shaking before she's loaded with a mortgage.
It must be understood that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the US citizens being involved in mortgage history of allegedly paymentable banks, a entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad credits' or the confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two and up to three times whether it is the time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably also the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes their capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to issue nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stock at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The price assumed is below 19% of the price value of the stock on 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be sold again at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be done on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 per cent above the current price value.
However, Morgan Stanley's share fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to a holding bank," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which should allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply explained that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
`A week ago', declared in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, `we thought that the participation would be entirely composed of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will proceed with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter is exchanged to more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance sheet had fallen `clearly' since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to watch how their stock exchange price fell half, while the price for insurance against insolvency accelerated.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only survivor of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly with Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refound the Republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third one who chose this Sunday, following the example of his equals and friends, the plan of a new constitution.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results of 80% of voters' votes, 64% agreed with 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% agreed with `No', 7% of the polls were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
For the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be obtained.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the election venues and a counting of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for `Yes' and prophesied to him 63% to 70%.
In the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The `Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean similar Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the Observatory of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text to secure 'new socialism', for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional Project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from oil promotion by foreign companies and from foreign exchanges that send the foreigners to the country.
The project, driven by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also gives the Head of State greater power, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates of each four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also proposes to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base as a base for American antidrogen operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and uncontaminated way this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they had been freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, at 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to the international airport of Cairo.
They were brought directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'was not paid a ransom', said Egyptian Minister for Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the roller field.
After being captured at a car safari at the foot of the Ouanat mountain in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya on 19 September, the group of hostages was repeatedly approached by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hide.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the special units, from boarding two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before dawn.
"On both sides shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said this responsible person who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian specialised units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is, about the role that the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units played.
‘We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the Secret Service and the Special Units’, he explained without further details.
He also contested that a ransom had been paid.
The previous night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle in a patrol where the kidnappers, of whom they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army stated that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately contested this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up and accuse the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are hungry?
Which politicians will dare remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and culturally important buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only makes 3.5 million euros available for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all parliamentarians and all government circles, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec's history societies, at least 40,000 honoraries, gathered in 211 history societies, strive to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watch dogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when sponsors and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments national parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux States want to bring the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which has fallen into turbulence due to the US financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the Bank may have precedent.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States buy the respective shares of the Bank at about 49 per cent.
The bank will probably sell part of its shares, above all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The Fortis shares started a steep valley tour last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios have already taken place.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too large for a plentiful.
The securities of the institution fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year rate.
Since years the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting insecurity on the markets is the fault of the Fortis shares valley journey.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find itself interested in a substantive offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fowls in the chicken stable
Because of the drug use of a person, life and health insurance often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer in America.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of drug data to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in an independent hand, otherwise we trust the flock the chickens" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the tracking of prescription data.
Insurance determines the fees and payments in the event of damage depending on the health of the customer, and if the risk is estimated too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical investigation and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the findings of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years by the pharmacies, tells us which preparations have been purchased, and the program calculates the disease of the customer and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-reducing drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatable, which would automatically rank him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurances only have to do the paperwork more, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraine and heat walls, but also depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the above mentioned are not.
For the survey and processing of the data, their own societies have formed which, before receiving the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although failures have not yet been obeyed.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and link them to the data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of the state of health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a separate data protection law on health data, its effect is limited to health care providers and insurance providers.
The bill has already been submitted to the Congress that the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned is hardly able to prohibit access to his data, since otherwise insurances do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are in some way left to the grace of the fox.
Global dining plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which discusses mainly cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given more voices and voices in international concerns, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit yesterday in Marseille.
The French President and the current EU President-in-Office Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diploma Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to more than EUR 100 billion.
Given that trade between 2000 and 2007, from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious at all.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will also be fledged in the future.
Until 2009, India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's partner number one, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, was strongly condemned by both sides, and the convening of a UN conference was also under way.
The Doha Round should also be completed, both sides being blamed for failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, i.e. to reducing pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
This also agreed with India, just as with the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the issue of the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
However, in Paris, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion are expected for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to Agency notifications, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
For the current event, the international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the trade fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour for the event.
Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities, will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the room structure will be followed in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: at this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign writers' books is decreasing in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sector.
Found the missing small plane of the billionaire Steve Fossett a year ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire missing on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was found.
The parts were found on a high plateau of 3000 m high, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely uncovered the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a crew was sent. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Road Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent a few hours after the aircraft was seen, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started on a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, some of the personal objects of Fossett were found in California, near the border with Nevada, by a couple near their house at the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two IDs with the name Fossetts, both issued by illinois by the Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a jacket.
The search for fosset had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002 he succeeded in the sixth run, as the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he surrounded the world in a single flight without interlanding with a plane.
Among his many records is an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andean, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
A suv that falls from the conventional schemas through its original design and special line management, the loading surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring new breath to the sector with this offroader.
It is precisely because of its exceptional properties that the Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
For example, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various fibers, which will take over the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como giving the whole a special view: the new Suv will thus appear as a three-dimensional model in its almost real dimensions.
In fact, the car will seem to emerge from the poster on which it is represented.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new glacier will be illuminated at different moments in all its details to reassemble itself as a whole.
It is undoubtedly the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new type of author advertising into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they are risking stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling after the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, have not caused serious problems until recently.
Never before has it come to collisions with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were found in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, where the cities of the soldiers appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a collision with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, 144 cards were made available to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among the travellers to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and travel to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal waits for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But, of course, there is fear of imitators who could follow them little more than 150.
"This fire must be set forth immediately, and that does not in any case provide the possibility of justifying such behaviour" says it from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on especially with regard to the game of the National Team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisory), on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (explained without pleasure) who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but without doubt the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – adds the Osservatorio No. 1 – crimes are punished in the country of their actions.
To date, this group had been in the throat, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pipes during the hymn of Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, there is no education..."
