28-year-old kitchen master was found dead in the shopping centre in San Francisco
The 28-year-old kitchen master recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at the local shopping centre gateway this week.
However, the victim's brother says that no one knows who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, "He's finally been doing well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was identified as 28 years old in San Francisco, France, Galicia, called San Francisco's office for the death penalty.
San Francisco Police Department said that death was identified as a death crime and that the investigation is underway.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a liner in Boston, had received his dream job as a liner in the Sanfrancisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters' representative said they were "indignationed and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a tight family, and he will be very missed," said the representative.
We will send our thoughts and our condolences to Frank's family and friends in this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the beginning of the hostels, but that recently "he was finally doing well."
"He found the apartment and met a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was goodwilled, and he had a great heart.
His way of feeling cohesive with the family was to make us food, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drove with the power.
"In the world, where so many things are wrong, he was a shiny diamond that shines brighter every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about this is asked to call the San Francisco police station's guideline at 415-575-4444.
Medical practitioners to the law: Requirements for new labour fighting measures
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new labour-fighting measures in their disputes on the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) invites the whole Council to support new working combat measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to take care of the deal.
In July, doctors trainees and doctor students voted against the agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of the members who voted.
In his letter to the members of the JDC, Ellen McCourt, published on Thursday night through Twitter, Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "supercely quiet" on issues that, according to him, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said, "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Government has today tabled a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for the progressing and broadening work programme early in September.
As a result of the dispute, doctors have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete workout in the history of the NHS health system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the director of BMA’s doctor practitioners, retired after the vote had been rejected by the agreement, the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before 54 000 doctors and students voted that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement will be ordered to the doctors of England.
Russia and Turkey: External Association?
Ele, who ended up in the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to hand each other and to declare that the fight against words and financial sanctions for eight months has officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter’s Palace, I had a clear impression that more people would like this reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, they've been bargaining on the occasion.
But Putin's smile looked like a crowd, and he did not threaten heat, even according to his own norms.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued to talk about his "loving friend" Putin five times, according to a report.
I blew in the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think that his enthusiasm represented the opposite.
But the Vileys from Putin showed that the Russian leader has never forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border.
The Moscow reaction at that time was annoying.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbed Moscow in his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a presumed friend.
Rebuilding real confidence will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turkish people were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Syrian territories under ISIS.
He's strongly denied this.
But at Peter the official message was that it was time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Mr Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of reaching out to hard arms are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power in the failure of the last month.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been severe, particularly the ban on order flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
The amount has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local travellers and ordering airlines will certainly be made easier when flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for the late season to run into the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since the re-authorisation of imports of agricultural products from Turkey.
"You toured there, the tomatoes back here," as in the Vedemosti report.
But the visit also had a political added value to Moscow.
There is anger to the Western countries about what is considered to be a weak response to the attempted coup of power.
In addition to the long-lasting horror of the advanced EU membership negotiations, Mr Puti, who is enthusiastic to take advantage of the coolness and to break the links of Turkey with the Western countries, emerges.
The Russian leader certainly got off points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survivor of Moscow, who has its own deep rooted fear of changing power.
So this meeting in the prame seafronts allowed the "external association" presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries who experience the Western countries having abandoned them and mistreated them, uniting their forces.
However, these two have great disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself to the role of the peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be much speaking that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question with regard to their disagreements, while Mr Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can seek a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster when a member of NATO shoots down a Russian fighter plane, it is certainly better that two leaders are even in conversation.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the Bank’s international objectives.
After the bank collapsed almost eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
In the meantime, the Bank's strategies have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer financing brands.
It supported millions of reds used for international sports sponsorship, Six Nations Rugby Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But it has now been considered appropriate to allow national brands to come to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland is operating with Scottish customers, but it will not be re-started.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of the headquarters and stock exchange lists, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available to customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The BBS brand will become our investor brand and employer of our employees, because we are now becoming a much more bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global objectives, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards the brand bank because basically (we have asked) is how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3000 wins
The detor sprays the champagne after he has a total of 3000 wins after the double win
Contestant Frankie Dettori secured 3,000 of his British profits in Newmarket on Friday.
With his second victory on his home track, he reached the flank of the night when he competed with John Gosden with the Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches this flank during the race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggotti, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold master hockey Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The Detor sucks his own charms when he brings Predilection out after the victory.
Two racers have reached this flank in the obstruction competitions - master hockey Richard Johnson and a 20-fold-lived champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 wins in his career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers in today's era, and it's not surprising that she's reached this flank that few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical brick separates him from the other weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for the competitions, his passion and charisma have dragged fans to the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that she would have ridden 6000 winners if she wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big race!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a drone landing from a saddle that formed a brand.
Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British racing race for two decades from the drone stops to the drone landings.
This has been a mountain trail.
In 1996 he rebuilt the wins in the major races, including his famous 'Mignificent Seven' win in Ascot, but he also survived the aircraft accident and suffered a ban on competition for drugs.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start when he returned after six months of a competition ban, but he showed a significant strength of character when he challenged doubters and returned in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time... the Dettor has previously said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly resigned Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inside for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed a Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin opinion stated that Mr Putin has "ordered Ivanov to move away from the roles of the presidential government in Russia", but there was no reason for this.
Since 2012, the Deputy Director of Ivanov, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol and government staff, called on the Kreml website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Vaino be appointed as his replacement.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, has been the Soviet Security Service at the KGB.
As head of office, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At the meeting of the state television with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had withdrawn on his own request.
But despite the smile on cameras, few people here are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just a remark of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been really suspiciously accepted.
In his comments on the Kreml website, Putin said to Ivanov, "it is true that early in 2012, I asked you to give for four years my responsibility for this very complex, perhaps even to say, task in the workplace.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He was formerly Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB State Security Service, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Vice-President.
When Putin rose to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
One time it was thought that Ivanov could become after the second period of Russian President Puti, because the third period of Puti would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another close covenant in Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to President only three and a half years later.
"Criminal Minds" star Thomas Gibson got fired after hitting the producer.
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, made an apology on Thursday before he was notified of his resignation.
There were creative differences and disputes on the site.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the statement of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from the FBI team are expected later.
Previously, 54-year-old, stared by Dharma & Greg, has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I can for the last 12 years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I've been hoping to be with you until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible working group and, above all, the best fans in the series.
The beginning of the twelfth production period of the series was scheduled for 28 September.
Mysteries ended up in the garden in Banff
The man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain thinks 75 fish could be windfish that the waterbike has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 meters away from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two - inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing location: Bridge now extends to Fife
1,35 billion pounds project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have connected Queensferry's crossing point to the north deck and the bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four seals between the "national threats", which are now graduated from the bridge around each of the three pillars.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slices.
The project for GBP 1.35 billion is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from land to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has spent more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this part of the bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the closing of the bridge to the bridge deck is a demanding operation where extreme precision measurements should be matched.
Altogether, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last part of the deck is rolled today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to lift onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a major column.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and combined with the broader northerly-seated road deck, then we had to close the remaining part from the north side, i.e. the internal side.
This was done by dragging the north road bridge 700 millimetres southward.
This was a huge and very demanding measure at the same time.
Because the land is 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and it had to be pulled at about 3% of the inclination angle.
It was difficult because the permissible measurement deviations, according to which the team worked, were tiny, just a few millimetres in both directions.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Rescue on Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy when they're alive"
Three men are "happy when they're alive" after they fell out of their fishing boat in front of Anglese.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station made an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event evolve in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued on.
"We saw the boat rotating closer to the men and we imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the cruiseman of Moelfre's rescue boat.
"Happyly, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we moved," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found tired hanging out of the drum without the rescue wings.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The engine of the boat had a dead-distance rope, but it had somehow dismantled the boat from the person who ran when the boat fell.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time by looking at the evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and participate in some activity.
The screen time was initially limited to television, then to video games and now recently to smartphones.
It is therefore awesome to see that technology and outdoor air activity do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to a wilderness called Pokémon Go. The application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s to video games (later then created a series of drawings, gaming cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had to some extent diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
Afterwards, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, because huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days Pokémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nut shell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons that can be traced using GPS and which can be "photographed" (by means of screenshot) or "catch".
The generation that played the game younger has joined the wilderness and jumped up on the couch with the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant addition to the "average person" in daily steps.
The Apple Watch application Cardiogram, followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game 30 minutes a day the number of people moving from 45 percent to 53 percent in the followers of Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees training level data.
Many public health campaigns' calls for "to find 30", "to rise from the couch" and "to be active every day" have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
Regularly mobile people have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activeness helps to control weight, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its advantages are too diverse here to be listed.
Pokémon Gon's fineness is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even get new friends in hunting.
As usual, the evil ghosts of joy are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk to the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were Fitbit-like applications that could be monitored for activity, they did not give reason for moving in the same way as this game.
The news attraction disappears and the use expands in time.
However, because of Pokémon's success, other games will come that combine applications and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in the women's gymnastics multiplay
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energy in the jumps.
It's smooth on a tree.
Unbelievable with a perma.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American champion reached the multi-stage championship on Thursday, leaving himself and the rest of the world in the light of the Olympics.
His total score, 62,198, was clearly better than Aly Raisman and the Russian pronssimitalist Aliya Blackfinan.
On Thursday, Simone Biles, the United States of America's Balancing Bar at the Final of Women's Fellowships in the Summer Olympics 2016 in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has succeeded in winning the multiplication championship, and a total of the fifth American champion. At the same time she strengthened her name for her generation, and perhaps for the best of all times.
He fell into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises his same class with the best athletes of other generations, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has mastered its species for the last three years, winning 15 World Championships, including 10 golds, with programs with a mixture of ambition and precision so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best athlete I see".
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between the burden of his and the overwhelming expectations.
Returning a family home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman take over after winning the gold and silver festival (in this order) at the final of the women's chair training for individuals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, August.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he acted as the peak of the living national team coordinator, Martha Karolyin, at the departure party.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of the future when walking to the top of my knowledge for a long time, it is not entirely true.
A part of his permanto program, including his brand's volt grip, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfectly suited to the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
From this girl that her grandparents adopted as a tapper, and whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip in the hall where Boorman trained, has become a force factor.
He has not lost in the multiplay since the summer of 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in small management after two rounds, it was just a miscarriage.
The balance tree and permanto, in which Biles is the ruling world champion, were waiting.
He climbed to the top at the punch points 15,433 and crossed them by getting 15,933 perma.
Raisman embraced him with goodwill when they waited for the endpoints, just formality, and tears rose up into the glitter-red, white and blue-limited eyes of Biles, when the dream of which he once wrote his book became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revancing from four years ago when he was in a divided third place, but lost the pronss to Blackfina in renewing.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, called Grandma by the Americans.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permantal performance in a emotional crash, which sometimes seemed questionable.
With regard to Biles, this 19-year-old wide-ranging twitting of this previous week will have a completely new meaning:
Police: Three serial murder victims were shot when they listened to music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who died in the most fatal attack of the first serial killer case in Phoenix last decade were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on 12 June.
The report tells us that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired the gun up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triangle doesn't seem to have been the result of the robbery, because the attacker did not take handbags or 2900 dollars from another adult victim.
Phoenix Police Officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that shooting made the investigators check whether it was in connection with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have died and two have been wounded in the course of the nine attacks that have taken place over the past four months, which have been carried out in two mainly Latin American districts.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month CBS's subsidiary to KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissani in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related to each other and are done by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, got to a hospital later killed because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the venue.
The Witness told the police that they were often sitting in a car parked and listening to music.
The authorities also published a police release about the shooting of a police release, which took place only half an hour before the trim and which was the subject of an empty open-package car, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The scientists found bullets seals, bullets in a seat, and bullets in a motorway space.
Mother of 6 years of age with microcephalia: "The situation will be eased"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But, unlike a large proportion of his agemates, Edmund is a small person, a result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he came home for the first time, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise you to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walk line.
Edmund didn't sit or crash until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
But he's slowly reaching some arrows.
He walks with help and drives on a bicycle.
Besides, he loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth will show me how the sign that Edmund invented refers to "what you'd say to me."
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language, he tells me Edmund has invented some of his own violets.
Microcephalia may be due to a number of different causes: genetics such as Edmund, or pregnancy viral infections such as ash carocco or Zika virus.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected by Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden caused by the uncertain future.
I just asked what's going on.
What's going to happen?
And he doesn't really know.
Actually, I haven't asked for a prophecy for a long time, because I do not expect anyone to really be able to give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice to mothers whose babies have a birth fault due to Zica.
It's getting easier.
You can believe that the situation will make it easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Raising and flooding caused rescue operations in Mississippi in Louisiana
The fierce and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the Governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected to be in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their dams and caused a large flooding due to extremely severe rainfall.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with the local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the districts in need of it.
Mike Steele, representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Preparatory Office, said that they would receive requests for upstream vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipaho County alone asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The floodwave is valid until Saturday in a large part of South Louisiana.
In the opinion, the weather service said that there are still three to five centimeters more rain in the region.
In the south of Alabama, the floodwave was in force on Friday when the rain continued in the area of Mobile.
The Committee River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood peak during the weekend.
The weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood in several houses in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is lower than the flooding of the Ascension district along the river, when the flooding rivers slowly land into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi State border in Lousiana Liverpool, was at the highest level of all times on Friday morning 9:00.
Saviors were still picking up people from the flood in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississip.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and nephew were near Glosteria on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that, normally, at a distance of more than 400 feet from his house, Beaver Creek's water quickly rose during the night.
He says that another close-up son-in-law warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It stretched up to my size.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen the stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have all the injuries, and that he is the only bathing skilled person.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved them in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods are "swiftly spreading" in the process of continuing heavy rain, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday the country had been completely exhausted by the heavy rain.
The scourge and flooding of streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of the district of Tangiphaho from their homes and to the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS's subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangiphaho, a member of the City Council said 200 homes had been flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but both of them are now under flood.
The president of the district, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained as an island in the rising water.
Amites and Hammond cities have been opened to those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangiphaa, twenty streets were closed because of the rising water, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sand bags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last major flood here was in March," said the city administration authority Lacy Landrum.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported with floods, but no floods have been reported until Friday.
Keith Townson, Director of the Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
"Full the bullets" was six years old Mahaj Brown survived Philadelphia shooting
The police tell us that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in town this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had several gunshot wounds, among other things, in the leg, in the hand and in the stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his small body was full of bullets," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the condition of a boy has been registered as critical and several surgery has been carried out.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting the first class at the local subschool.
Brown was one of four shots in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One 29-year-old male was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front of the car in conjunction with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the position reported.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a cross between several shooters.
Types of shells of a gun coming from different guns filled the venue.
Looks like this was definitely a continuous fight.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the corridor.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active battle," said Philadelphia's chief of police Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area also got hits.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating the surveillance camera tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a misleading bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane's neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year the women's Olympic sports team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every Summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team includes three athletes, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the involvement of dark and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful women's gymnast has been African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is amazing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised as a winner of the Olympics, and America hurried.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible achievements of threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez in which they present unexpected but masterly sports programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman who has winning individual gold in women's diversion.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five), because the following Olympic sports team will have only four athletes, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that sports is a expensive species, and athletes practice mostly in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers and their athletes and families) and the list continues.
Most of these sports clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support species.
In these clubs, sportsmen receive all their training, and this is a expensive and long - term commitment to sportsmen’s families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both trained their athletes since they started the gym.
We should bring more affordable and available training in communities where many young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable sports in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-level sports for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
The athletes develop the body’s strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as the effort, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health as well as school and work success.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start training, and it's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing the serious "girl force" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical practitioners organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 practitioners who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed the plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was "unidentified soil", and that even small additional delays damage staff and patients.
The first doctoral interns will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to the night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Doctors, said last night in its opinion: "The doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, particularly that it will accelerate the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors fairly."
When the time before the first group of doctors is transferred to the new contract remains for only eight weeks, progress needs to be made and the time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government's willingness to participate and sometimes deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanction and take into account the concerns of doctors practitioners.
If he does not, doctoral interns are ready to continue their work fights.
At the end of April, the last strike meant almost 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 withdrawal periods, when nurses and doctors were recruited to replace doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend chart for 54,000 practitioners under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to doctors to prevent them from going to the court.
Mortimer said: "The fights are accomplished very little or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services already in demand, and cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been discussing the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and the Whistleblowing (Whistleblowing).
Employers hoped that the ongoing positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returning from sabbath-free, costs of education, mutual recognition of the educational programme, non-study and gender pay gaps in medicine - would be a sign of the seriousness of employers, the Health Education England Education Organisation and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine paying two pounds a day may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients benefit from two pounds per day after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans for a longer period.
The anticoagulant medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with cardiac disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or a second stroke.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS’s supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people each year have a heart attack in England, and one quarter of them have a second stroke or stroke.
Convulsions and strokes are due to fats accumulated in the artery wall, which form greases.
If the tightness breaks, it can cause blood clotting that prevents blood circulation into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the coagulation depletes, it may go with the blood and break the blood circulation into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, an Isobritanian company, sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making coagulation less likely.
Today published NICE draft guidance recommended that 90 mg of ticagrelor be administered to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective treatments to prevent progress, even a quarter of the people who have suffered a heart attack will later receive another heart attack or stroke, with the consequences of which are often destructive."
Fear of regeneration may have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor and aspirin are effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we first recommend ticagreloria, we are pleased to add available treatment options to several thousands of people who might benefit from it.
Since data on efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially with regard to the risk of bleeding - are limited over a period of more than three years, the draft guidance is not recommended longer than for this period.
The culture of political correctness permits the flourishing of elections in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from his office last year because of corruption, giving a boost to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to ignoring the widespread fraud in the Muslim communities, which is revealed today in a shocking government report.
The former minister of the government Sir Eric Pickles puts the police, election officers and city councils on the ground that they have ignored the evidence of violence on the grounds of "racial and religious hypersensitivity".
The former secretary of the Community, the current Emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so serious that the police should be allowed to put security chains outside the polling stations to protect those who were afraid.
He recommends that the voters present their identity certificate when they vote to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the voting person should put in his finger unremovable ink so that no one could vote twice.
They should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access to the documents and decisions of the delegation made by the informal committees or the working group.
"This would not only protect against elections, but would protect local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with elections," he said.
The government ordered a report following the vote scandal of the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from the post as a result of numerous charges against corruption and illegal action.
The Court noted Rahman's "cynically distorting" religious feelings of its Muslim community and silenced its critics by accusations of racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of loyal Muslims to vote on him.
Up to 300 votes were conceivable or resulted from the fact that a person would vote in a different way.
Sir Eric said there's evidence in the wilderness in the whole country.
He expressed particular concern in voting by the mail of the elections, in which the members of the Muslim community of high quality were said to have pressured people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the clearance of the voting system, including the certification of identity by identity certificate.
He says: "The evidence was presented that the vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"It was suggested to be concerned that the state institutions had ignored such behaviour because of the "politically correct" oversensitivity of race and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals for the cleansing of the system, including the prohibition of political activists to deal with ballot tickets sent by mail in order to end "stems gathering".
The report to be examined by Theresa May also calls for more stringent amendments to registers in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider the options for certifying the identity of voters before voting.
Use the indispensable ink on the finger of the person voting the ink so that no one can vote twice.
Make systematic national audits to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail vote.
Preclude political activists from dealing with ready voices and envelopes sent through mail.
Let the police set the guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of fear on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal in polling places.
Require that voting places be used only in English (except in Wales).
Enhance training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the bar on his own.
Sir Eric shares the London police forces, saying that it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court remained following the numerous corruption and illegal actions of Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
On the basis of a number of criteria, he was found guilty without any doubt, according to the criminal threshold of evidence.
He also criticised ineffective "short-screen" checks in the polling agencies of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Toren Hamlets sentence was an awakening.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the birther of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of the elections and the banning of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Insane Kate's bicyclists and other famous pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rion 2016 Olympics have gone confused with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double creature of the Duke of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete who fights gold this summer, who can cheer on his own famous double being, at least according to the social media.
So to honor all the famous faces on our screens at the Rio races, FEMAIL has made up a list of Olympic athletes who seem to be Hollywood famous.
The hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. team of men's flexible shooting team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s bias, many online people have been quick to point out how a certain sniper could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a team member of the American men's flexible shooting team, has caused a storm on Twitter since he got up to the surface of his pictures, where he seems scary like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the passion of the social media, the sniper admitted that he had heard from the child that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance, except maybe the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London from 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the amazing equation of the British long-term jumpers between Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Blackfina, with its great, obvious eyes, has been said to be a Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan's double creature.
And in the pool, a southern African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared for years with the star Glee Matthew Morrison.
Larger switch to eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett with similar strong corner hairs and lips.
The Russian silver-amitalist Yulia Efimova has more than the same actress Annalynne McCord than browned skin and white hair, while the American team Nathan Adrian reminds the fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's sports version".
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between a couple of similarities
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website that "others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an unbelievably similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the actress Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal won by sponsor Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile matches the smile of the bring it on star Gabrielle Union.
CBC's Olympic commentator asks an apology after he said a Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis, instead of the fourth of Ai Yanhan’s 14-year-old, of the 4x200-metre free swimming message for women, was annoying the audience of the CBC’s direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its reporters said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "was lost like a bad smell" and "dood as a pig".
Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the 4x200 m women's free swimming final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporter team to bring "colour", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China, your mold, baby.
Too zealous, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimt a message at the second part at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch China.
Lookers around Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer's death like a pig???
The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct transmission."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan was described in the 4 x 200 metres of women's free swim final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China your mold, baby."
Review Byron MacDonald against Twitter was a hero and fast, many challenge him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how ignorant Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racist people.
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC mission, asked for apology in direct transmission to MacDonald's comment, saying: "We are sorry that the comment on the bathing performance had been sent.
It was a regrettable choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended to apologize for more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
Afterwards, CBC copied and sent an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologised and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and sent straight.
Last night, we quickly took action and, in direct transmission, we apologised to our viewers and to our followers in social media.
For reasons of clarity, it should be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and sad choice of words, and Mr Byron is very sorry for saying it.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised for the direct transmission and tried to define his comment by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after a woman's message," he said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client of a stubborn woman who rudely arranged underwear in the middle of the trade
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
After assessing what she looked like in her pants, she did not make things better and put it back on the shelves.
He continued the tour and finally arranged four underwear in a store located in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark's business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where a woman put in underwear and then put them back in a shelf
At the same time, two children's mother Jenny Davidson said that after trying underwear, a mysterious woman "feeded again and walked away from the shop without buying anything".
He said, "Humans didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took out a pair of underwear, took off her own trousers and underwear, and put her feet fit.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he was just standing in that shameless."
"Everyone stared, while he took off the underwear and obviously didn't like them, because he put them back on the shelves."
He did the same for three more couples before finally decided that he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who looked at or thought about a person who would end up buying the underwear he made."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent's city, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone takes home the underwear that someone else has tried, but which have not been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I thought the staff would seem to have tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is really good."
"It would be awful to go home with new underwear and see that another woman has dressed them up and removed them, and they have not been washed."
Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone's movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to find out how to deal with gun-drivers at a distance.
We approached you before or behind, this video shows how you can pay the attacker with the same size.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached backwards, the first thing you need to do is turn around is to see your attacker and then you're having a fire line.
After that, you'll catch the gun between the elbow arm and the shoulder before you hit the attacker with your free elbow.
Continue to hit the knee on the knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, turn the gun from his hands, hit him with a gun behind his face, and retreat with the gun directed against him.
If the armed person is approaching the front, the technology is similar: remove your body from the fire line, capture the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun from him, turn back and point him with a gun.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's Grand Master, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright slicks the dirtest places in Europe for a guide
The British traveller has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and his vomiting reflectors by licking some of the most dirty and nightly places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a contractor and mobile writer from Suffolk, would arrow euro banknotes, a cap in Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button on the train toilet and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used the photometer to show himself and us the situation he was facing.
However, the experiment made by a film called Internal Power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the rinsing button used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Through Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him in the mouth of a bad taste.
Wright became a known tester of endurance in traveling around the world and eating strange and marvelous things.
This mission, extending from the ceilings of the public railway stations to the toilet rinse button, really tested his immune system.
In the film he said, "Since the child, I've been quite careless about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth from the mud, the worms and the strains of water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
In his sample, there were more than 4,000 units in the fotometrie.
Because of the comparison, it should be less than 60 to read the washed hands.
But in a Russian public hall he refused to arrow when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the washed hands was less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, along with the Finnish dairy, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the movie he said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna do anything like that because there's something to do here.
The traces of internal power were produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains milk acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
The leader of Vali's snacks, juice and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas out of the air, and we ended up in the idea of "what I can call Ian?"
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film enables us to tell more about it in an interesting way to consumers.
I also believe that the document shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The document director Tom Hakala added: "Let's just say it like this: if Ian had slicked some of the things I asked him for, such as a nightmare in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty firefighters recorded."
In the 2015 poll, 84 per cent of respondents combined milk acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the belly and intestine, and 58 per cent said that at least between times they use products that have been added to milk acid bacteria.
The family destroyed the renthouse in Cornwall's Saltash, before the wedding.
The bribery family caused the damage of the rented house to 50,000 pounds after they were cast off because of the terroristization of neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall in Saltash after numerous complaints.
When they had been removed from the property by means of force, shocked residents of the housing company found the property to be in poor condition.
The walls had been filled with mounting holes, the floor vessels had been cut, the waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been destroyed with graffits.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in a private settlement.
Conna McEvoy, the host of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants and I do not think people should have to live in this way.
There are many points to consider, as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is badly famous, and their name is badly famous."
The couple had three sons who lived in the real estate, and according to the police, the horror of the family had a street fight with baseball fights, intimidation of close residents, drug use, sale of drugs, and rude shouting, fighting and cursing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who was named as a lease contract, received a decision in June on an imsocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under threat found old waste.
The property, from which drugs have previously been handed out, had been pushed up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing gave them 11 weeks of time to change voluntaryly by means of powerful means the property of a woman and this partner this week.
Enlightened neighbors thanked the wedding, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here that we haven't used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
The Executive Director of Cornwall Housing, Adam Fitzpatrick, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property
The garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the renthouse.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, because the wedding is always the last method considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, because the conduct was extreme, and their actions certainly horrified neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the courageous members of the community who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that anti-social use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three sons all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in twenty.
After wedding, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The company's employees now have to clean the waste sheets surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police made a ride to the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as va'a, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received fines when he granted his guilt for possession of Class B drug as an intention to share it forward.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in the car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partners live homeless after they have been frozen in a private place in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffits.
The police say they're trying to dismiss the inhabitants who keep the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said that the resignation was a clear warning to other tenants who continued to keep the rules in ridicule.
"This is a message to those who think that their behavior is without sanctions, as well as to those who suffer from such behaviour," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Travellers in Portugal were terrified when the warfare plane flew down the shore at the low hipova
Sun worshipers in Portugal experienced the shock of their life
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force would wipe off very low
Air Force said that it was an exercising flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At the moment, horrified tourists began to be alarmed when the low - aired shower machine was wiped over the full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came from sun worshipers on the sand band in North Portugal near the contact distance.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandly worry about the noise of the shower machine, even though they did not at first see what behind the clouds was coming toward them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, last afternoon.
One of the numerous tourists who published videos of a dramatic transition in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice really low, and together it seemed like it was falling down to the ground."
Nuno Arrooja added: "I was surfing and really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists at the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the machine appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
Today, the Portuguese Air Force said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on an exercising flight aimed at identifying fishing boats near the coast, and the aircraft had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the shower machine had flew significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility of close fires, but the air forces assured that no safety was at risk.
This summer, the fires have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal, and four people have died on the Madeira island.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force said that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions of low visibility, the smoke caused by fires and the thick fog,
The plane was on an exercising flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercising exercise.
I lost the result of the first half of the year better than expected
The social and health district of South Karelia (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million more effective in January - June.
In the first half of the year, the result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment warranty was carried out in all activities.
This year, Exote is trying to shorten the lines of action.
Exote covers the deficit previously incurred by the surplus.
The remaining share may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The results are expected to be better than planned at EUR 4.6 million throughout the year.
The Government of Exoten will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border icers swore a military oath in Immo
On Friday, 70 crews at the Border and Marine School swore a military oath.
The military whale event of Border and Marine School crews was held in Immo on Friday.
The Tenth Special Ice Course was held at the equipment's sports field.
The military vow swore 70 of the crew.
Special border icers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve for 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for as a special limit icer.
They invited 250 of them to the selection tests.
Special limit icers have been trained in Immo since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in the context of the valación took part in five wartimes of border forces veteran.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.

A lot of rubbish above - criminal investigation helps detecting crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
From the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police institutes has operated by the RTA, the criminal investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
A total of four police officers are present in the police department in Lahti and Hämeenlinnan.
It's pulled up by a sergeant placed in the Bay.
Chief of Staff in Lt. Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a dedicated civilian to IT in Hämeenlinnan.
Everyone's working in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and need, says Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces a variety of reports to the other police.
It has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the most recent reform of the police's working methods.
The aim was to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police would never go on the spot until they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities will be targeted wherever they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal investigation centre was established, under three national units, and a criminal investigation unit was established for each police station.
The PTR centre in Vantaa, in connection with the Central Crime Police, runs nationally.
The PTR units work according to their name from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, for their part, are working in areas divided according to police agencies and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Information extends outside your area
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police station.
Inquiry also extends beyond the borders of your own institution, because crime does.
People working in the RTA unit have better basic police IT skills.
With the help of registers, alarm database and observations, the Unit is seeking to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or crimes that are similar to each other.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal investigation.
All people have their own way of doing.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of making, the factor is made up of a certain type of image.
Seriesing can be done either on the basis of a practice or by a person, depending on which police have more information.
The criminals learn from their mistakes
The workers of the RTA unit don't move the city's necks up, but their work is not fully public.
The methods used by both criminals and their own are not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus attempting to prevent police crime attempts.
The police will be told publicly about the procedures if they predict to pose a threat.
Such a case, for example, was newsed from the beginning of the summer, using a method of marking empty dwellings in housing breaks.
There, the authors put a boot, a needle or a tape on the outer door of the apartment, which they tried to see whether the inhabitants were actually on their way.
The pre-investigation material shall be public for at least the parties concerned.
The Analytical Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they have made.
The most ugly are ordering a district court protocol, which can indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found here.
The next time, the thieves will leave their gloves in their hand.
The case has been interviewed with Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppä from Hämeen police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from East Finland police, Detective Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuun police station and Detective Arto Tuomela from Central Crime Police.
The police are collecting and analysing information to plan practical action.
Underpinned by a reduction in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken already 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
Kingdom cooperation collects information outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl joining fathers from London killed in Syria
According to rumors, Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join Isa, has died in Syria.
Advocate Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in the Russian air attack to Raqqa, which is the organization’s base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just when he was planning to escape the war from breaking the land and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a gravestone and a testament to others, that there are real risks of leaving the war area - that it could make people give up such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other Eastern London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they went by bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that the girl had married the Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he is elected.
President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the Presidential candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
The leader of the Senate majority Mitch McConnell says that the next president will elect a person to replace Antonin Scalia, a Member of the Supreme Court who has lost.
Reid said on Thursday's phone talk that he predicted "with some certainty" Clinton's choice of Garland.
The representative of Reid later said that he had not talked directly to Clinton about whether he would name Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team didn't want to "show the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the principal judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia district.
Reid said that the republicans who prevented Garland from appointing the republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "managers" and "possibles".
He said Trump isn't fit for the job.
Treats says the naked calendar is "for women as well as men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemeren to publish the calendar inspired by Pirell in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of the naked celebrities, they are going to find their next NU Muse calendar of the peak generation 2017.
The Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his leaves containing plenty of naked pictures are different from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this to women.
Apparently he thinks that the calendar is for them too.
"We need to start presenting timeless and classic nakedness again, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by the pictures of these naked female body," Shaw said in the press release, where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures through the network or personally in open choices in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of the vinyl: who actually buys records?
All alone, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you start filling the comment with annoyed insults with the name of the author NotAllSingleMen Men, notice that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, a lot of talked records are not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are enthusiastic about the enthusiasm of physical objects, but about the mid-life enthusiasm.
Apparently, those who have bought a vinyl record in the near future are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, all the most unlikely records are purchased in the age group of 18-24 years.
The issue is also not only the collection of hobbies, but also an emotional significance: older buyers of vinyls are slightly more likely to hold their feelings within (56 % vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69 % vs. 66%).
But do YouGov's results be true?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I walk in the middle of the busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit above me. I would like to point out vividly before I stop, form a cup of my hands and say something valuable, such as: "Let's get a closer look at this."
Let's get a closer look at it.
At the same time, while Soo's charm and dirt are slowly removed, hotels, chain shops and office supplies stores now fill buildings with previously independent movements - a handful of fantastic specialised disc shops are still in place.
For the next part, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men from some of these shops trying to assess by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (computer: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (computer: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spend their afternoon in London because of the meeting, and round shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These discs that appear in the picture above (he sent the sample by e-mail, not followed him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge number of discs and singles is partly the result of his available revenues: now he can buy discs that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and moneyless.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, albums that were published when I was 11 or 12, which I was probably a little too young for," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and add: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my bad."
25-year-old Wez, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she's meeting will fit in with YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media's enthusiasm. People who have heard that the discs have come back to fashion and who have come to the need to buy back their old albums.
On the basis of the discussions I have conducted, people have usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl acetates in certain ages.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that disc stores offer a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured especially by the near-payment system.
Some vinyl fans can disturb the digital world and choose to trust in the durability of familiar discs; objects that raise teenage happy days memories.
"I think it may sometimes be about filling the gap or some sort of comfort that the possession of objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill the thoughts.
"We're like their social workers," the other worker said, "we're like their social workers."
The opinion question made by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% of the album players have a record player that they never use, while 7% of the buyers of vinyls have no record player.
In this section of the news report, I would probably seem to be seriously concerned when I browse the edge of the bossa nova collections.
This awake's "pricing" angle is something that also has been noticed by Jonny, 42, working in Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men).
"Somebody came in a little time ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy the Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelve'," he says.
This is not a big part, but this is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not parents, but younger people, late ages, who are just about to be enthusiastic about it.
In the fop, which today has almost a whole layer reserved for vinyls, there is a much more versatile audience when I arrive.
Seventeen pairs, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above mentioned movements - the sound of the Wild Beasti's freshest sinful and sexually full pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but a melancholy psychological trauma is difficult to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes watching the various albums in sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me that it doesn't make much, so record collection is not really a choice.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of the vinyl is..." he loves.
"I don't know how to explain... it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised the new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at jeanshorts, I noticed a group of teenage girls who are gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter thought about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left there is a staircase with the wall covered by Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential discs of any average collection.
No one looks at them, perhaps because they're just decorative, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's just art vinyls.
But given that even the small attention received by these items may mean more money to the industry and send some customers to Soho's cancers to apply for more, there is little complaining.
It is not surprising that the population with more likelihood of time and money for others is also the one who uses the most luxury items, such as vinyls.
But although my findings indicate that the results of YouGov are accurate at least in Soho's disc stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and fans of vinyls that exist in the real world, disc stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or at the office.
They really don't spend their Thursday mornings grinding around the Berwick Street disc stores, blazing the records and avoiding the horrifying 30-year-old television trainer's look at this when he sneaks over the shoulders of the unoffensive middle-aged men.
The Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Researchers say that the holker has a longer lifetime than any other planetary spine.
Julius Nielsen, a hay researcher, says that the record is a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and that is five meters long.
The French Court rejects the application to unlock the trade in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected Calais's application to unload tens of temporary stores and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to unlock 72 temporary trades in which people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food in a few Euros in temporary food conditions.
Calais's Prefect's office justified that the places should be unloaded because they represent the non-payable parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and cleansing.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by the state-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food to the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often offer protection and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for dismissing 72 temporary traders, but said that Calais's concern was "completely comprehensible".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role than feeding people in "extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the premises offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat was camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activity is unprofitable, offering 200 meals daily, English and French hours, as well as asylum counselling for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafeteria.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
On Friday, two charitable organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - at the highest level - since the number of arrivals increased sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU average
In Finland, food is very cheap for consumers to be happy and harmful to producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly 5% in Finland in three years, with a price drop by 0.9% on average in the EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have declined to the second most in Finland in EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
Only in Britain has the price of food declined faster than in Finland.
The information appears from the article of Statistics Finland's Development Manager, Ilkka Lehtisen, published in the Information & Trends Blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed your turn, after which food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the price is pressed by Russia's bans on food imports, which have blocked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in a short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decline.
Large trading chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been seen as prominent advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the stimulus of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU countries in Finland with the same wage level as Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT percentage, Finland would sell the third cheapest food from similar countries.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were in seven tax countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT should be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continued price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations made by him with the VAT percentage are directional.
The school isn't all the same.
A returning person to the school bench may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is a guide for all Finnish schools to operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of handwriting is abandoned, and instead, in schools, coding is started.
Sweden's education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and societal lessons are already read by four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how you try to make schooling more interesting.
The longest spine in the world was found - ice sharks can live for up to 400 years
Even known as ice sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches genus maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spine in the modern world.
In the animal, it is only a Icelandic mushroom whose oldest known individual has been dated for the age of 507.
Green sharks are floating along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Women stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres.
As the growth rate is slow, monitoring shows only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks of 28 females who had remained in fishermen's catches.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiocarbon limitation of lenses.
For at least 272 years, the mean life of the reefs studied was shown.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimetres of amazonian population, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only achieve genus maturity over four metres, researchers have calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann's fired for almost 300 people, they won't reduce sales.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of the negotiations is a reduction of about 300 jobs, most of which are in the form of redundancies", says Stockmann.
According to it, the number of merchants in stores is not reduced so that the customer service is not affected.
In addition, some 80 support workers are offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's core negotiations concern about 3,000 employees.
At their start, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction is intended to reduce the annual cost of around EUR 20 million, which is expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve EUR 50 million savings this year.
In the background, Stockmann's difficulties to get profitable from the merchandise store.
Although the Group's adjusted business performance improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the merchandise trade continues to lose.
According to Stockmann's CEO Lauri Veijalainen, the sales in stores have not exceeded the objectives set by the company.
"Personal reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive business performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen notes in the newsletter.
In particular, the success of the Lindex clothing chain was reflected in the second quarter’s performance improvement.
The chain achieved its best turnover and results in the second quarter of all times.
Lindex’s operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, at the corresponding time, the entire Stockmann Group's operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's Group's turnover will decrease last year.
The corrected business result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north - temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland holds the weather on a sad Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also rainbows in the middle of the earth, but the south is more rainy.
The temperature is no longer very high in summer, as mercury is below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, they stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes a strange explanation for the coach’s trick of doping scandal
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as a country team athlete in the doping test.
The news office AP told me that an athlete who tried to perform Anzrah is a star of 800 meters, Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya’s country team, told me that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample in Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to the Anzrah authorities.
So it was said that Anzrah was sent home because he " committed his crime against the Kenyan country team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," Kip Keino, President of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, in turn, would send the news office to Reuters.
The Olympics are starting on Friday, and Rotich is supposed to run at the time.
It is not yet known whether there are any consequences for the runner.
Rotich was placed last year at the World Championships for a fourth time and has pre-winning Rio favors.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan general sports team, in turn, claimed that Anzrah was traveling with an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal," the source told.
Where's everybody?
Rion's general sports stadium blew its void
Where's everybody?
At least they're not watching the Rio Olympic Stadium.
On Friday, a fight for the medals of general sports began in Rio, but the world’s top solos were allowed to present their skills to a disconcertingly empty viewer.
On Friday, the organisers of Rio told us that only 58 per cent of the flags of the first day of the morning and 65 per cent of the flags of the evening.
The other one was four years ago in London, where the stadium pulled out the charming people.
Final tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
Rion’s spectator’s squad of the Olympics has drawn attention before the general sports.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches on rugby, melodas and horseback riding.
When the Brazilian medal wishes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, there was only 70% full of it.
After the Brazilian double, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12,000 people were still full of about 30%.
At least the bad course explains that Brazil, in economic difficulties, is far away from European and Asian Kisturists, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get pulled into the football stadium.
The mediator Mario Andrada told us this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"Remains 1.1 million to be sold," Andrada said Reuters.
A total of 8.5 million tickets from the Olympics in London were sold by 8.2 million, although almost half of them were more expensive than in Rio.
In Rio, the price of tickets has changed from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
In London's Olympic volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last moment.
However, in Rio, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolmen in countries with less known species, such as golf and rugby.
In the stadium of Rio, there were plenty of empty spaces in the morning.
Even the beach ball in Copacaba's sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There's enough people in the newspapers.
A new way to protect the environment - get a right to land
The Helsinki Foundation contributes to nature conservation by the latest means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant habitats.
After that, private individuals, businesses and entities may redeem property rights with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lap.
The area has been virtually divided into blocks that willing to acquire withholding rights against payment.
The holder shall be entitled to 187 square square blocks of a veto, which means, in practice, that no approval is required by each holder if the purpose of the land is to change.
Holder rights can also be acquired in several blocks.
Acquisition of administrative power is something concrete that can be left inherited or gifted.
No need to go to carry bandrolls or chains themselves somewhere to protect the environment", explains Juha Leviakangas, who has acquired the right to control its company.
The person who has acquired the right of administration receives accurate location information in his block, allowing, for example, a visit at the block.
On the Foundation's websites, the names of the holders of copyrights appear on the same map where the land block information can be found.
The Leviakangas sees its acquisition of nature as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way inequality or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The fundamental idea of the Helsinki Foundation Holder project is to protect natural areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either through purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to enter Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki trade fair on 13-19 August.
Cycling thieves are pissing out the biggest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality
Cycling thieves are most plagued by the major cities of Finland in Turkey.
This year, more wheels have been stolen from the number of inhabitants than in the other nine largest cities.
On the basis of the wheel thieves reported to the police, Helsinki’s News explained the extent to which in the ten largest towns of January to August this year stolen bicycles and parts of bicycles are calculated as a thousand per capita.
In addition to the Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, four to five wheel thieves per thousand people were carried out.
On the other hand, only about two wheel thieves per thousand people were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In these cities there is a double number of thieves in relation to the number of inhabitants," described the police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board.
The police of Turku are wondering why the city is at the comparison site.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The generality of the reserves can be influenced by the amount of wheels in the city and how much wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Määs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, expects Turkey, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of wheel thieves is largely based on the study and cycling cities.
There is a close center, short distances and a lot of wheels available to thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where the city centers are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary mobility tool," Reen says.
In all Finland, there has been slightly less wheel stealing in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the declining trend in recent years, the police are getting a little more than 20,000 wheel thiefs every year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, because only one part of the victims tells the police of theft.
Reen urges people to report a crime report on bike theft, although fewer than every tenth case reported to the police.
Typical of theft of the bike is the one where the police get information about the thief immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be solved during other investigations when, for example, in the drug case, stolen wheels can be found in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, wheel thieves are caught every week for their own work or in connection with the police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from commercial centres' wheels, indoors, warehouses and bicycle cellars, which is practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
The most individual bike models are stolen like Jopo's in the past years.
The U lock gives the bike a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves, for example, take a bike for their own short-term use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on sale via the internet, for example.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not noticed that stolen wheels would go hardly abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, stolen wheel buyers are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful because he may be guilty of a hidden crime or a hidden crime.
Reen says, "The evaporators should call if a good-purpose bike is sold at a very low price.
Special libraries officer Severi Hirvi wears his colorful Nopsans for his working day to the protectors of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but no one has been stolen, says Hirvi. "Nothing has ever been taken, there has been a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there is not necessarily a hipster value," the Helsingie Hirvi thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was quickly set up in the Kiosk in Helsinki, locked his bicycle on a small U lock.
Now the bike sneaked the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike in something fixed, such as the wheel drive.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsingfors student about his white bike, whose frame alone paid about five hundred euros.
"How much time do you hear from friends that the wheels have been taken?"
Mostly bad wheels, such punk yopos.
A bike was stolen from the houseyard a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve could wait for it.
People under 15 years of age responsible for their crimes?
Helsingfors experiments with the U.S. jurys
In Helsinki, the so-called jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal circuit.
Initially, the experiment will be applied to people under 15 who are now without criminal responsibility.
The Comparative Judgment intervenes in the first young person's crime.
The idea is that the jury will discuss with the perpetrator of the crime and impose the penalty.
A week later, the offender himself can join the jury to compensate for his deeds.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Action, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargain
"Everything leads young people into a more responsible direction so that not everything is ruined by the first mistake," says the Institute.
A model from the United States has been introduced to the Comparative Jury, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, a young person will not be confronted with an adult panel but reflect on what has happened about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, the service design agency followed by the experiment, says that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It has been a message that you will continue on the road you have chosen," Lovio says.
The Comparative Jury is part of the Immigrant Youths Helsinki project, which is underpinned by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all in need, not just to immigrants.
More than 70 Republican opponents want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter requesting the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. magazine Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his ignorance, incompetence and record disproportion, threaten to bring a sound belt to the democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only direct allocation of all possible funds to the Congress elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorative anchor in their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections will be reduced every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is apparently the republican Andrew Weinstein, who is opposed to Trum.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "humans who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and is not in favour of anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, which are believed to have injured millions of voters.
Furthermore, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief to American families of children
In the United States, the Presidential candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be President so that the US economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
In the middle of Clinton's plan, there is a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve the US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The building programme is a hand-sharing programme for American dunes who suffer from the transition of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme as the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a building nation, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the role of working children’s families.
On Thursday, he heard from Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to the tax tax, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he supported before.
"As President, I am opposed to all trade agreements that operate against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it "supply only these kinds of millionaires".
Trumpi's proposal for a reduction in corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's porehole".
On Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America a big one again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton pictioned.
These are Rion's audience numbers: The races have not glued Finnishs to the screens, but the mobile application is interesting
Usually, the sports competitions are seen in television viewers’ statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached high numbers of viewers.
At the same time, the races have climbed 12 per cent of the population to the top of the screens: on Tuesday night, the Yle Olympic Channel followed 615 000 viewers.
For a comparison: the EM competitions in general sport a month ago received nearly 800 000 viewers at TV2 at a time, and the EM competitions in football fairly second million.
To date, most of the Olympic species have been interested in cycling Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, which both reached almost half a million visitors at the Olympic channel at a time.
The senior sports manager, Panu Pokkinen, is satisfied with the spectators' numbers and reminds us that the spectators will for the first time be divided into several different instruments in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns are following the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers at all choose the Olympics.
Even on TV, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports contest for which Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are viewers throughout that time from 20 000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London competitions or in the 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference explains the difference in time - a large proportion of Rio race broadcasts will be in Finland at night.
The second reason for their negligible interest - if someone now considers it to be negligible - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise medal from the first races, the interest would have fallen upwards with it.
In addition, public sports are just starting, as are other Finnish interested species: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkise, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When the general sport begins, the audience numbers will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for races, which rose in the first days of the races in Apple's App Store as the most downloaded app for free in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been loaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already on the way for 200 000 downloads.
"We'll only get the audience numbers later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users hopefully.
Pokinnen says feedback has come and the defects have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delay and other small technical problems in the early stage.
Applications have updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympics of Rio will be seen on the Yle channels and arena more extensively than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can monitor some species, and the Yle Speech broadcasts races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be seen both on the Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to the official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, with a depth of 95.3 metres on the Cross.
It may be even deeper.
Technological diving trainer Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters in Crosssel, with a depth of 104 metres in the base of the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to in vain strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method does not necessarily find a small deepening at 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
Thus, the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvaswatersi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres range from Saima, Toisvesi and the Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Day.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately identified.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kanela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Day will not reach the ten deepest and Suvasvesi is even further away from the top.
Corrigendum 12 August at 14.29: The last corrected song, in which the deepest lakes of medium depth were wrong.
Iman's tax law: More stringent taxation of pensioners
The taxation of pensioners continues to be more intense than the taxation of employees.
The idol says that there was a mismatch under the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
This is not part of the government's proposal.
We believe that this should be absolutely the case.
The promises given should be maintained after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, income reductions were made for employees, which reduced taxation.
It warmed up the opposition’s representatives in the parliament, who swept the minister of finance Alexander Stubb (coc.) from the election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it doesn't grow
In the direction of tax reductions presented by the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.), I would like to say that it is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because the wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (Centre) and Orpo's wishes to respect the competitive agreement that has been achieved.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the strength of the social partners, so it should not be disturbed by questioning.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much in the face of domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Long-term unemployment in rice
The idol appeals to the government to deal with long-term unemployment in a budgetary controversy, at least to stop its growth.
Long-term unemployed were around 17,000 more in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective is to escape from the increase in employment rates to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: Not known for Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died in bombings of Finnish time.
The Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the guidelines of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists to withdraw their journey because of explosions in Thailand, but the ambassade's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In Thailand very few Finnish people
According to Westphalia, there are currently very few Finnish people in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel period is scheduled for year-on-year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finnish people in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target in particular the Finnish people in Hua Hin to obtain information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are away from the city at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be okay, Westphale says.
No data on the factor
According to Westphalher, there's no information yet about the attacker.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and to the constitution of a military junk last week's referendum.
The law was adopted by a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who reported their opposition to the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, Westphala says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, hits in the past have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today's a big, local celebration in Bangkok, Westphale says.
According to him, the city celebrates Queen's birthday and mother's day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
These attacks affect the day's course so that the authorities are very accurate on safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotase" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, reports the Thai police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
At the tourist destination of Finland, the holiday island Phuket at night exploded four bombs, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not demand deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded on Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
In the popular tourist destination in Hua Hini, according to the local authorities, four bombs have been blown up yesterday and today.
At least one of the two double bomb hits died.
In addition, in South Thailand, the village of Surat Than and the town of Trang exploded at least one bomb.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, because it transportes Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
Fighter not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, leader of the Thai military train, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are trying to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't let people panic more, he said to the journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told the Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place at tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finnish people to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas, as well as to follow the guidelines of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnishs to withdraw their journey to Thailand because of explosions, but the instructions of the embassy should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
In vulnerable Europeans
The attacks and victims that have occurred during Finland's night are known to date very little.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been allowed to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the vulnerable there are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded at the nearest end of the known watch tower.
Thai PBS tells me that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where they believe they have found another bomb.
Sad Than's bomb was hidden in the flower bench, according to the governor of the province.
At the strike, the local employee died.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that the Surat Than attack also used two bombs that exploded about half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won women's triumph
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second with 60.098 points and the Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for championships in Rio's races with perma, jump and tree.
Biles has mastered women's gymnastics to a degree in the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from three predecessors.
He has won the quadruple and permano championships three times in a row and a tree last and second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two team championships.
Biles have a better MM medals. They've got a jump and a tree.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Island has no effect on tourism"
The Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket and a child play club in the same property, has not been concerned about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, I do not believe that there will be anything more wonderable about this, estimates Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen many tragedies that have been experienced in Thailand near.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these former people have not banned tourists, this is hardly the same.
Huovila's office is located a few hundred metres from the explosion site.
Huovila heard a hit from his own employee.
The worker called around 9:00 a.m. local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the roads had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's party in Thailand.
Patong had a peaceful atmosphere and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10:00 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many hadn't even heard of the attacks.
Half a day in Thailand's time Patong had normalized traffic and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
On the basis of the strike site, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila, who went to the strike site, says.
Later this car was seen in the Kruunupy at Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was fired.
The patrol detected two men suitable for sensing marks hidden in a close cube.
Another man was caught right away.
The other one ran away, but later he was found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank the clues.
Research Director on Russia's Changes: Clear Removal
On Friday, the highest leadership change was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diploma, acting as Ivanov's second man.
The Canvasbreak says that the reason why Ivanov was dismissed may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way to prevent people from inheriting independent power from the president.
According to the canvas, it is also possible that Ivanov has been confused or misled with other leaders.
Position loss in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin, is moving to specific environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape by the state media, Putin said the change to a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace persecution,” Russia Today said.
The canvasbreak says that from the point of view of Ivanov it is a clear loss of position.
Environment and transport are not very important in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but the president was Dmitri Medvedev.
The canvas burst points out that the old map, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Older scientist Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Political Institute says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his neighborhood to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to Jarabulus city, so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabou.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the important city of Manbij.
However, it was estimated that tens of Jihadites were left in town then.
Corrected previous news at 19:30: Previously, we mistakenly told us that civilians were running out of town, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled out of town.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's documentary publication is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's guidance on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Vooti says to the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authorities' own guidelines, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to the Minister of the Interior to the evening-Sanoma.
The Minister justified the decision by means of instructions from the State Council Office and by the fact that the data had been recorded in the minister's calendar rather than in accounting material.
The head of the Ministry of Communications tells STT that the need to reform practices has been noticed at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt’s last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has been running against time under the championships.
From the beginning, he insulted his backwards and had to skip Jamaica’s Olympic bands.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better condition.
I've practiced well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - dressed sabbath dancers and fans.
Around Porina Bolt, the Jamaican star has risen in the time when the general sport has fought with the doping scandals and the sparkling interest.
Bolt’s previous loss in the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was exploded in the first 200 meters in the time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose exercise attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his prevalence began at a hundred meters, breaking the world record and the final celebration of competitors at 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career at the time of the legal point.
The world records born in Berlin are still in force at 9.58 feet (100 feet) and 19.19 times (200 feet) respectively.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is looking for 200 meters of world record and 19 seconds of understatement, but no one but Bolt himself believes in it.
At 100 Bolt, the most challenging is the 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin in Athens in 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing MM final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred centimeters.
Bolt hasn't lost any time in the final of the championships in Beijing, if it's only possible.
In Daego 2011 a hundred MM finals left Bolt without running because of the misleading departure.
Bolt will fill up over a week in 30.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's World Championships in London for the last goal line of the career.
These are the Olympics who fire me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm underneath, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Revelations from Rio: two athletes are suspected of a doping crime
According to the Chinese State News Office Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
A Chinese swimmer from Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was sent to your home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epohormone.
He was located in Rio for the fourth time in a butterfly swamp of 100 metres.
According to the Brazilian magazine Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case before the International Court of Appeal of Sport CAS.
Xinhua tells me that Xiny's sample on Sunday had found signs of hydrochlorothiazide diuretic.
There have also been other doping suspects in Rio.
BBC news that the Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epohormone.
Kenya, in turn, has sent home a general sports coach from Rio because of a doping crime.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK told us that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete at the test stage and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media data, this is Kenyan fast run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the Ferguson Rotich race pass 800 meters in the situation.
The puppy doesn't stop any of the historical gold came into the style of the show
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, was swimming in a 200-metre segment of his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the Olympic Gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' victory time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was placed in the sequencing second before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC's Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs at the evening interview.
Helen Skelton (Ok.) on Monday is the most read on the Iltalehd website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small amount in some or the British press of his revealing and special housing.
Television is a visual media, he's pressing.
Skelton has been dressed with high-tended shoes and a short dress, which certainly has at least enough visibility - in the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back-steps to be allowed.
It's important to look good, and the little squirrels are just funny.
I'm sure Skelton wants to swing, and maybe to use it as a matter of urgency, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're looking at sports here, and we're gonna have to have a phocus to be athletic.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the cavity has gone up to Finland?
I can't, but all that's paying attention to how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they do is ok to me, Skelton swells.
You know what?
It's an aggression from nowhere if it comes from dressing (drinker).
I'm a little fun if this thing's hit someone's radar.
The police of Rio made two arrests for terrorist suspicions.
The police of Rio announced on Thursday that they have arrested two people for suspicion of terrorism.

The Argentine lady strained the Beaver-Siren - the Finnish thought of protest
Wind Better-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Beater-Siren got tough on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady swept the Wind Beaver-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening day of women's surfing.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the crime.
He was stuck for the crash, and the others fled, Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
For a long time, the athlete considered a protest.
Then it was not worth doing it because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water so I could have gotten the compensation, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hanged on his board until the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, the Finn left at his 27th departure.
In the overall situation in London, the 2012 Olympichopeathalist is the eighth.
The calamity of the disease was not much affected.
Friday is an important day when we have a race for 10-12.
Edited 0.39: By way of the first knowledge, Beater-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, increase the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into the life of a person.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of the person so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that can not be affected by the person himself can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to mid-body acidity or to a social position.
Regular shopping can increase the age.
You don't even have to sneak up all the time. It's enough to get me a milk coffin.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest results of the research.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Beer and coffee drinks
Coffee drinks have been found to protect from some nuts, type 2 diabetes, and from Alzheimer and Parkinson disease.
Research at Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the "reduced risk of death", especially in the case of neurologists or cardiac diseases.
Again, research on alcohol suggests that reasonable use - from one dose to three days - could extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental wire can extend the life of a person for up to six years, says a study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
They can also contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The study in Norway explored the impact of laughing on human life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more dizzy than 35% more likely to be alive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexual diseases has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order to get additional years of his life, he should also get an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings additional years, it is not disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute cellularity.
For one research at Oxford University found that women with a large back had lower levels of cholesterol.
Their body also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study associated these factors with the mortality of the matt lamb.
Whether an athlete or Oscar won the Olympic medalists, he is more likely to live longer than a regular bottle.
Many researchers have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life for additional years.
Some researchers still suspect that long age is due to a person's social status, which, for example, makes it possible to seek confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
The study of shopping behaviour for people over 65 years of age found that a daily shopping person was likely to be less older than a purchaser.
This is due to the fact that operating in concrete trades reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may premature death.
So count your credit card from your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A deadly drunk ride pulled to the truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car sneaker happened at Koskea.
The accident occurred at Koske, Koskentien and Sorvastontien mid-Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that had received had driven on the same road, hitting the truck in the right corner.
After the collision, the truck stayed on the band, but burned.
The driver managed to turn the fire off himself.
The passenger car broke down the dike and then the door over the roof.
The woman born in 1972, who cared a passenger car, was left in pressure in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Central Hospital in Turku.
The result of a woman's blowing test was 2,02 percent.
He's suspected of a rough drunken ride.
The mail sent me some loose candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the K-Citymarket's free-success range, because the mail had accidentally delivered a part of the load to the Wall River.
The Teija Halt, who lives in the property, was buying loose candy from the Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign was hit in the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the loose parts because Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So, if you don't break in the lawn cut, the sign was in the sign.
The plate of the shop is linked to the fact that the Posti expanded its services last spring to also apply to lawn cutting.
Grass cutting is always available by Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly fun and he decided to share it in the social media.
I was hit by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Mr Haltia wonders.
On Friday night Haltia's update had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the Post Company Transport Services, regretted the damage to the evening-Sanoma.
The background is that three of the five scenes diverted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we no longer left to make part delivery (Saloon) at three, but we only took five scenes today, Kaidesoja told the evening-Sanoma.
It was the first news of the Night News.
Teija Halt was not angry with the sign because he found all of his own free candy favorites in the selection.

In spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds. Let's do it now with the project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he would finally want to get to normal weight, which was a journey of ten pounds.
During three months of exercise, five pounds were finally dropped.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in London: the memory of the victim for the police dogs
A week ago, the family of 42-year-old women murdered in London hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for the use of police dog work.
The Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update that conveys the family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had done his work as a replacement for Sipoo by the Veterinary Department and also carried out his nurse training there.
The veterinarian station remembers the words that touch a woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and unintimidated work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovian woman was murdered in her own garden in Loviisa Koskenkyl.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was very pet-loved.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a flour.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no connection.
There was a police dog Börje involved in the tracking of the murderer, who was injured in a situation of arrest at risk of death.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Justice issued a judgment to Post on infringement of the Equality Act
Post had no right to arrest the salary of the employee who refused to know the renter, assessed the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The Court of Justice imposed Post on the employee to pay most of the wages and €2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested the informant's salary for only a part that accounted for the part of the acquaintance of the entire day's work.
According to the Court of Justice, the employee had been placed in a more disadvantaged position, in violation of the Equality Act, on the basis of his trade union activity.
The worker had complied with the PAU decision on the prohibition of access to information.
During the November Postal Bill last year, PAU made a decision that Post's employees are not familiar with the offenders of the strike.
First of all, the news of the People.
Returning Turkey to a way that respects human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and human rights-respective development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in reply to the Journalistial Federation.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its earlier letter Sipila and Soin, the Journalist Union asked to express its concern for Turkey's freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini have repeatedly pointed out the importance of press and freedom of speech to Turkey.
Putin resigned the chief of his administration with Estonian persecution
The Russian president Vladimir Putin has dismissed the presidential head Sergei Ivanov, Kreml says.
The nephew of Karl Vaino, the Communist Director of the Council of Estonia, Anton Vaino.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news office reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kreml Bulletin, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inside, will move to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace persecution, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spying.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but I became President of Dmitri Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 prior to the re-election of Putin in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant purchase for a gambling ban - not seen in the opening of the Valioliga
The world recordman of football movements is not seen in the field when the English Valioliiga is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed with him to England.
Manchester United's giant purchase Paul Pogba is on the page because of the game ban when ManU opens his league against Bournemouth on Sunday,” said BBC on Friday.
According to the UK media, ManU paid the Italian carrier from Pogba to Juventus EUR 105 million.
However, the United Kingdom Football Association FA keeps him away from the game, because Pogballe remained a burden on Juventus.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it becomes a game ban for one game.
That ban on gambling has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is on the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is the virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival's position as an internationally appreciated event by the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival begins in Helsinki on Friday.
Typically, festivists have expressed themselves by dressing themselves.
One of the main artists of the stage is this year the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stabilized by artificial grass and art installation.
For us, it has never been enough that there would be just a main stage and a bargain, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Helsinki Suvilahde, has grown from a small card-lifestar to a tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the perpetrators themselves want to go to?
It's pretty abnormal to think this way in the production of events.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act according to official regulations, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end of this year.
The aim was to raise the number of visitors of 70,000 in the last year with 5,000.
Even this year, there are a number of interesting national and foreign artists at the festivals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because we need to finance things in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a flock of cattle controlled in huge corridors.
That's what we don't want.
Over the past 13 years, the successful event has led to an ideology that includes 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars in part of the artificial grass area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller slaves, 15,000 people are active as a playground this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be more simple.
Maybe I'm a little mad, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't ours anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to Kallio is that even today great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the 21st century, activities were very dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki for around EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow's operating company was approximately EUR 6 million.
It's a way to create "circles of things," like the construction of that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves by dressing themselves.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to be separated in the first place by content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of punk, 69 years old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rapper and soul-combining festival to be the most typical performer.
According to Kallio, Iggy was bobbed because now is probably the last time we see this in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what they call on a commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is fucking good and he's been doing damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower boxes. The tourists fled in horror.
In Hua Hin, local time was blown up on Thursday night by two bombs.
At least one local woman died and over 20 injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in the flower box and blown up with mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as the tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, said the police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia since 1989, made a very talky picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the game properly, you can look at it here.
Of the injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb was blown up at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time was blown up by two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded persons is not yet known.
Very soon after this, the popularity of the Finnish people on Phuket Island exploded two bombs.
No one knowingly died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was taken in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, in Trang City, one bomb exploded.
The police told me they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin that had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, it may also have criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been seized by criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new force will start fighting in a war situation
In an acute situation of war, warfare officers are only ordered after several months to fight for the swearing of a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnise, for example, 5.5 months of crew serving in a military situation, only those who are in the final stage of their training will be able to fight.
According to the Head of Education, reserves are first assigned to the preparedness forces.
None of the shipowners or reservoirs are ordered for a mission that has not received the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces are starting to train crews to the immediate capacity units from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during the training of the crew.
Pamela Tola got giant replacements from the home house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a severe dispute in the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trading price of the two-separation was EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, there was a serious problem of moisture in the house, which caused a dangerous growth in microbial life to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in decommissioning condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss of EUR 198 000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple brought the case to court and called for a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court.
The Court of Justice issued a judgment on Wednesday.
It maintained a court judgment ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47,344 for the trial and settlement costs of the couple.
The right to reasonably lower prices slightly because some of the housing repair needs had already been known to buyers when making the housing trade.
However, according to court law, the construction errors were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for good homes because they did not want to do repairs.
He had the idea that the building was basically repaired and in good condition and that there was no harm to the elements mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned as risks and malfunctions of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters flowing along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that it was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma left the idea that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be controlled slightly within a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013, the building identified microbial growth, according to the Witnesses, due to both rock rainwater and capillaryly rising landscape.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes was estimated by the inspector to also enter the interiors through the glacier.
A healthy risk-possible, limit-over-value cucumber or shredder was found in swept samples in the home care room, the cellar staircase, the living room window separator and the cellar wash room.
The terraces were built without permission
The Court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the city of Espoo's decision to make changes to the apartment prior to trading.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
Home problems were, however, a key issue in the court.
According to court law, the buyers could, on the basis of the information they received before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need in the near future for measuring repairs.
Tola and Waroma considered the court had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The purchasers have not failed to comply with their obligations, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Horrible archive: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children in the Nazis - also in the Finnish register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article Dagens Nyheter how in the US National Archive in Maryland there are microfilm documents for a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, as a Nazi bride at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-German Race Agency.
Heinrich Himmler was the SS Director of the Racial Agency.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to get children until he had studied a SS doctor.
The same applies to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate this issue.
The Race Agency investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in women's tribal tree.
Women should also be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give handwritten lifetimes to the Race Agency, as well as good recommendations from their closes.
The Race Agency wanted to ensure that women were "children-loved", "savings" and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not allowed to marry SS men.
The case does not tell how happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lifeborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that each SS husband should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lifeborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; the pages of the American Holocaust Museum are published.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for the acquisition of children.
The German mother’s tribute was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between the "arians" and the "non-arians" were prohibited by law, the museum pages are stated.
Betrayal Sire's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed third of the sailing at the first start of the Finnjolls day at the Rio Olympics, but remained as a peak of the whole crowd at the second departure of the day.
After five departures, the Nirkko rose in the overall situation, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14.
Wind Beaver-Siren fought the RS:X day in the departures of 17 and three places.
In the overall situation, the Beater-Siren is sixth.
In class 470 Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are at 19th place.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleeping sleep, "I was so cocky"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the Risteilyl ship to the 1995 tango kunka, Finland's best sold solo artist, and the star of the dance scenes and festivals, the Sillanhead is still able to pork and is at the moment in a gorgeous height.
Mari Koppise’s book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana on the life of a favourite singer was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells us about his life and career in both good and bad.
He won the crown of the tango king in the Wandäjoki Tango market in 1995.
At the race Sillanhead sang tans, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In 1995 in spring, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed for Sillanpää a man's request for a tango piece that Kassu Halonen fits in a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpää sang it to the tape in a terrible claw and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so cocky!
The bridge's in the book.
You can't imagine that it's singed in a crap right now.
Although I wasn't physically on my best, the trace was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand yourself perfect and peak.
Another man’s most popular song accident, which is reported in the book, occurred almost 20 years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from his partner at the time and the case ended in the final texts of the gold song, which was published single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sara Snakes were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanhead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the song that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the news of the 7 - day magazine.
In the news of Jar and his ex-beloved divorce, Jar was told about the excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said it was a full pussy, and it was not true.
Jari called the record when he was angry and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it... and good so.
In June the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of the voters supported the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, even though the polling week's opinions predicted the opposite.
The British economic and economic institutions were almost unanimously in the position to remain in the EU.
No acclaimed research institute or university was flagged for the separation, although a couple of individual researchers proved to disagree with the power of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign of Bill Clinton, former President of the United States, "It's the economy, stupid" flew to the Rompoop in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when they didn't hear their voice.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic Kihara
In his latest monthly question, Centre for Macroeconomics will provide responses from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economics were not listened because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economics for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed persons, which is almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also believe that the declining value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because economic unanimity was insufficient.
In particular, the fairness of the BBC, which gave just a few per cent of space to economic scientists representing the EU's economic disparity, as did the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling what opinion IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power books are about the consequences of the difference.
These far-reaching literary combinations talked facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if economists were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
Academies such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrants take your job, the immigrants rush your hospital, the immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments are a mess.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical time if they weren't?
Every school also has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the real British children be able to get out of school?
There are foreigners in every municipality.
How much more space would the first-age people have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and if they did, their answers were not visible.
The economists failed to explain that the UK has more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and especially European immigrants - are net public finances in the UK and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans for A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in the event that the result would be leave, the plan B, i.e. the win of the EU-funded camp, began to be more detailed.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid resources, but they could now be necessary.
We left to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid funds, Olden says Aberdeen's only open daily on a noteable basis of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to the old one, the normal rate would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds, Olden says all UK real estate funds open.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 per cent or even below it.
Thus, the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-funded camp won, Europe went confused.
However, the few two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Olderman.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, where he considered that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, freeze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to the years 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more peaceful, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to rotate, and the fund was forced to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash collected, but it was ultimately forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old one, they did not actually close trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the notification.
After that, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very peaceful for a couple of weeks, Olden says.
He points out that, for example, Aberdeen's Manner European Funds have not had any similar strain.
However, there were many questions.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old view was that the closure of real estate funds trade was disproportionate.
Open funds, which were closed, dominate about four per cent of the UK’s real estate.
Aberdeen's closure took six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Openiva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold up its fund for 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have fallen downwards, but the situation for Aberdeen does not seem to be "more fragile".
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, says Olderman.
The dollar and pound price is weakest for 30 years, and the market has a 15% discount on the Brexit vote period.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Olden says.
Brexit brought some reductions to the London real estate market
At 2:00 a.m. the situation didn't look so weird yet.
But at 4 p.m. when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the keyword.
I realized that this is going to plan B now, old man says in his other home in Helsinki.
He went to work right now.
London City was already alive in the morning.
The TV screens normally kept silent at the office would support the news, and usually loud people were completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera in the morning to tell me about their divorce.
When the market opened, the display ends shine out of red.
It was the morning that would never have believed to be alive, old man says.
Not because, despite the storm, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in the UK, finalised two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. as a robbery.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was kind of peaceful, Older says.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by the storm.
The red collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate heavy bills on the UK and, in particular, London real estate markets.
Up to 20% reductions were anticipated in London's office premises in the coming years.
Soon a group of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the dough has fallen down, but in the air there is still uncertainty.
It does not, however, appear to be the last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on the face of the Old One.
He still thinks it is far too early to say much about what Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of London's real estate markets has already received initial information.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, says Oldman.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and in only five months there have been worse figures, says Olden.
All the equal drops reached the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the US real estate market with the global economic crisis.
The old believes that the comparison is not quite correct, because it is now a British crisis.
There's another atmosphere, too.
The real estate market has now not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Olden.
We'll find money normally, too.
The repair business could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a miracle of him, that could have been before him without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world first towns have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, Olden says.
So the drop started very high.
London's prices have shrinked up for four reasons, Old List.
The British economy has grown sharply, and the population in London has also grown.
The second major trend is that the properties are the last ownership class that globalizes, Olden says.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination identified as a city.
In addition, prices have been raised at a low rate of interest, which has led, for example, to the need for pension companies to look for profits from new destinations.
The loan has been readily available on this - although the old has now been used much less than in the period before the crisis in 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price rises settled last summer, Olden says.
Aberdeen also started to reduce his property in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it came.
What's going on from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Olden.
He doesn't dare to assess much, but he says that there's hardly anything to say.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even way ahead.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down, since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he's an optimist who believes that the holes will be survived by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much victim.
If it's decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Olden says.
Group S starts registering shopping information more detailed than before
The S Group soon knows what you eat, because today the trade group told me to start collecting more detailed information about the purchases of its parent customers.
Once information has so far been collected from the final amount of the invoice, the group begins to extract it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S group follows here Kesko, because the data purchased by a plus-sagar card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to Ismo Riitala, K-Plus Ltd’s CEO, the feedback from the programme was mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the customer's consent and are used for marketing with permission.
The most effective channel is an e-mail.
A fairly few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to the House.
He says that Kesko is not going to react to the S-group registration change.
Kesko already ranks its parent customers in ten groups according to just food shops.
Classifications shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified by number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a parent client program and does not have any such program planned for this item.
Finland's Near Trade has its own 1st-bonus customer program, which can be associated with in Valintal, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We are not currently collecting information on product or product group levels, we remain at the final level of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and I do the day, as well as the client's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level of K or S, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
He said that the stock client programme would continue to be reformed, but the Near trade will be informed later.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of product information to be reduced.
First of all, experiment
SOK's customer and customer register has so far been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data included also the profession, education, housing, childbirth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The S card purchase has been deposited on the date and time of purchase, location, total purchases and payment method.
In addition, the S-bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismois, Kodin Terroes and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at the product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely, says SOK's client owner and partner business manager Marjaana Saarikoski.
S Group says he's informing his clients about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing.
However, the data is stored on the boxes in any case, wanted it or not.
The willing person can check the stored information on the S Group website.
For example, the bags do not have access to the information, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppet is Customs' latest dog enhancement - the puppet becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labradorian puppie snuffs five similar boxes in the row of countries at Helsinki Airport.
It won't go far when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila playing it with that favorite toy.
From the box next to Heila, a bottle of scented hulls were revealed.
Ruth gas is the first smell that Heila has now practiced, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online access
Heila is the first dog specialised in the search for weapons and explosives in Tull and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Work tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing sites and ports, as well.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures in Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Customs Superintendent.
The second access to the training of a gun and explosive dog to the duties of Customs is posting through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail shipments are carried annually through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the customs duty at Helsinki Airport has made a discovery of some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, including the purchases, luggage and air cargo of online machines.
Heila will work across Helsinki-Vantaat.
It's going to look into registered luggage and mail.
Its ports will be a great benefit in the future when it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is very hopeful about the idea.
School in Church Number
The training of Heila-pennun is coordinated by Tull's dog school located at Kirkkonumm.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and in defence expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
The hospital will always be further trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the six drug dogs of Tull and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labradorian Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The criteria for selecting a dog that complains of the airport include ribbon and hunting suite, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close working mate for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nothing without Heila to get home, Suntio laughs.
Fine orders go to Heila from the one-stop ladder.
The evening messaging cameraman will lose a camera miki's protection to a fast dog, but Heila will return a soft toy's protection immediately from the "remove" command.
Heavy competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, assessing whether training is sufficient for the required tasks.
Heila can be seen at work at Helsinki Airport next year half, if everything goes according to the plans.
Sadly, passengers can't come to slice the work bars on a dog, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog for customs duties is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, and then they are retired for care of their owners.
The working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active employment rates can only last from ten minutes to two hours.
As the owner of working dogs, there is a tough competition in Customs.
As the owner of Heila, about 20-30 employees were applied for by Tull.
Happiness hit Suntion, who hasn't had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance tasks at Customs.
The Mini State received its first Olympic medal, and the people will have a day off.
Fewer than a million inhabitants of the Fiji Olympic Gold in rugby are so highly appreciated that the government has appointed the 22nd August National Day.
According to the terrestrial broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the matter after the championship had been resolved.
The day of the day of the team's day will be held on the day after the team's return.
There are also celebrities in their country of origin for the sanctuary.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was followed by a final in the capital of Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only the Nazis of Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants the game was watched, I heard them encourage, said the Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish swinger fainted after a gorgeous performance
The pressman Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight of 175 pounds.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the riots, he has been dizzy many times.
No one's been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 pounds from the push and 145 pounds from the temptation.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 pounds, as did one another.
In the third company, the weights were raised by the scratch.
The body trembled under the weights until the court accepted the lifting.
The Finnish buyer's joy was expressed by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS purchased an Estonian attacker Prosan - Wraith League - Night Messages
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting contract with the Estonian attacker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for a leading player in our team who has works and whose threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over ten players.
Little silence from the crowd began to be distinguished as a good option Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen told in the newsletter.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, a depositary, where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemeeters meet the dominant Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became a need for a new attacker when last season's painter King Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family Star again: Teen Star Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, a friend of Alex Dunphyna of the Modern Family comedy series, will explode again by presenting his threatening body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in Minishorts, which do not leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also this back.
Recently, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by transforming its style and use into much more courageous.
The star has posed in the pictures she has published in the social media in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing very tight housing.
Winter on the threshold of adulthood has recently also published several pictures of itself.
If you can't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Previously this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV Amy Palmer doubted that Winter was in the process of having a "typical Hollywood form change" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more look at the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series, only 11 years old.
The actor has threw some of his long-term fans into his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where she will be in ten years when downhill is already so hard now, says a woman in Winter's Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women's fans defend the actress and urge them not to care about criticism.
You look great!
It doesn't matter what the others say.
You're an inspiration for many women, a tiny young woman.
Japaners prefer to go to Finland - tourists are attracted by renovation: In autumn it is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start renovation in the beginning, says Visit Finland in the newsletter.
The main destinations for Japanese renovation are Inari and Levi.
The renovation fires are our winter travel cards, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snow landscapes.
Lapland’s winter renovation flights have a high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the renovation season begins from early autumn and continues far to spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the reverse fires making the vision twice a coincidence, reports Visit Finland’s CEO Anne Lind.
The main target group of the Visit Finland renovation campaign is wealthy women aged 25-35, and Japanese women living in the city, dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, through online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights in Finland, and this renovation line has a huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays for Japanese travellers have increased significantly more in other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than double than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland as a target group for tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
Great Britain is satisfied with rugby hope in leading a championship course organized by Fid
The impressive progress of the UK in the rugby tournament collapsed in the last challenge of Fidz in the Thursday night final when the team experienced 43-7 breakdowns in the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a championship course in the process, bites, crowds, support games, running lines and sides when he won their first Olympic medal.
The kill was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver amalgamation, the third day of the British day, and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic rugby start tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Previously, the hard 7-5 victory of the semi-final played on the same day in South Africa could bother them in the final.
But in spite of this, Fidi would have won a 15-person team in this condition.
Great Britain, perhaps - but probably not - can comfort the fact that tomorrow at least one British has a gold medal on his neck: the head coach of Fid is Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.
It's been a great trip to the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, when they were trained by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adela's tournament.
Here they lost only one.
It hurts, but the development is awkward.
Fidi started excellently fighting British tactiles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams, this was as if they were running towards moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau diving in the corner of the goal area.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal shot.
12-0, and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's great roof stopped the male mountain of Leone Nakarawa's third goal, but it was only slow for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made a painting in the right corner, and Britain was 17-0 losing.
Nakarawa made another painting from the new start, and the clock was still over a minute... the first half of the time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou fell through the British found taclas and ran to the line to make a goal.
After the target hit, the situation at the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain only taught the game.
And that's what it really is.
The United Kingdom made a break of changes that blocked Fid's dam... for four minutes, which was good compared to the first half of the time until Josua Tuisova made a painting after the Fid's impressive feeding game.
Dan Norton caught the UK paint when making a touchdown in the left corner and decaying the situation in numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders whose supporters sang, whispered tickets and danced in the viewers.
It was difficult not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame last minute had a coat in Fid's cake, which did not need the coat.
It was dedicated, the Fidji hauled and the Great Britain fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
Previously the same day, Fidi had beaten the Japan semi-final 20-5, and the UK won South Africa in a tight semi-final where both made one goal - the British goal shot solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's leadership in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the target area with a shiny footwork and painted under the groundballs in the second half of the time.
A great late take from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony's 15-side Rugby team in England, secured the victory and finally the silver amalgam.
Trainer's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to the robbery win
These races will not have more than feelings of gold, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard fights towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they roamed alone, there were three voices on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when two of them challenged their second consecutive Olympic Gold at the women's couple competition - the first women in the history books of British sports, which are overwhelming to such a achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also record.
This is what we see, two great athletes connecting on the surface with a swan with a thinness, not entirely picture the nature of the victory.
In the background of each rodent gold there is a group of helpful hand pairs who gradually promote the things that are relevant, and no hand pair was as important as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live until now.
As he said, the situation was sharp.
I had urinary bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your way of thinking.
Williams got a diagnosis in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky that his treatment was able to start outside the early 2014 period, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get a pay, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Pulling yourself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple of thoughts was Williams, who had had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more commonly trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the royal gun regiment of the Afghan command, said, "I've been a classroom this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much for me."
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard Helen and Robin have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he has great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition for five years.
A couple set a hard rhythm that their competitors didn't overwhelm.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the warehouse.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen shouted "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we're just trying to win a good robbery and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years are waiting for us to decide on their future.
Glover will be attending the wedding next month when he gets married to Steve Backshall, a TV adventurer.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say that this would be my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland exchanges the government of Panama's leaks
In October, Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which are called for by the excitement of Panama's information leaks already in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians have evaded taxes through tax paradises.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the minds.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analyses, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s last spring anger affects the election result of autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear degree of criticism of the rulers, and God Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S. Republicans, revoked his last swings.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of Isis and the Democrat candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was upset with speeches and asked for apology from Trump.
As Chief of the Army, you should never let anyone go down like this, Clinton's chat.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a cover-up burkini-sweeping dress by Muslims, says British Guardian, among others.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that all those who do not have a good practice and a secular bathing suit are prohibited to go to the beaches and to swim.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of disturbances in order in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July 85 people died and hundreds of them were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to celebrate the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists who were connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulun area passed through the screen in the lake of the dish
Water samples taken from official bathing sites in the ova region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only the Pyykösjärvi beach has been observed with bluetongue.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public coasts.
With the exception of the seaside, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and intestinal enterocococic bacteria were below the operating limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococ in the seaweed bathing area were established on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations were lower than the operating limits.
The blue-leavened seam at the seaside of the lake does not yet make water unreasonable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-leavened flower, making the water surface of blue-green leavened boards.
Environmental action follows the situation with intensified checks.
If the bluetongue turns into bluetongue, this is also reported separately on the bathing area notification table.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkaraine of Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 % of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one tax change in the next year's budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance.
The income levy proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of a gift tax for generational change in forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a forest grant reduction has four objectives: to promote generation change in forest holdings, to younger forest owners' age structure, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of the forestry sector.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool to promote generation change in forest holdings is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Manager of the Agricultural and Forestry Producers Central Union (MTK).
However, the hacker finds critical in the tax change statement.
A forest gift reduction is presented for the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
The MTK and Hakkaraise believe that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could directly result in the sales income of the wood.
The VM's proposal is based on the fact that a reduction in the pure capital income of the forest economy prevents the loss of the capital income of the forest economy, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would have a tax advantage, even if no tree was sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to characterize it, Hakkarinen says.
In addition, he said that the model concerned only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit imposed on the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled up too high for Hakkaraise.
In such a way, he believes that 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are removed from the area of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners' community, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the limit ensures the aim of increasing the volume.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been brought to Hakkaraise for decades.
Its background is the ageing of the forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of forest owners are retired.
The powerful crawler surprised the drivers at Himanga, two cars sneaked out and hit each other.
There was a special trail in Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutively run cars were cut off in the fence, after which the rearing came after.
According to a friend's firemaster Harri Pyyhti, the demolition is suspected to be due to a strong rocket wall.
There were two people in the car that was driven back to the hospital.
There's no more information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometers to Kalajo.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results by researchers at Turku University can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings of the akademic professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissues, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by returning the cancer-based tissue to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of medicines for cancer may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in treatment.
Research results have been published on 4 August in the rated Nature Communications magazine in the field of cellubiology.
The tree of the family home sun continues in the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The tree of the family home sun continues in court with respect to both convicts.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family homes in Muhokse.
One received 8 months of murder and brutal robbery as a young person, among other things.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and brutal robbery as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced to a serious threat to road safety as a young person and to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The judgement of the Court of Justice was complained by the prosecutor, the shareholders and the man who received a harder judgment.
The Attorney-General calls for a lesser sentence to be convicted of the murder of a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
At the time of action, they were in full understanding
According to court law, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked in July last year as director of the Child Protection Unit.
The 17-year-old of the murder sentence, according to the reasoning of the judgment, attacked the director sitting on the living room couch.
The director had been able to get rid of the extraction and put a young person in his room, when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The conductor was also strangled, beaten and kicked into the head, among other things.
According to the state of mind, at the time of the act, both convicts were fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the day before.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, growing only at the age of 156
As the world's longest living spine, a verified ice shark has been found, reports the research published in the Science magazine.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark or holker can live up to 400 years old.
The female increases only at the age of 156.
I've been stuck for a lifetime. It only grows a centimeter per year.
Only one species of mushroom is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
The scientists found out the age with a radiocarbon limitation.
As a result of nuclear experiments in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
They made it possible for researchers to assess the age of the sharks.
Forever, 392 years were estimated, although the throw in the direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenues would be missed if the change in corporate tax made by Donald Trump was carried out.
Tax revenues were also reduced, particularly as a result of the most profitable tax relief.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
I don't think it would be a huge sum, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39.6, after the reduction made by Trump 33.
You'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump blamed the State for overregulating the business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards adopted for emergencies must be re-established and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's health reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is the main cause of US problems.
The free trade agreements would be dismissed.
For imports from China, a penalty rate of 45% and 35% would be imposed on Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our religion, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control seas, American steel to lift new clouds across the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - even those close to the Republicans - are seeing the Trump programme bring the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday, Finland's time.
The wave of attack from the past - People's News
The sea is devastating, but the real wave of attack is hit in the middle of Madrid's streets. The account with the past can begin.
It merged the core of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's news.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travellers (2013) was a little fun and scrupulous satirical comedy, the pre-season skin where I live (2011) at the tops of my Spanish career.
Even Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is a harmonious love, relationship and family drama with a relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is a spark and we'll be seen as a long back.
Life seems to be a model for the middle age name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can always be wondered to the end of the movie.
In the form of a backdrop and a long letter, Julieta once the stages of her life for her adult daughter.
He begins from time before the daughter's birth, from the moments when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, a young teacher of Julieta, is rising to the other female main part, a TV-accounted series of Ommelte time (2013-2014).
The ageing of Julieta has been dealt with in a way that can be seen as a kitchen, but I would say that it's a bit scrupulously and verbally with a single wipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance from Julieta to the unique humor.
It is a fairly playful, controlled, place containing good music and a rather sad movie with elements for elegance.
Instead, the typical visual color aperture for the Spanish director is maintained and it begins to inject in a little quiet eye more as a pure shape aspect than as a dramatic means of action.
There are diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses of the film, but the surface remains one Korean.
This applies in particular to dressing: in the case of a name person, the dwellings vary from seizure to seizure, and the same applies to apparent replacements.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the swings of each scene, does not improve this more specifically.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has made the manuscript of literature based on three novels by the Canadian Alice Munro awarded Nobel in 2013.
The Novels have been published in the Work of the Escape: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a little equate literary filming.
The essence would have been emotionally undeniable to even more drastic, the great things - especially the clay guilt - are dealing with the thematics of the movie.
Guide and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Mainly Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's first night is 12 August.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts are being made, the sparkling ministers, so that the Finnish basics are not completely collapsed.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out as a robbery.
There will be no new surgery.
The already decided four billion savings are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) are convincing under the budgetary constraints.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the World Cup proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's supplement, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of the unemployment benefit is reduced by 500 days to 400.
Training surgery is continuing.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
Why are ministers so squeezingly stressing that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipalities will be held in April and they are the most important fever meter during the parliamentary term, not the gallows.
It has already been seen that the various communal results of government parties will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallups say that the Finnish government party expects a smoke loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest compared to the parliamentary elections 12.3 per cent.
The Basic Finns received 752 new delegates four years ago, many of which will be realized in the next spring by the price of the influence of the right government.
The life of the government of about three of the same large parties is dependent on the enduring of the Finnish base.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters of the party have already been tired of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's membership have also come to the surface.
Firstly, the rethoria of the new cuts will not obscure the fact that next year it will be done roughly and secondly, it will be attempted to soften the anticipated attack on the Finnish people.
Large cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything is probably different if the government of Sipila is still standing.
The government has set the goal of indebtedness during this parliamentary period, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take € 5.9 billion next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the town halls, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt will not be tightened or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This means new even more severe cuts on the previous ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be spent at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring it will receive what is going on in Parliament elections.
Indebtedness of these actions
It is absolutely clear that the current actions are not going to be indebted, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to blow up a positive atmosphere.
The curricula presented by the State Secretary Martti Hetemäen's budget consciously testify to it unwarrantedly:
The global economy's growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimal, i.e. no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen recently since the collapse of 2008 except in the period of the revitalisation policy that took place temporarily at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been extended by an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current public debt flows, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
The indebtedness imposed by the Left Union in spring 2015 was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will practically be covered by a completely new debt.
This is the understanding of the center, the assembly and the basic Finnishs of what is responsible.
Question: People want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three of the four believes that the organization of day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the research of the KAKS Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people will also be responsible for the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civil schools, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The province's responsibility is more clearly sought by county guarantee, specialised health care, vocational education, higher education and institutional care for disabled people in development.
There is no wish to delegate any of the tasks of the municipalities under the responsibility of order.
The underage drunk runs out of the achterdistance after the police escaped.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist ran a police patrol away in Joensu on Friday night at half a time.
The police team tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to run the police at a fair speed.
The back-up continued to the Sonkajan Coast, from which the Sorronahon and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After this, the young man ran away from the run, but the faster-footed police ran away from the escaper.
The driver's blowing test showed 0.75 percent.
He also had no driver's license which would have allowed him to drive on a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock barn fell down in the dike.
The lorry in the rockbar fell in the lake of Polvi on the Cavation on Thursday night at 9.15 p.m.
The truck had drove out of the road on the left wing and fell on its side.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver from the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first nurses.
The vehicle was taken up by the owner of the car.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil was absorbed by the rescue facility.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Old woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in the Lahden Village in the South of the North.
The police are looking for about 165 centimeters of a woman with white hair underneath the jaw.
The findings and indications of the missing movements are requested to call the Centre’s point of reference 0295440513.
Materials of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery about the destruction of Parafest
The crash flow of the Parafest festival tents caused massive destruction.
The President of the Joensuu Parafest Association Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival will be financially accessible, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared at the end of Friday night on the marketplace.
On Saturday, the programme will continue at 1 p.m. at the premises of the city theatre.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15 a.m.
The programme will be organized as planned.
The pulse flow occurs in the cloud when the rainwater and its weight start the downstream air flow.
Changes in the conditions of the Ucco Cloud water bind heat and thus the lower air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
It is reported from the Institute that crash flows occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of pulse flows.
The pulse flow hit the Joeensuu Museum of Art in the backyard on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four persons were slightly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for further treatment.
Air pollution obsessing Londoners
According to the study, London's skin is getting older faster than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The UK research reports on Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retired Londoners’ skin is two and a half years older than that of a rural fellow.
Small particles older than the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, where almost 9,500 Londoners die every year according to Evening Standard.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their work trips near the bushed streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleansing.
The tractor's brakes betrayed the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his garden with a tractor.
When he had risen out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor’s brakes were deceived and the tractor swept on the man.
However, the man did not fall under it, but the tractor was pushing the man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital to further investigations seriously injured.
The tractor had no time to go beyond the light, because it struck the stones ahead.
Nothing in the New Powers for the Future Period

Through Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. Country Team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all the MM games in the gym since 2003.
Now, the sixth race is going in Tampere, only in 2013 failed to be better in the North American quarries after Canada was better.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was setting up a salibandy country team.
I was interested and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York in Elizabeth City.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen got to Joensu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensu, that kind of species was not yet played at SM level like a salibandy.
The band was played at the university.
I played basketball in the Kataja and later in the Jokiboys in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played in the company of the University in the SM series of salibandy in the period 1991-92, the following three went through in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the company's A girls for the championship.
Women's SM series career grew up to silver in 1995.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasu circle closes to Kouvola - SM-gold missing from awards
As a beach volley player, Essi Hasu is about to quit after at least a temporary period.
Beach volley The Finnish championships will be decided at the Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in the series of both adults and young people.
In collaboration with the SM final tournament organised by the Kouvola Flyballers and the Finnish Flyball Association, the six best pairs of each series of rankings will be awarded.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's raised by Essi Hasu, who has been among the beach volley summits in Finland for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully, as many as possible will be able to get to the lobby this weekend.
I'm sure we're coming to the laundry stadium as a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu feels.
Kouvola's area burned Hasu's rock into sports and gave a good meal for a great hobby.
It's a good thing to remember about childhood.
When I was 9 years old, I started a ball in the E-girls of Elimeen NMKY.
The main thing in mind is a too big game shirt, spinning knee guards in the necks, as well as great ass screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports career was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the work of the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasi beach volley was already a junior species choice for indoor ball.
On the shore of the river, songs have already been played in the 1990s.
It's always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Anniina Parkkise, a SM-finals.
The goal of the second sentenced twin in the tournament is clear after the Riikka Lehtose and Taru Lahti.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-bear we still lack from the prize dog, Hasu throws ridiculously.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasu's acquainted audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil society are awaiting.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
By the way, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Salomon Koli courageously became a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk takings, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started shortly two years ago, together with her little brother, Valentine Kol, as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Mark Koli, helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant indebtedness and an increase in the volume so that bread could be handed out of agriculture.
This has been my thing since the little boy.
I've always been happy in the farm, and now that I started myself as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a garden water, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it.
However, I myself really bravely joined the project and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells and adds that if he had not believed in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even larger cars.
The work has produced results, because Solomon Koli has been selected for the top ten in the competition of the young food producer in the Rural Future magazine.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months

The average annual inflation measured by the cost of living index over the last 12 months was -0.8% (August 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living in July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (in July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.

The "anime" effect of Snapchat is judged as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime has acted as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens platform, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to edit reality and play with identities that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are simple, face-driven tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All the misleading steps will quickly end up in public documents.
The Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized with the impression that the application advertises blackface or black face mask or prefers bleaching skin color as a beauty glove.
So when Snapchat advertised this week to some users a lens that gave them the wings of eyes, wings of teeth and bottled cheeks, some critics called it racist caricatures of Asian people - "yellow face" or yellow face.
And they wondered if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the larger problem of the company in terms of diversity.
The news and disguise spread widely on Wednesday with the reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said that he had ceased.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be a tribute to the anime characters, not a caricature of the Asians.
But to observers experienced in racism, the lens was a reminder of injurious stereotypes in action.
Others strongly banned anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose twits of photographs were widely distributed, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it's difficult to claim against a comparison with the next-side gross Asian carnivore and filter efficiency".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, it is a yellow face that is carried to extreme calamity.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in an infinite struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse youth audience can mean that they are even more likely to expect a comprehensible attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's birds creates an insulting image, "it is much more difficult for these guys to be unnoticed."
Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to the Medium and in his telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mainly white men's leadership and decided his writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Whether they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colours in their staff, so they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have different skin colour representatives at work, but they are not in places where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not provide public figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private undertaking.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the race of his staff, but according to the representative, the company hired a recruit some time ago to focus on underrepresented populations and to move on internal integration efforts.
For Zhu's part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed and added: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this isn't okay."
According to the Congress Panel, military officials distorted Isis information
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress panel said that the US military headquarters had prepared intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against Isaiah than was justified by the events on the ground.
The sub-annual report of the working group set up by the Head of the Republican Committee on Defence, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Defense appropriations identified "a broad discontent" among the intelligence analysts of the headquarters, who said that the heads of the United States were disturbing their efforts to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as the Centcom, is a military headquarters in Florida Tampas, which supervises US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of inquiries accepted by senior managers of Centcom typically gave a more positive picture of US anti-terrorist efforts than the facts on the ground justified, and were regularly more positive than the analysis produced by other intelligence actors," the press release said.
"Centcom's events are impossible to accept - our fighters are suffering during the war when bad analyses are presented to high-quality decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, the Republican of California.
The failures in Centcom's management are just up to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the regular problems in the descriptions and analyses of the headquarters of the United States of America's efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high administrative authorities of Obama's administration had ordered reports to be tampered, it indicates that the analysts felt that the leaders of Centcom would have put pressure on them to describe the more positive threat posed by the Islamic State, Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony to the Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," said the report.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that the major attack to take over Mosul could start even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in his possession.
"After months of investigation this is very clear," said the representative Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officers at the US military headquarters manipulated the results of the intelligence of the headquarters to mitigate the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that the analyses had expressed concern that intelligence information about the Islamic State was manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow broader results when the investigation is underway.
The Superintendent of the Ministry of Defense has initiated an additional investigation into the investigation of the Centcom.
On Thursday, the Democrats of the Enquiry Committee of the House of Representatives published their own findings that were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican working group.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unforgettable process for the intelligence assessment of Isis and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the leading democracy of the Committee.
According to the ship, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence results", weakened the mood among analysts, and "was not giving enough space for different perspectives".
The ship and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to press the analysts of Centcom to reconcile their conclusion with "pre-established or political relay".
The Daily Beast reports on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Superintendent has initiated an investigation after the Centcom analytics complaints.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation of the Superintendent is underway.
But he said that "experts disagreed between the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences than the question of whether the US bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (such as the growing number of defence authorities is now claiming).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can trust in delivering honest assessments of the war operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
The criticism of the Islamic state's intelligence reflects the dispute over a decade ago, when the intelligence analyst of Centcom, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the opposition of several analysts, President George W. Bush's government supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the revolt regarding the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, the expressions against the Israeli state-controlled refineries had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September, however, that this finding was not reported outside the headquarters.
The commander of Centcom's bridges, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an overpopular assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a women's hockey by organising an interim investigation with Britain
The day after making three goals for the team in the win of Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made on Thursday for the U.S. women's ground hockey team two first goals for the Americans in the win of India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said that was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the person who keeps a record of his landmark."
But he knows this: the Americans are in the 4-0 Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan's 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have survived quarterly, and this game determines who will be the first and who the second in their six teams.
The first one will avoid a strong Dutch leader, the second group leader, a little longer at the beginning of the quarterly finals.
Whatever the Saturday game ends, the Americans have raised up with their surprising success here, four years after they left at the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up the ground hockey box for the first time at the age of 3 (he was the twin sister who played the species at Drexel) in connection with the country team at the age of 16 when he became the youngest player of that age.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his teammates.
Next year, the English Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same working speed in London as we have now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half-time painting with a razor shot near the painting.
India had come to the game in the air of any win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation in the 1-0 number until the end of the third batch, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left of the field to put, then turned in the middle and crossed the ball to the goal, taking the Americans into the 2-0 leadership.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth batch in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first United States goalkeeper to Jackie Briggs, who had reached one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
Bam, too.
"We now have a good situation," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the game Saturday.
Trampolin peace in the midst of the Olympic War
No matter where you are, no matter what the time is, the Olympics are running.
The Rio de Janeiro events seem to be a continuous and inevitable, annoying message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic game itself is a flaming messenger that is sent from a sniper to a swimmer and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read the newspaper or listen to a guestman's conversation in the café line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time and future heartbreaker of the Olympics, with his smileheads, could well be one of the names of all who are presented for the best time of viewing and who support sponsorship agreements and good mind TV ads if he was a swimmer, a sportsman or even a swordman.
But Dooley, 28, from California Lake Forest, competes for Olympic gold in trampoline.
The Olympic game does not illuminate all species as much.
Far from the centre, partly in the shadow, are the species that are not all generally accepted: air gunshot, flex shooting, ball ball, taekwondo.
We've always got a chest, for a long time it's alive.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special preferences, I would like to draw attention to the temptation of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it made its first performance at the Sydney Games, its presence in the past 16 years has been so low that many of the interviews did not realize it was an Olympic species at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won the medal in it, and its athlete did not progress until the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share women's medals for men, Chinese and Canadian.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan defend their London gold gauge.
Trampolin, however, is associated with the attraction of a certain type of subject, partly because it sounds more appropriate to an uncivilised ear to the clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an incompetent fan.
The species have opportunities for fun, as shown in the colouring of the endless pubs in drawing films, but also the smoothness of exercise and swimming jump, two species that in principle combine.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish word or trampolín, which means a pushing plane.
The championship seekers jump up to almost 30 feet in a gigantic trampoline, and they have to carry out buzzing series of business (turns, skills and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be evaluated on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flying time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight forward.
The people who wish for Italy have to go to gold looking for more, faster, up and over - sometimes up to the goal, sometimes backwards around the field.
They're not just hunting the goal line or the initial wall, but they're also, in television news collection, another blatant limit: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatic, and it can even get a viewer's tears.
But that is also why looking at the races can be a little tired.
Trampolin is offering a moment of rest for this.
Trampolin's up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to the new rise, appearing to be weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not lack competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no anger towards the end, no jumps to distance, only a dreamy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen space as you can get in the Olympics.
Women's karing competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at the beginning of the show at 1 pm (ET), men's races will also come on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software from 2 p.m. on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, attractive moment that is probably not noticeable in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to stare and object (such as the US male pros proposed some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his subtle new fanship.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a long-term American ally
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
Political change in Ethiopia has been confronted with the violent opposition of the government.
The eyewitnesses say that tens of protesters have been shot to death in meetings with the police.
Is Ethiopia going to break?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the strongest countries in Africa, a strong federal of the West, whose economy grows rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Only last week thousands of people ran into the streets demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was unpleasant.
The eyewitnesses said that the police shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
The videos that are recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be in the last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities are hitting young people on their feet while they were forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The United Nations General Human Rights Authority is now calling for thorough research.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will continue to be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, who is the project leader of the African Corner in the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most violent country in Africa, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country gets so much help in the Western countries.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Abeba is even a new train for business travellers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly talked about the oppression of the government, the opposition has been limited, and the other thinkers have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the land, captured, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you oppress people and they have no choice but to show their mind, this will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole young man shows his mind.
One generation shows its mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the powers of the coalition that dominate the use of land.
After the much criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last position of the opposition, and now it holds all the seats of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions at the frontier against Eritrea are growing, and the battle on this tense and controversial frontier took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past few years, can try to exploit the spoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why the bitter feelings are now exploding after years of drowning under the surface.
The first one seems to be pretty dangerous: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and internet services have improved.
Although the government would shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location through the hidden network mediators.
Many young Ethiopians said that they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the anxiety and amhara, are better able to work together.
Anxiety and amhara aren't natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, which come mainly from Ethiopia’s Christian highlands, succeeded in politics and business, using orphans, many of which are Muslims and live in aways.
But this is changing, too.
"We're on our way towards organization under one umbrella," said the oro manager Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amhara and anxiety believe that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the Tiger people. The people cover about 6% of the population and control armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenaw's loss.
Meles, former Director of Rebellion, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly competent to detect early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents harmless.
"The current government does not have such a basic feeling," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desaleg, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who came from the North Ethiopian tiger area, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigers don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
For the last time Ethiopia was in the power of such an outrage in 2005, when thousands showed their views on elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been the first time that the government smuggled and then robbed them.
Many demonstrators died, though less than in the last few months, following an effective attack, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new work trip train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the strengthening of the rejection of the Ethiopian government.
And now it begins to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, the amhara city in Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the demonstrations put the United States and the other Western allies in a foolish position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to Somalia, although some time ago it said it had closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want to complete the collapse of their instability allies in the region.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balance."
Donald Trump explains Obama-based Daddy's claim to be "serious"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his last campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he this week repeatedly indulged that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders of the Islamic State terrorist group".
The investigation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have overwhelmed him to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position where they must explain comments that he does not necessarily mean.
After the suggestion made at the campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump said the same thing more and more enthusiastic in the interviews on Thursday, where he said that his purpose was to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
However, in the early Friday morning Twitter publication Trump said that he was only sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation of the previous day when Trump said that he had been seriously accused of several interviews.
When Conservative Radio Runner Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpi make his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican president candidate took this to his hearing ears.
The last storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has sought to re-focus its campaign in the midst of economic opinion research results.
Trump and Clinton fought when they talked about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Again on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, after he faced a wide-ranging criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remarks by saying "I am sarcastic of course".
The approach enables Trump to visit the borders of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then 'clears' in the direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the use of both candidates' language.
But I also think that he is envious about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of lessening its speeches for the general public, Trump has been more stubborn in recent days when his popularity has continued to fall.
The new, Friday published NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey showed that Trump is following Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump, as a rule, seeks to avoid apologies for the provocative things he has said, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
When he has been confronted with an ever closer examination of the presidential campaign over the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to the uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his comments are.
New York's former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most outstanding supporters, made a lot of effort in defending the candidate at the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real political comments in his words," Giuliani said when he was asked about the truth of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, completely wrong, and that was why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans of the power are trying to claim that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to manage the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before the meetings in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which shout every word and are neutral against him.
He ridiculed "wrong, pathetic" television experts who tried to find out about him, saying, "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump's excuse for a new evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a disturbed, just a cash-acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, Bedford Avenue's street arm became too expensive for it.
The business that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals saddd it as the last loss in a city that was rehearsed in the middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is broken and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also re-inventing.
The revived Verb opened at Greenpoint last November, under a mile away from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and can be paid by credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unfinished atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verbi is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb used the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
There are cheese sandwiches on the menu, for example, with capricus and brushed onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the cafe, but there's fresh juice.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed the old parent customers of the steady stream.
"Williamsburg also became too expensive to many former customers," he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she walked into the cafeteria.
He says, after Verb closed, he gave up for a while for a coffee drink.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a common coffee instead of a mixed chai drink, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before working and always made the same order.
"Every day, fifteen more than seven, regular as clock, I went in and they were preparing my spices with butter," he said.
Photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still makes his regular order, but sometimes because of the variation he has space for a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hate the soap shop that took over the old farms.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered Verb to prepare special juice, which would be used as an ingredient in cold-extracted coffee in the café.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the cafeteria.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it out soon to some point to make his new neighbor feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juicy place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafeteria will extend to the departing building.
Many customers have enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a parent client and said he was unconsolated when the place was closed.
When a new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home when he walked inside and ordered a coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depressing food during the Depression
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office room.
President Roosevelt liked refined five-avenue foods, such as the goose-maker, and Maryland's turtles.
That day his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce and dessert from bone muffin.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," Jane Ziegelman said.
His husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights is food historians.
Coe’s last book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life in Lower East Side’s storey through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest cooperation, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the great depression of the 1930s.
By showing their own culinary solidarity, they meet the journalist at the Ironberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unfinished lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been operating since the stock exchange break in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato seed and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered a meat roast, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the depression period.
"The muffins were very popular," Steineman said.
There was peanut gum, liver gum, peanut gum.
They were made from a fabric and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual fabric.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make your dinner.
Coe irvisti.
"It must have felt like a fat of lead in the stomach," he said.
Years before the depression at the American tables, especially in the countryside, was like eating-nine-a lot-like-jaxat-nout table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to Europeans starving during the First World War. The A Square Meal book crowned the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a country of abundance.
"That food became a central, annoying topic for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same afflicting was a new, cheap diet: Mysterious fish, such as mosquitoes and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use food stares," said Steingelma, because the cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been in the middle of American meals for years, became a richly dosed luxury product.
Different compositions were tested with a higher amount of calories and nutrition than taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
In making a study for a recipe book, Ziegelman also made a seasonal food where cooked onions were filled with peanuts.
"It was not a popular addition to dinner," Coe said.
The briquema specified, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter doesn't fit for strawberries.
This was characteristic for many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Agency in 1923-1943, controlled the country’s eating practices more than ever before or after.
In newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and respond to the challenge of converting spaget and carrot-like cabins into tasty doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical tasty pieces.
Particularly tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoover lets me eat your cake attitude.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood for a simple, iowan food, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
"He liked continental food, like fish with throat sauce," Coe said.
He ate a smoke on his head in the almost golden dining room.
He was awesome out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example in his own stomach.
As stated in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested in taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered the most ugly food in Washington, but also the worst cooked food."
Many of the laman - time foods were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our continuing concentration in calories and nutrition, says Ziegelman, and in the way how science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they reached a better understanding of the meals of the mother of Ziegelman, for example, of how she could not throw food away.
"He really was afraid to waste food," Coe said.
"He even sicked people."
There was a windmill incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert that they had prepared at home: the snowprint food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a bone marrow," Zegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give modest recipes a name.
There was no cream wax in the dessert, just bones, some flour, sugar, water and cane.
All of them fell into an unwillingly stiff, brown limb.
And suddenly it wasn't bad.
Coe's got it once and another.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of broken German nuts could help."
Gilead will be replaced by lawyers in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S. fiancée has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc. to be entitled to receive legal costs incurred by it in the case of hepatitis C in dispute against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from the $200 million payments after they had violated the two Merck patents associated with Gilead’s success medicines to Sovald and Harvon. This exemption followed when the US judge found Merck’s abuses, including false oaths and other immoral practices.
In the judgment delivered on Thursday, US judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to be free from the compensation it received in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market in a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can significantly improve over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case runs until 2013, when Gilead and Merck brought each other to trial the active substance of the medicines of Gilead for the ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of sofosbuvir.
The U.S. forces say that they have completely ruled Manbij by Isis.
The U.S. forces have taken over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group's representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of warriors hiding into the city left.
The forces had released more than 2,000 sealed prisoners, whom the fighters considered prisoners, Sharfan Darwish SDF's allies, Manbij's Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we have begun to study it," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax declaration, which showed that the income of the Democrats' presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax percentage was 34.2 per cent.
In 2015 Clinton donated a million dollars to charitable organizations, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton earned almost 5.3 million dollars of spokesperson compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million Publishers from his book, Simon & Schuster, who reported his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine Virginia, and her wife Anne Holton published 10 years of tax returns.
Their real federal tax percentage in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a benchmark for economic transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in the opinion.
As a strong contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises of publishing his tax declarations.
As usual, US presidential candidates will publish their tax declarations, even though the law does not enforce it.
The New York businessman Trump and lawyers have appealed to the Board of Directors for their refusal to disclose tax declarations.
"You are your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when publishing a link to the democracy candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, the Special Assistant of Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trumpi’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and numerous other links, for example, to Russia.
Clinton has tackled the problem of publishing a web video on Friday, which brought out visible Republicans who urge Trumpi to publish their taxes.
On Thursday he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate for the past decades has done: published his tax declaration," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax percentages have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported the rule named by billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that the earners of more than a million dollars per year would pay at least 30% of their taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska Omah last week, Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway Conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr Buffett said that he also has an audit of the tax administration, and that Trump is not "frightened" the tax collection agency, but the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax percentage of Clintons living in New York Chappaqua was approximately 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax percentage was about 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their principal investment was a cheap, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported dividend and interest revenues of $ 109 000.

Chile powder condoms and rays enhance the protection of Tanzania's elephants
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking in people's inhabitant areas - they throw animals with chilla powder-filled condoms.
The way has proved to be effective, and several years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has stepped up its advertising by educating volunteers in northern Tanzania to use unviolable four steps to protect homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we have developed the tools, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Honeyguide's CEO Damian Bell in the opinion.
The first two steps contain the display of an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and the play of the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, throw the so-called "chilipilvi".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chilli powder and soil and with a radius, then the condom is folded so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts and blows chili dust into the air.
One fragrance is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last means are the trigger that shoots into the air of the Roman candle, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes a Berlin hotel that removed Israel's heading number at the request of the Arabs
The French filmmaker in the Jewish background came into power after the media storm revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's headline number. According to the employee, this is because of the "requests of Arab customers".
The Shoah documentary film of the Holocaust, Claude Lanzmann, rebuilt his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent night stay, Lanzmann tried to find a list of country destinations provided by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you could call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own telephone centre.
In looking for an explanation, the filmmaker talked about it at the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer that he received from there was "upset."
The hotel's receptor said that it was "the thoughtful decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's direction number," the employee says Lanzmann.
Israel's German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great iniquity", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked by the case.
It's a great iniquity in itself.
But even more shame is the fact that this happened in Germany and this hotel chain.
This doesn't need any explanations.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident produced a pretty counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply gave up the claims of Arab customers.
The second publication noted that the hotel on the beautiful Kurfurstendamm street stands close to the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly challenged all charges and called the thing "inaccuracy" and "apologize" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel report.
"The blind order not to include Israel in the Quick Choice Chamber was never made", said Kempinski's representative, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students in mind
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian Sao Paulo city, when students met to show their views on government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to dismantle the student crowd, leading to the use of rubber ammunition and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their fear of plans.
According to the proposals made by Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of the State of Sao Paolo, less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffits against President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last demonstration took place only days after the protesters moved on as one group to support President Dilma Rousseffi who was arrested during the vote of the Senate of the country on his accusation.
RT business: trade between Russia and Iran is growing sudden 71%
Since the removal of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
After the removal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown great interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to market.
"Naturally, one of the main objectives of bilateral cooperation in Iran is the expansion of trade," said Dzhagoryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to 2015, resulting in a total of US$ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent, totalling $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 per cent to $18,8 million.
"The growth of trade was achieved by delivering machines, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is waiting this year for a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran granted approximately 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens for mainly travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries, most tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, fairly few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which has preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotti Callum Skinner jumped to the finish when the British caught the bike gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner honored the men's teamprint at the Rio cycling stadium last night when the British team triangle defended its championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague, Sir Chris Roy, renovated, and the legend was proud of a young man when he cried into the goal of the pre-recommendation of the win of the snapper from the team of New Zealand.
The UK took the chess victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his sixth Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after being modestly placed for the sixth March Rail Championships in London, although Hoy has since decided to compete.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of special ambassador Jamie Staff.
This could have been done right in time when Hindes appeared.
The end of Hoy also created the vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man on whom British coaches held up in Scotland with potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British triangle won a duplication of gold.
After his own round, Hindes was very much behind, but Kenny pulled the team, and Skinner held it up.
The change in strategy was a major part of the change in form, and it included Hindes' drive at a larger time, so that he would slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention when they entered the award award.
23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made a final Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable at once.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after the bad start.
He later withdraws his comments and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British tickets on the foot."
As a team, we found a connection over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so wining the Olympics again is simply awesome.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven of the ten cycles in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be waiting for the success of five days in the cycling stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's goodness, it is absolutely impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's tribute, the win of three Olympic golds in one Olympic.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (evidably on the holy day of British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday), would raise the total number of medals to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete for the next sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoyed this one now.
The team competition is always the best.
It's going to be won together with the friends.
Winning alone is, honestly, lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two goldmilitas, he should be given the value of the knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were in time the fastest four-person, four-kilometre team drive.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 world record of gold in London is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time when officials invited him to a length measurement.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in the world record time at the time of the clock stopping 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great road bike team will take over the middle of the Olympics and reach the entire range of medals.
After presenting a truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio races.
The background has been a drama, of which the least have not been the difference between the technical leader Shane Sutton in April because of sexualism and temptations, and the end of the race of great people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, with the initial support for the first-night cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of the United Kingdom now to rise to its peak at the perfect moment could be once again true.
Portland's mergerless future - questionable due to the cut of the electricity contract
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminium sludge and hundreds of workers' jobs is uncertain when the electricity-distributing company to the factory revealed that one of the owners of the factory is about to terminate the distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution agreements will be cut.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian administration that the aid required to maintain the plant will not be continued.
The support for the 20-year period ends in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk in the Alcoa Portland factory.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelt uses about 10 per cent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's sulphur, which last year led to the closure of the Anglese power plant.
Alcoan Portland's merger loses money and is under threat of closure.
The measure has now been following several years of speculation from the future of the factory, which began from the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the production price of the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to the large aluminium smelt of its Loy Yang An power plant located in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to conclude their agreement.
Most of the factory is owned by Alco and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects Portland to continue its operations, which means that the physical need for electricity will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month period of termination, so they will actually end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects the contract to produce results in the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All possible impact on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards is currently constraining the strong prospects of the wholesale electricity market.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in advance.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the smelt in operation or to secure the smeltless power supply".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
Analysts have been alert both to the portland sulphur in Victoria and to the potential closure of the factory near Newcastle, because the economic situation in the sector is a flaw.
Previously on the week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
"If both factories leave the market, it is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
For us as a producer of electricity this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the real TV star of the Kardashian, is on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter of the clan, is on the cover of the desired US Vogue September number.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and was a model in the fashion weeks of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"To look at this deck in a room full of beloved people, made me cry," Kendall wrote.
Cancer locking followed by a unique (or perhaps only fits in the Kardashian style?), a manuscripted reality video where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and associated with all the favorite entertainment, the Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but ended up in the classical translation: they planned a surprise party.
It's a cliché pattern for almost every child's " birthday period" television series (Seacrest says the turnwords "you probably didn't think we would forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn suitcase), but Kris had to get other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendal's grand sister Kim may have brought Vogue's complaint first (he shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is his own class.
Vogue's September number is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles the coffee protocol more than the fashion bill, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832 pages of last year was advertising content).
The revelation of the deck star is so much expected that for the last two years the pictures of the magazine have been leaking before the official publication.
Previous women on the cover have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more "publics who act as models" than "models that are famous".
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were in charge in 2013, year after Lady Gagan's place of honour.
But if it happens that Jenner, the magazine describes his generation as a "success model", would hit the first category mentioned, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not famous people's relatives or reality stars or today's young people who can do a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year, with Lemonade's publication, Beyoncella has been one of the strongest years of her career.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
In his real TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be bad.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadidi, calling them "this moment a bitch".
This feeling got up again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But rotating in discontent is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on Vogue's September number.
He's a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their apps found behind the wall of payment.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took to the LOVE magazine.
And in free time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a real TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people out every year
More than 160 000 most vulnerable people will be removed from the Community legal centres every year when the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its activities already at the outer borders.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, who have no opportunity to fight unfair marriages and similar - are already turned away in search of legal advice and representation.
Legal services already brought to the outer borders of the Community are being prepared for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centres of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away each year from the essential services they need," he said.
People who go out of violent relationships with uncontrolled and disgraceable debts, families in separation, unjustly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected residents of Queensland have to navigate in the middle of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to examine the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the government of Palaszczuk should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged to court after the employee was claimed to be threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged to the court that they did nothing after they were told that the head of the campaign in North Carolina threatened with a gun to work in February when they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in a complaint brought by Vincent Bordin, former software practitioner of the State campaign on Wednesday, Charlotte, before the State Court.
Bordini said he was waiting for months to deal with the situation internally before he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "released the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knees," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had the same experience as Phillip, it was said in the complaint.
"No weapons need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate was angry when he told the audience in North Carolina that "the people of the second addition" - which usually includes arms owners and armorists - could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton was complained and had to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has removed his word from the context and that he does not support violence.
The challenge of Bordin is to seek compensation from the campaign for unreasonable control and for violence, abuse and emotional shock from Phillip.
Trump's representative, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
Trying to reach Phillip didn't work.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote reported Phillip has recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consulting company for Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
The campaign of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.

Britain has to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing in the whole stomach, not just in local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London races, when we saw a huge effort to make sure that all our people and regions benefited from the races.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only local communities will create 10,000 new training places and 40,000 new jobs and eliminate youth unemployment around the airport.
Like before the 2012 London races, some will think that the challenge of Heathrow enlargement is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the races, and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project for many, not only for few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the heritage of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment during the time and budget: T5, which has been voted as the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2 built between the two most pressing routes in the world.
Now the team is ready to run a third runway, which supports 16 billion pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that Heathrow's extension is also that.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and to expand Heathrow, to ensure the future of our trade and to create the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and mouse game on preventing advertising
For companies who receive money for online advertising, companies to miss the ad prevention program are "cat and mouse play", said one of the companies preparing such a program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer websites, Adblock Plus published a blog writing saying that users can update the program filters to prevent advertising again on the social network websites.
On Tuesday Facebook said that its website code will be exchanged around advertisements so that advertisers would be more difficult to detect which parts of the website are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's been running a new code.
In the blog writing, Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "the like-to-back fight between the open source advertising community and its turners has been in progress since the invention of advertising prevention", and that it is possible that Facebook will soon find its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has played a part in the fight is a strong indication of the great tragedy that the advertisers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, around 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported last year in Pagefair and Adobe's research. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and the mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company is after the advertisers of the websites used on a computer, because mobile advertisers do not operate on Facebook mobile applications for the social network or Instagram, said the representative.
Computer advertising still brings enough revenue to make it worth investing in this kind of operation.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said that it would update its "advertising" tool to give people more power about how advertisements are targeted at them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also prevent part of the website from advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to tackle the problem," Facebook's representative said in the e-mail opinion.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, so instead of them we have focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She was under the car on the Swiss motorway apparently due to suicide.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman stayed under a number of vehicles on the motorway in the early hours of Thursday in a case that apparently was suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges'ta Vaud canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman made a "desperate act" and settled in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, the Vaud police said in the statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been interrogated, but not all have yet been identified, said the police who appeals to them and to all witnessed witnesses of the incident.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
"But stay to see if anyone of the involved drivers is charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to be resolved," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - where both had a person walking on the dark motorway - it was estimated that the drivers could not expect to meet the pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year, the police were released from the charges in respect of the deaths caused by failure after he hit and killed a man who lay on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and out of the way, the court was told.
The Court found that the police who were responding to the emergency call were in a justified manner, and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the case near Morges on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had to be inhabited once
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabited once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies research centre developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could sometimes have a soil - like atmosphere with hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide filled.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow speed of Venus explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and still could have been running slowly.
The model also looked at the early Venus surface formation.
The planet probably had dryer areas, but there was once enough water and geographical variations to enable life and to protect from rapid evaporation of water.
The advantage of Early Venus was also 30 per cent lower than the sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained GISS's researcher Anthony Del Genio in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer, which acts as a shadow protecting the surface from the warmth of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth.
The model produced a story from Venus’ development stages, similar to what planetary researchers had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be inhabited at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours burned in ultraviolet light.
When the hydrogen escaped, it left only a thick carbon dioxide air with the killing greenhouse gas phenomena of Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy will give up the coach of Avalanche.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the work of Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice-chairman of hockey, saying that there was no impact on the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President/General Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team started looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have committed my duty as Deputy Director General of Ice-Skill Affairs in Colorado Avalanche and as Senior Trainer with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in the opinion.
During the summer I have been thinking very hard about how to improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the opinion of the coach and the Deputy Director-General on ice hockey issues should be fully in line with the opinion of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach of the League during his first avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and to the middle division victory, but Minnesota dropped Colorado's dropover games in the first round, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
The Avalanche games in the period 2015-16 ended 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 matches, and the team lost in five points to Wild, losing the wild card slot of the Western Conference.
Hall of Famee's chosen goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to negotiate and delay the strike
The North Sea oil workers' labour struggles for pay will be postponed when all parties to the dispute are sitting down for a new round of negotiations, said the leading negotiators.
Lacks against the Wood Group service company in the oil field have been organised on a random basis with North Sea drilling cars led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the process to resolve the current dispute," the joint opinion reads.
During the next few weeks, we will hold several meetings throughout the day from early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the professional associations, their recent labour struggle, which they say is the first for more than 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30%, wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors' fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's premium reduction follows a 10% decrease in contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that the additional cuts would give the company the necessary flexibility to cope with the declining market ratio.
Shell, in turn, has reduced thousands of people from its paylists and announced its plans to leave oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, when the company reduces its activities as a result of its abandonment with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the June decision of the UK to leave the European Union.
Mr Anderson, the Scottish Member of Parliament, met the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one generation of major North Sea labour disputes.
He said the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, not only for few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the opinion.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler Measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Stars
The last mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of the speeds of the stars of the Plejad Stars.
The new information helps astronomers understand why the stars of the crowd are rotating at varying speeds, as well as how the circulators are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star forces, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of the sun," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at Pasadena Centre, in the press release of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis.
Plejadie's star team is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're running at the top level now.
At the top speed of the bike, these adult stars are sinking large amounts from the wind of the stars.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star gets older, it's slowing down.
Kepler measures the speed of spinning each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sun spots.
The latest list of speeds of the stars suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars with dancers who make the devils slower than those smaller.
"In the "balet" we see that slow wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejadie Stars are so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for the assessment of the stars' properties at speeds of rotation.
"Plejades star group offers an anchor to rotate stars in theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their speed and so-called hang their 'Danish field' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejade's speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the astronomical journal.
