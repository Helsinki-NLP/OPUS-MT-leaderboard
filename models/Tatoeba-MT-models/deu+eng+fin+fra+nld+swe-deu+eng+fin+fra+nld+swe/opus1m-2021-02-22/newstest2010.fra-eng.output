Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, to spend 26 hours and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be given to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a loaded program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will know its sum in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American president to receive her, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee's own area.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the award was awarded.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this award by being a President who is conducting a war in two countries at present.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasise.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of 10 million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charity works, but he has not yet made a concrete decision which.
His program will then take him as well as his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned having the feeling not to deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as he.
As soon as the announcement was announced, he said that it would be a "invitation to act".
A defender of nature accused of extortion
The Litometric Police accused the President of the Litometric Society of Protectors of the Nature.
At several times last year he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his call, said Alena Romová, spokesman of the Litoomics police.
The president of the Litomřice Nature Protector Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of up to three years of imprisonment.
Waste sorting bennes are not in the perfume in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort his drink packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on tri bennes at each corner of the street.
What about Brno?
Here, you should take several minutes before you find the appropriate bennes.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city of the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the age of stone of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but above all because of the number of bennes dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city center?
It is a whole science, which presupposes time and steel nerves.
The only place I have found for now is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to do this, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention that in other neighborhoods of the city, it is not a sinus either.
So, in the end, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
By paresthesia.
It makes them a trolley to get to the bennes.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to throw some glass and PVC bottles.
Except I didn't see any Kounicova Street colored beet.
Fortunately, I found the appropriate place by taking the tram.
This said, the waste was overflowing.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, isn't it?!
It is probably that ecology and alleged aesthetics are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy a first hockey league place in the city that embarrasss the city all over the country, instead of buying some additional bennes and proposing the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after having been on the internet for a while.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget removed pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may be lacking money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on the debt of the State or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just resolving the problems later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It is important to know that on the money borrowed the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The State really has no choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has currently increased: firefighters, instructors, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and must not be afraid of their pensions or sickness insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year there will be no missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will thus grow faster and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The State will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and initiated sections, and it is not possible to amend projects to possibly reduce costs.
At least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major yards, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed that the financial deficit be solved very adequately - it will result in the dividends of the ČEZ (electric energy supplier and distributor) which the State mainly possesses and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that in no case it is a well without a background.
Last year, 18 billion have been navigated from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of environmental damage, to supplement pensions accounts, or to serve as a reserve for preparing pensions reform.
Moreover, this hint increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and crime, or even housing savings, has decreased by nearly three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway," says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the department side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of a hundred million dollars of the two-billion project of State cash, which must allow for online monitoring of the expenditures of each administration.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place," said Janota.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that allows the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
Projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this opportunity that is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can differentiate them into both staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti from the VMware company in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not notice any of the fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is growing.
The VMware company is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains disrupts hoteliers
Desert tracks are no problem only for the slope operators.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their ski trips in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits to our site.
Internet users go through the offers, ask for prices, but don't dare commit themselves to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to pass the New Year of your dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, you better not hesitate to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait for a few more days.
Špindler hoteliers currently offer only one week stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try another time to place them, but they're going to hand over them too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours de Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is most interesting for us at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared a few cheaper last minute Christmas trips," said Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks cover up during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert says.
On the other hand, the occupancy of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn★kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of Poles and February also sells well," says Karel Rada, director of Pec's best hotel.
Hotel Omnia near the central parking area of Jánské Lázně is also complete to eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the latest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have 60 per cent of occupation at present.
February is a little weaker for the moment, but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly still grow, said the Omnia Hotel Director, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be fresher and if there is rainfall, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the time is expected to warm up, informs Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
He even became comic, the insistence with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered as simple.
When he finally let his doctrine transpire so hardly expected, it turned out that he had copied it with carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of the Bush Speech in January 2007 as the title of his own Speech: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to Iraq consumed by civil war as "unresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely success to such a extent that newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan the miracle will replicate
It was again the Campaign Commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President has hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he has cheated on at least 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in extinguishing the promise of additional 5,000 on the part of Europe, even if he had 10,000 at the outset.
What brings the most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be its intention to withdraw the armed forces from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruit as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricid wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - no one can count on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to changing their leadership day by day according to their arrangements.
The political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain in the eye of the powder behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity in relation to reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "swift state of action", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes it confused by its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently at the edge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the war's tumult for their "return to home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible as the Taliban will consider it as the indirect awareness of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' will to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem by using military force.
For example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of the Afghan troops.
However, each solution of this type will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to build on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank leaders will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking senior employees from the US Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to the strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to sell before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from leaders if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus stands at the forefront of the efforts to link remuneration with long-term performance to Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that needs to be taken, said the former Douglas Elliott investment banker of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after putting almost $17 billion off for premiums for the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to the Reuters Agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the high premiums from the banking sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
On Wednesday, the UK announced that it intends to apply a single tax of 50 per cent to the bonuses of bankers over 25 000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all areas except physical
They are five women, a record number, who today received the Nobel Prizes from King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave in technical disciplines and literature in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the Romanian original German writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Medical Prize for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Economie Award, American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award has been awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomic glasses.
Each winner received the Nobel Medal, the Nobel Award Award Certificate.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kronor in each category. (about €1.1 million)
If one of them contains several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The highly awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to US President Barack Obama.
He, in his speech, recognized the controversial nature of his reward as he was only at the beginning of his course and was also the leader of a country engaged in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of his policy he added that in certain situations war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay to the government because of his disagreement with the State budget for next year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position at the office will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
In his view, the deficit is too large, which further undermines the crisis in public finances.
It was the Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of SEK 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, on Wednesday, the House of Deputies validated the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government blamed the Socialists' proposals for their indirect increase in the budget deficit.
For this reason, there was a violent disagreement between the left, on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, which questioned the future of Fischer's firm, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
The critics claim that the budget, as voted by the Members of Parliament, eliminates the package of savings measures taken by the Government of Fischer, which, in its view, must enforce the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not require it, today, at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, said that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unreasonable deficiencies" of public finances.
In his view, there is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement if it could rely on a consensus of wider political parties, according to the President.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget was scary and that the government should challenge its future existence.
The Vice President of the ODS Petr Nečas said to the ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Ji★ Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is scary and will exceed 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, ČSSD identified the ratification of the State budget as a success for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new movie of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus - Invincu film will expose the world a lot about the country, its fights and its victorys.
History speaks of sport, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor awarded the Oscars, embodies the film about Nelson Mandela's life, an infatigable fighter against the apartheid racist regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a 90-year-old Mandela who asked him to embodie him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to embodie you, I should be able to see you personally..
The 60-year-old actor who was rewarded for his role in the Milion Dollar Baby Drama in Clint Eastwood, located in the middle of the boxing, has, for example, incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery itself, a fictive President of the United States, or even God in the film Evan All-Power but never anyone alive and as important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African State man was detained for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is an invincible Latin word and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true history of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world rank.
The South African team will finally make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to a large screen.
I had no other purpose otherwise to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in the couch before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to grab his hand.
I realized that when I grab your hand, I recover your energy, it transmits, and I felt like I knew how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pieranor, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare himself for a role in the hard middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pieraner at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I ringed at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pieruner was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus, under the leadership of the director Eastwood, received positive opinions and even was talked about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy from the Daily Variety newspaper summarized her assessment in the following words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only recognized yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected impact on the successful test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it damaged itself in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" like "missile that doesn't steal"
A missile that does not steal but shine
This 13th test was normally started at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there were damages on the equipment again.
It was obviously the third-floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was navigating under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired by a moving and immersed boat
That's why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
By the way, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The two first floors of the rocket resisted and the damage only touched the third.
In previous cases, engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the trial launches had taken place without an aggression, the Department of Defence's leadership considered that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This rate of success of almost fifty percent thus takes the generals of optimism and they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even take ten hypersonic nuclear kernels with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetissov will be presenting himself again in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend hand-held to his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will probably enter at the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details about the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and obtained 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous Quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and one of those with the greatest success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he scored gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also earned the tribute in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Temple since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the trade unions and canceled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared an emergency strike on Monday.
The speaker Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday working again this year.
We can't abandon our production plan, it's essential, that's why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech kronor to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded postériori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the surcharge for the additional hours, or they can make a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-year holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and warm point in the comments and claims of the trade unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost two overtime hours on a daily basis in addition to their eight hours.
The trade unions intend to cancel the status of strike after the agreement has been signed.
The next negotiation between the direction of the automotive plant and the trade unions should take place on Friday afternoon.
On Wednesday, the union director Petr Kuchař stated that they were ready to stop the status of strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously striked because of continuous overtime.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wage and alleged bias.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for the production of cars.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the trade unions also requested that employees who had ceased production be subjected to no sanction.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a rebate of about 5,000 SEK (209) for these.
The Hyundai in Nošovice car factory currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovered: a substance that also works on "endurant" HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists test new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed drug immunity.
This is, in some cases, about the fact that the combination does not work as intensively on the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the life of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of medicines that prevent the propagation of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication results in the development of the so-called resistant viruses on which the medicines no longer have effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are a combination of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all medicines used so far and that's why they could overcome the resistance problem.
Researchers' work leads them to discover new "améliorated" substances based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their viral protein bindings.
Metalocarborans have a unique tridimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
HIV protein is a HIV virus protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, mature infectious particles of the virus would not be born.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped," explains the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is subsequently systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in samples as well as on resistant variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common version of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, but it does not decrease on the resistant versions against which the common medicinal products are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to be explored further in order to develop effective HIV medicines, says Pavlína Ελλάδαová, Director of the Laboratory of Structureal Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute about the budget. ODS takes action at Fischer, who defends himself
The President of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question his existence.
The Prime Minister described the statements of the ODS as a drastic verdict.
He says it takes some time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative firm supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer worked.
According to Nečas, the Head of Government should decide whether he supports the House of Deputies on the minority that is concerned to combat the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in his duties with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of ODS and social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits were diametrally opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday with, however, proposals for amendments of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish as what an amended budget is a less bad variant than an internal budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatens to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota met with the Prime Minister on Monday after his arrival in the government:
He indicated at the same time that he was wondering whether he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment with regard to the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case with the head of the Government of Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have not done anything detrimental," said Topolánek in a text release from the United States.
He recalled that the Deputy Ministers of some ministries were calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign against the fact that he is fighting the amount of the government deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority currently in the House."
In other words, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the democrats.
I have not thought about it, and once it is on the agenda, I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has taken a step back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not explicitly asked the democrats to allow the budget to be voted.
We don't feel orphans, we're not little children, did he respond to the question of whether the ODS had not been accused by the President of the Party to the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew at the time when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the next months would be a bolchevision of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new hours of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or restrict certain less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will, on the contrary, strengthen some other trains.
The total coverage of transport will decrease by two per cent from today on the day of entry into force of the new hours.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino rame.
On the contrary, an expression will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decline in transport is the Hradec Králové region of 8 per cent in total, whereas Prague and its surroundings may be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague line - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the largest transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electricalization of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague main station (Praha Hlavní nádra.).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will leave in two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13.
This year's invoice for regional railways: 200 million crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways in the next year in a total of four billion kronor to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion kronor next year, knowing that the State will participate in nearly three billion kronor.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was still one year.
The railroads appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase in the vast majority of transport titles.
The changes will affect only one day ČD Net tickets and internet tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without a discount card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiška will once again depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities of a chosen region and was at a single price of 160 kronor.
Filipino rebels always hold more than 50 people, children have been released
Today, the rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed about this, but it spoke about 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields when they fled to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the plunderers as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November in connection with the election of the governor's administration, there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested as a result of suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential line of Ampatuan.
The island of Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine Government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film from Clint Eastwood arrives in the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates a part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the world-famous apartheid returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the returns of critics and the audience are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Saharov Prize for His Freedom of Mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize next to Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup of Football, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by taking his own terms.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have been well prepared.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times in order to - as we say - recover his energy, he indicated at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual he added.
wear the rugby national team suit
The film based on the history of the novel of the British writer John Carlin's title is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his mandate to the Presidency.
Morgan Freeman therefore attempts during the film to recoup two race groups of a long-separated population and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he was clothed by the South African team's national suit on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won then.
To show up on the lawn in suit, which is considered to be something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had long been ionized mainly from the white public fourteen years ago and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into a single nation, said the Chester Williams rugby player, who was the only "Noir" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the trend in South Africa will improve.
South African whites, however, are skeptical as recently entrusted in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who fled to Great Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
In the morning, a fire sank a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution centre near the municipality of Vikov na Lounsku.
According to Luk★ Marvan, spokesperson of firemen in Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They were originally planning to let the processor consume themselves, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal shortcut of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesperson of the company Pavla Mandátova, the incident does not jeopardise the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to be a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is turned out.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps has not known anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Electric power supply has not been interrupted," said ČEZ spokesperson for North Bohemus So.a. Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transport sets to distribution sets and lines of a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will lodge a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefets
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will today file a complaint for defamation against three social democrats.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesa
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions concluded by signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claim that the fine mouths are made, while only one offer was made for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So it's all we have to do is defend us.
This is in exchange for calomnia on the Student Agency company, said Jančura at Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that there was evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the filing of Mr. Jančura's complaint represents the following of his media show that serves him as free advertising for his company and for his person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is just Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and liar arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the adverse approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he was planning to resume it after the New Year.
He explained that the campaign would be aimed at corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to assign to the Czech Railways the operation of railway lines for an order of approximately SEK 150 billion, without issuing tenders.
According to Jančura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jančura threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who it is but I don't say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will turn back old habits from January.
She will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against culminating pneumococcus.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance will pay.
The specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If the vaccination was started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations must be paid for themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for one dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 SEK each year in doses of vaccines.
However, they save on the medical care required by unvaccinated children.
To date, the State spent approximately 500 000 kronor per year for the entire vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the Janota package.
Pneumococs are the cause of middle ear inflammation but also serious infections including meninges inflammation and blood poisoning.
According to hospital investigations, up to 28 children under the age of 10 died from pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have at least imposed this.
I think this is a direction that needs to be followed now said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to alter the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are absolutely not considering it for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Srše.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Specialised Society for Paediatrics, recognizes that vaccination based on volunteering had its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum, I understand the decision making vaccination optional", however, says Cabrnochová.
The specialists predict that by next year, more than 80 per cent of the new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Pneumococcus vaccination is also a break in the fact that it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
However, this is linked to the concerns of paediatric practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to make the vaccines be purchased through insurance, and the doctors received them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members were concerned that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to refund them.
It is estimated that pediatrics will have to invest nearly 40,000 kronor per month in vaccines individually, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Vol"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical pellet to force the entrance of the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP quoted a police officer that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Mr. Frazetta Jr claimed that his father had been authorized to "come into the museum, by any means, to transport the tables in a storage facility", reported the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refused to grant such a permission, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in budgetary taxes.
Ministers defended the increase in taxes and the reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticisms of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories argued that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about the decline in the deficit by deferring his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals is a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The trade unions protested that low wages were punished by a recession which they were not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will be able to obtain about GBP 3 billion a year - has made the world of companies angry, because he says it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPLES OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% banker bonus tax
The increase in company profit tax for small companies has been abandoned
Taxes on electric cars and winds
Increased pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a winning person GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a winning person GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a winning person GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was "complex decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would account for the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was necessary.
"These figures are important and will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would begin again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed to which the deficit will be filled - have been questioned after the Chancellor had to revise his initial figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the pre-estimation.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign this Thursday warning Labour's "debt crisis", said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers did not succeed in presenting a credible plan on how to reimburse, did they add, "cynically" éliminating difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They did not present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary at the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour stresses that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals, which would result in a faster and more rapid reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said that the money collected through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, supporting that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC's political editor, said that the timetable for advertisements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April next, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor face charges of propaganda, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, theLabour stresses that additional assistance is provided while people are most in need of it and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
False budget
Although ministers did not publish expenditure details beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute of Fiscal Studies) stated that the figures of the Chancellor will in future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigation into "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the American Embassy in Pakistan, BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their homes in the U.S. State of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani ascension, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
If it were American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesman, said that the agency had been aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already under surveillance by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but she said that the United States had to "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been brought away from their home by their families, in North Virginia, at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abus"
In the past twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report said that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticism of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have argued that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and the prosecutors claim that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Teheran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protested against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate losing the elections, Mehdi Karroubi, stated that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured dead in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the Government's response, but it stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 persons had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent other events.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the Bristol site into a track for competitions.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the runway of the Brandon Hill Park, a small drummer preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, student in fourth year of medicine, said that the view of the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the shineing city downstairs.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best flight - or figures made on the track.
After the Thursday evening party, the snow will be abandoned to the ironing.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a lay state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French don't like the foul" (2006), an elegant and well documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much broader and more ambitious frame.
Good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very well able to listen to and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or the mayor (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
These practical problems, he says, are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the layness of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian so virulent of layness) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims were not ruined, compared to the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with the Lay Republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "shortness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that can't survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are navigating in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and the complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their lives by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old, who had to fight only the tip of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught while swimming next to their mother, just killed, were caught and sent into zoos and circus.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the sizes of a zoo are usually one millionth of the surface required for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae that pushed into its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Indians using powerful guns to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters most north of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, provides a clear and scary summary of Arctic science and a fascinating overview of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of changes.
It's not a matter of trying.
At the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth, the pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the glacier coat.
The underwaters of the Cold War then cartographed the relief changes under the Cold War.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the greatest of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson looks at the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the steaming water nets pressurised by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it's our turn."
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first class De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, made a seven-hour bus trip to place a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who one day were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the tombs of veterans in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Crones across America), which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagone, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and on the Memorial site for United Airlines' flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave over $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitouflated in several layers of hot clothes, volunteers walked between the lawns and extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples stood by the hand, wearing the fresh pine crowns on the grey tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly node on top.
Nearby, there was silence on Section 60, where most veterans of war in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Some people wept without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends stood in the cold air.
Some read loudly the names engraved in the stone while others fell to see the small black and white information cards, penetrated in the wet land for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many tearing mothers on her son's tomb.
She left Zanesfield, in Ohio, and had taken eight hours to come to the tomb of Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free of... my son paid for that, she said.
"For a long time after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the US Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "hazardous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but permissions have always been denied to him.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama government that pursues a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government advances in concrete steps, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can return the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year has the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day of wage.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in certain government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who often wish to connect must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few incarcerated Americans in Cuba are behind the bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press attaché to the US Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that would be authorized in any other open society -- free mobile phone distribution -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader in replacing Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, a accused is often arrested, sentenced and detained on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when both countries are starting to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified a supposed organization to prepare a conspiracy to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying that they hoped that this case would dismantle an important network of recruiters of terrorists who were evolving the Internet into the search for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them join the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, Al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of Al-Qaida that these men did not participate in the CIA's conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains from the northeast, becoming a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities that expressed itself on the condition of keeping anonymous due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to enter al-Qaida camps when arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI -- stresses the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining those who give confidence in them.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, United States secret services have been given priority to infiltrate men into the Al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spy.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups should also pay more attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept because the American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets here, Saturday, calling for greater action on the climate by the negotiators working in the Bella Convention Center Palace of the City.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 were estimated by the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists had started a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day, when little has happened during the United Nations-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists walked out of the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who stated that traveling to her mother's native country, Peru, opened her eyes on the decaying problems that the country has to face due to the impact of climate change already occurring."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great move -- to make the word pass and to call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to Bella center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or had pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to Bella center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or had pocket knives.
According to a passersman who asked to keep anonymous due to his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing have ignited several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel that is surrounded by a few departments.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first of all rockets, followed by "some large explosions".
Inside the Congress Palace, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to raise awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked whether he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, that's something I didn't know.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He observed that the walk may seem harmful or useful according to the prospects.
It demonstrates the interest of the general public and the various sectors in the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District remains still far behind the head establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much more progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Educational Progress Assessment) are the persistent gap between the results of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white children at Grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the gap in success increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between black and white in grade 4 (cm1), when the first NEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results of children in both groups increased over this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in district education.
I do not jump into joy for one or two winning points, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic Appointment), Member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Eaton Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) need desperate attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what is scared is that we do not spend enough time and energy on our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren from the end of the elementary cycle and the beginning of college who did not incorporate the base of reading earlier in their school course and who are quite late compared to their fellow students.
Every day, the mathematics program for the Kindergarten (maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were set up in the District by the former director Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think that we must continue to work to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, said Rhee.
Others are of the opinion that the NAP results raise the question whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources to schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, says Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the Berkeley University, California, studying the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest districts of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting may have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that, like the other Superintendents of schools, she is trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are assured that their children can obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Schools Charter.
It takes about 200 days to have the force to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to obtain 185 days, that he considers a "point of departure" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistling.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, goes down and flashes a moment of eyes to see white columns, facades of bricks and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never put his feet on a university campus.
Also, while she and other group students of Grade 8 (4th) have explored Gettysburg where schooling costs are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of a new student impressed than enthusiast.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Shouted Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide guided them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says poeming, when she was shown the low ratio of professor of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh time the children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this is still a major issue for the large number of American children born from Hispanic immigrant parents who left the high school where they became parents at the teenage, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that allows them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "an "second generation" in five continues to study at high school -- a remarkable success if one considers that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, according to researchers, they open the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study batters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of such children reach the university -- especially if their efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them," said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think of providing a network of support for these children, from the nursery to the high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (ready for you) , it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize preparation programs at the university that begin when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of the high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the US Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Petroleum Department gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Petroleum in Iraq with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are back with a participation in only two of the ten auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who made an auction lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there were Asian and European companies that opened the way," said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum Forum, a website for information on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, confirmed by massively coordinated bombardments, Tuesday, and political instability while the US military forces withdraw, have blocked the US oil companies, preventing them from entering more force in Iraq, which has the third largest reserve of crude oil in the world, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and which were more ready to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who have maintained strong links with the Ministry of Iraqi Oil and brought their technical advice to him, have been left empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has auctioned more on contracts than other companies and has returned with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power," said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit auctions made tenders that were then compared to the barley tariff that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan.
It seems that an American missile, who hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of Al-Qaida operations this week, declared Friday by the U.S. counter-spying authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second killing attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near Miran Shah city, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities stated that the missiles had been shot by a non-pilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchical tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, declared a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking to Miran Shah's phone.
The representatives of the authority stated that the suspect local activists hurried on site and quickly confiscated what was left of "completely decayed bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American anti-terrorism representatives provided unspecific evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Al-Qaida military organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize conspiracy around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistan's territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority stated that Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known from the American general public, but it does not reduce the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a tribal-belt group of activists, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has declined since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the Long War Journal's figures, a moderate website by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have made progress to reduce their vulnerability while also killing suspected informants in mitigatingly, says the site.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultious mandate with extensive allegations of corruption during the United Nations-supported presidential elections.
Eide's departure takes place when Obama's administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed his concern about the United States' timetable for the withdrawal of troops, which would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply respect the commitment he had made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said that it would be better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it was a citizen of Italy-Switzerland who recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French person who previously headed United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and hiding evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked -- "has damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism in relation to the international observation of the elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to allow their successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than they were assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations recruitment regulations hindered his ability to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in negotiations on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier about the possibility of such a loss.
One of the most important things to me is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, that is the unpredictable side of the war.
Obama's administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motives and punishments" could be necessary to convince the Iranian government that in fact it would be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously" of these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not return its nuclear programme fully in accordance with the United Nations Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately necessary fuel for a medical research reactor.
Administration has pushed such an agreement, a means of building trust on both sides and gaining time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran seems to have gone away from attempts to agree - in part, the experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States or not.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's raid against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed in early October has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in terms of additional significant sanctions against Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set on 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations stated what it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue its discussions with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory solution in the long term".
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington later on Friday, met in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the leaders of the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are still tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm down the Kurdish anxiety about the outstanding withdrawal. The US authorities have quoted Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby, it's an additional grave."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to a single child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children famously with good toys and ruined, called the "small emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Drafted in the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's single child policy is, without doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have entrusted the police with the duty to assist the country in avoiding a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have declared abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women from a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples used selective abortions leading to an abnormally high relationship between boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city government has expelled family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at home, and to slide prospectuses under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although the leaders in a rural city in the suburb of Shanghai said they had seen an increase in requests for couples' files wishing for a second child after the launch of the countryside, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
The Shanghai officials, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caolu, Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and that they were legally authorized.
But like many Chinese, they only have minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say that the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western people wrongly consider that the single child's policy is a problem of rights," said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're stealing the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Officer, said that she wanted only one child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and had the habit that everyone cares for us."
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says this more accurately.
For couples working at two, medium class, which lower the birth rate, it says, one must be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up by seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child demands a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write your CV to get a place in the best mother's place."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the light of the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations overwhelming most of the burden, in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as far as it clarified the way to go.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 world leaders coming next week to Copenhagen.
Drafted by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to support global warming in the long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It provides great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative to Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries during the same period would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal alterations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Climate Negotiating Representative, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration became harder to China than Bush's administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries," said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the main American negotiator, either lacked "good sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially assist China in combating climate warming.
With the future economic pathways of the world's leading powers at stake, there have been deficiencies both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States discussing their respective obligations while the poorer nations insist that the two dozens of most influential countries ignore the scientific requirements of more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who would suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempts to make major issuers responsible for their actions.
It's really a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, which is also a Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries, more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a treaty legally binding in Copenhagen, although most major participants say that negotiations will lead to a political agreement at least.
The Alliance of Small Island States, comprising 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the complete political process", partly by the fact that they are now united and that they ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in the process before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their plane and hurried into the Bella Center building to attend house-closing meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be examined during the next week.
The real image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and exit from the Congress Palace every day -- of guitar activists present night shows that make fun of countries that, in their opinion, betray themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court of the great," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy.
Heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a sifflet blows the night to report the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed suburb train in the country will reach 225 km/h, while leaving Ashford, in Kent, in London St. Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburb train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will link the major conurbations of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The lost small holes will become flourishing suburbs, business trips will be much less long and the passage of the aircraft and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties are acceding to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental hazards are likely to hamper British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a government feasibility report, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route for the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred options are advanced in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line goes to the West Midlands.
The line will be divided into two or close to Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennins to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option" said a rail professional.
When it is over, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour trip at present.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow 400m long trains and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal of 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network must be built partly.
The trains will first have to run off high-speed lines on existing railways north of Birmingham, retaining travel periods between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage of aircraft to trains, as a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxers refund the loan of GBP 75,000 for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery that he built in his constituency house.
The party's leader, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the members of the parliament were "instigated", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second house in Rutland.
It had been authorized to pay the taxpayer additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month.
The Commons authorities received complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a check of members' expenditures. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly one million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emolument office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange rod.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee on its provisions of prior borrowing.
The Committee innocented him last month of any allegations of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of GBP 271.406 from his property in London to the home of his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1.400 per month of borrowing interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The variable standard interest rate RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1.250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September, after a covert journalist filmed her so-called film saying that parliament members had to survive "on the budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's national now, you have to live "on the budget" and you're treated as "of m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked a lot more, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, millionaire since his former position as a oil trader, began to explain his spending in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the cost office that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist digged a £-shaped hole in M Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said, "This was for major improvements, both approved by the cost office and then by Legg."
He added: "There are no problems with derobing, developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler."
Loyalty, come all see the calendar of the Brighton Adventure
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promoting winter months, an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using Noel's songs as a theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm, each day, with pasta and warm wine served free of charge.
Noel's songs so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant in Hove, is an unpaid priest of the Chichester diocese and Director of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why are we waiting for people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should be closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the calendar of the beach cabin adventure came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrating place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police have conducted several hundred interrogations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, have, according to the organizers, walked in cold in the Danish capital, in the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, to reach an agreement that may enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing global climate mobilization, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making the "political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the cortege, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed with black, broke windows with paving and hammers, noted a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-invasion police immediately intervened without householding.
In total, the police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them of members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups, which had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, stated the conditions under which hundreds of activists were interpelled "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them " were always held on the street Saturday night "menated and kept in position despite the extreme cold".
Parliament's party, the cortege, rather good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, the site of negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlewatch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators had come in the bus and train of major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who were supposed to form "blue mares" for the "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for compensation for environmental debt for the South," explained Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
One cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Benign singer Angelica Kidjo.
There are rivers that drain in Africa, rivers where you can walk as you had never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the altermondial movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
The French Member of the European Parliament José Bové, a figure of alternative globalism, explained that he was coming to Copenhagen for "Klima Justice and Social Justice": "Today there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which resides in many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the opportunity to send demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down on the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred students, most of them, have walked in red, grazing sun-energy bandanas.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, some hundreds of demonstrators also held gatherings to demand a strong response to climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi declared a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to Abkhaze Electoral Commission officials.
The first preliminary results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five lice candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemned the holding of the ballot.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of the territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it to be a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which has killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is seeking to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said to the 54-year-old AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a historian who said he had voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who visited the polling office in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes, at the edge of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located a little across this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the District Head, Beslan Archba, welcomed the Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazian's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," said Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a drink of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the agreement giving control over the Abkhaze railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither to support the current power nor to support the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second tour must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have travelled around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one hand, interpelled nearly 700 people in the margin of an impressive demonstration.
According to the police, a hundred thousand people, according to the organizers, walked in cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's party, the cortege, generally good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without seeking to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlewatch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the cortege, a group of few hundred protesters, fully dressed with black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, observed a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-invasion police immediately surrounded them and intervened without householding, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups that had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the cage by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of twenty people, according to the police.
We looked at the extremist groupuscules, had warned the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were turning into the sky.
The majority of the protesters, coming in the bus and train of the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who were supposed to form "blue mares" for the "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for compensation for environmental debt for the South," explained Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
One cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Benign singer Angelica Kidjo.
There are rivers that drilling in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk while you had never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the altermondial movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
The French Member of the European Parliament José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, said to the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "Klima Justice and Social Justice": "Today there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, former United Nations refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which resides in many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the opportunity to send demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down on the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred students, most of them, manifested, dressed with red and boring bandanas swinging solar energy in front of the city hall of the capital of Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a few hundred demonstrators have also held meetings to call for action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history reinforced from the reform of the general school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "reneified" from the reform of the General High School, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in scientific terminals.
From now on, the first students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because he says "the S line is no longer a scientific line" but "in general, it concentrates on the best students".
The ES and L channels cannot remain sub-filials of the S, he continues, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals suggesting the absence of terminal geography history in technology schools."
On Saturday, a Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved the government project to remove compulsory education from terminal history-geography S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some elected right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will spend at the beginning of the year a eligibility test that will cover their discipline and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their ability to teach," the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow training courses in the M2 year and then will be a first year before students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more attendance before students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the draft to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC), invited by the Higher Normal School of Urban Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the Ernest conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, noted a journalist of the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and gives them the desire to learn more," explained in the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who draws his name from the one given by the students to fish in the school basin.
A twenty-five of the experts in their discipline are selected and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding climate warming, "you can talk about hours, but you can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel, the PSA, who expressed itself without notes, but using graphics, in front of fifty people.
This is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will hold that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these conferences will be placed online on the school site from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is planned in February, followed by others at a bi-medium pace.
Payment delays: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The prison overseers' unions called on Friday to "general mobilization" to require the payment of premiums and overtime payments for budgetary reasons by the end of the year.
FO Penitentiary (2nd Supervisory Union) has asked staff who will not be in service to protest and "block" before prisons on Tuesday morning in order to "declare theft of their duties".
The CGT-Penitarian (3rd trade union) calls for them to "meet in general meetings in the various prisons for strong mobilization", which "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "surplus hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of overseers, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "requires general mobilization (...) to bring back discontent and anger."
The Branch of Prison Administration and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensured that the remainder would be paid in January.
The Chancellor explained at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the union of supervisors to ensure that this payment would be made next month.
I am not aware of the staff's efforts to operate and modernize our prison system," says the Minister of Justice in this mail.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation, resulting from a bad assessment of the number of overtime hours, does not occur in the future," says Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be low, except for management staff with the famous duties and objectives premiums, has deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, has indignationed the interregional FO Union of Marseille, proclaiming its decision to boycott up to the order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to take care of the staff's interests, the Bordeaux GTB Penitentiary believes.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less badly lotted than others.
But in any way the account is not there, noted the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says offering "smoother shit" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, has entrusted the "pappass" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple rule about gifts: "I give more nice things than those I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast Sunday evening on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the four-legged little companion of the family will be part of the game.
The Santa also loves Bo, thus said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have a "safely" gift, according to excerpts from the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama filed falsely against her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts he receives: "I did not, I offered you nice gifts last year," she taquined the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replicating with humour by showing finger the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, at the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a strong support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw him offer at Christmas.
I remember this time my father came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered on her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles because of significant "leasions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia undergone in Paris on November 26th, reported to Paris his press service, stating that these lesions had "need a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service wanted to rest assured that the situation was "under control," and announced that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last singer's tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been dived into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
The press service, interrogated by the PSA, neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also states that "by certain sources" no drainage would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this discrete hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days, had been performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated on the RTL Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but assured not to be "no worries" for rocking, which is "a beater".
He called me just before leaving Los Angeles, and I told him it was a bullshit because doing 12 hours of plane after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to be reassured, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "dedicated".
Mr. Camus had also said he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health problems of the singer have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had been shown to have been operated with a "small colon cancer", then with a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings even had to denounce a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal at the World-2009 in the Great Basin, scored an international title on Thursday on a distance which he especially cares about, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in the small Basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, when combinations are allowed for the last time, saw only three records of the world beaten while waiting for a depletion.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 nages and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 nages relay.
A regret for Bousquet, which was on the record of the world of the 50 m free, whose brand it holds in the large basin (20.94).
On one of the two distances of the swim, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, one first at international level.
Bousquet preceded Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but did not succeed in lowering the world brand (20.30) as he had thought.
We can always dream better and in the middle of the day, I had said that if the world record was at my reach, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed with polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
Starting with 238 records from the world since February 2008, these combinations ended their epop in Istanbul, which had welcomed the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time in German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the large basin this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the mark that he owned in 400 m of free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless enforced himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel, which belonged to the French writer Emile Zola, was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, clearly above his estimate, announced the art dealer Sotheby's.
This front panel of two meters long on 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bricks, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Roman and Egyptian art auctions at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still in progress, but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have most auctioned so far, said to the AFP a spokesman of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it part of her bath in her private Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before joining the power of Maréchal Pétain.
There was still a shadow zone for fifty years.
By searching the database of the Museum of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions for the transfer to its territory of the fallen president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were no longer met, which was rejected by the Putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met," said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday to Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government aircraft went back to its home, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a "safe conduct".
But the President dropped refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the incoming Head of State.
The Putschist government "has experienced a new failure by wishing that I give up my burden (...), they wanted me to resign," said on Thursday Mr. Zelaya at Radio Globo, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few agreements the fallen president, refugee to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted an application for extra-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum," said Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, to the Hondurian Radio HRN.
I don't ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras should be made as the president of the Hondurian people, he stressed.
The rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the President-in-law who came to gather around the Brazilian Embassy, where the soldiers strengthened their seat.
The Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he considered.
Zelaya, who had approached Venetian Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was reversed on 28 June, the day when he organized a popular consultation to prepare his reelection, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on 21 September and fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he gets out, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high treason" the accused of justice, according to the Putschist government.
President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in holding a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising on Thursday, the US trade balance figures showing the resumption of activity both in the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and Nasdaq , with technology dominant, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Enlarged Index Standard & Poor's 500 awarded it 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from various sectors of the economy, judged Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotic, tempered, considering that the market was focused on "the half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell from 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected to increase the deficit on the other hand.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, reflecting the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against any expectation last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
Treasury voucher return at 10 years of age increased to 3.482% from 3.423% Tuesday evening and the voucher at 30 years of age to 4.492% from 4.408% beforehand.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of power conspire to the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government took on Thursday the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were interpelled.
A quarantine of "Women in White", wives or close to political prisoners, were attacked in the middle of the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they walked to the centre of the capital to claim the release of political prisoners, noted a journalist from the PSA.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionarys!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" scanned, the stab lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by civil servants who came to "protect them".
The next day, a similar demonstration had taken place against the White Women in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day, have been interpelled by civilian police officers, found a journalist of the PSA.
According to this reporter, the police forced the dissidents who were attacked by government supporters in civilian vehicles.
Dissident interpellations in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
The European Parliament's Sakharov Prize 2005 recipients, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissidence, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda sentences 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda was part of the 75 Cuban dissident group arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remained under lockout.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
The Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-governmental activists against "contre-revolutionary".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of abusing rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forcer kills a knife octogenary and 5 hurts Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed force of two knives killed a octogenary and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at one hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for indefinite reasons, an octogenary, in or before a pharmacy of the 85 Jean-Jérès boulevard, was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
He was severely wounded, the old man, born in 1929, according to a member of the Alliance Police Union, died in the hospital due to his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who was thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, severely wounded, were admitted to the hospital where the Octogenist succumbed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then had a discomfort and would have been hospitalized "in state of shock" according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be taking alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then escaped on the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have wounded two passers, apparently at random: a thirty-quarter and a quadragean, the last severely.
The scenario was still confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in cross behind his back, explained on site a leader of the Alliance trade union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, according to the AFP's testimony, have tried to control the Forced.
I saw a guy of thirty years with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was clever, reported Alberto, server at a bar close.
A crowd fell upon him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jérès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, including their responsible, tried to interpelle the armed man and were wounded with a stab, according to the police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passengers came to tell me there was a person injured out there.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in security position, and I saw a very important plague in the abdomen, told the AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later arrived a second person of thirty years, wounded with a knife.
It was the national police staff who arrested the man without identity documents.
Nanterre's Attorney-General seized the departmental police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forced woman was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from attending a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were required to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forces of this species whose forces double under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of the prosecution
The French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again called for the abandonment of the prosecution of his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a murder case over 30 years old, in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States).
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", declared serious procedural errors in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second District of California.
I call for the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge responsible for the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who died since -- would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious error of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and wanted), of the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "menti" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The accusation, on its part, reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski was present before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had escaped from the United States in 1978, prior to the sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has never returned his feet to the United States since.
The Deputy Attorney General of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "did be there to attend the hearing".
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requires a favor to the court, while disregarding his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed "there are other alternatives to leaking".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of the charges against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Noting that her client no longer stands to be harassed with every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "Person in this room cannot say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on american arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his cottage in Gstaad, waiting for possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, braked by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while Nasdaq, with a dominant technology, abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "has contributed to improving market opinion on the solidity of economic recovery", summarised the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers increased significantly in December, at 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, the highest in the last two months in the face of the euro, which "throws down sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technology values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has declined.
Treasury voucher return at 10 years of age increased to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the voucher at 30 years of age to 4.497% from 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World's election again in South Africa
After a month's journey through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last line on Saturday to realize their dream: being elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great fair of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them already picked up their ticket for the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This has been a real turbulence.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and had so many experiences!, shouts Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 (1500 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to restore my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice," stresses Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, his second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with candidates and the rediscovered "landscapes to breathe in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presented to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It's the dream of any woman being crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it's not just the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, throw Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance, this 59th edition will be punctuated.
Candidates will be rolling in traditional suits and of course in bathing suits.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty purine Michelle McLean and a director of Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, Miss World's president.
As last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on the bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with the South African president Jacob Zuma who tightened their hands.
Not common for a Head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the fate drawing in Cape (Southwest) for the June 2010 Football World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've met people I never thought I could get near.
I will certainly return to the World-2010, enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is very positive, according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to the jaw of his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it goes very well, said David Hallyday to the press on his departure from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1300 local (2100 GMT).
The son of the singer, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very fast" to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant lesions resulting from this intervention.
Her wife Laeticia went to French school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade was educated, to attend a school show, noted a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpetère hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurochirurg who operated the singer on November 26 at Monceau Park International Clinique in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outdated, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday had "been far too fast to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor online in person who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that surprised me, since I myself had two discrete hernies, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "departed without drain, without nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had performed the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated with Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematom as a result of brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly condemned by justice, in medically responsible cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the Doctors' Order Advocate, accused him of being "a man without scrupules" prosecuted "regularly" before the Order Council, and who is "soon to be recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly done" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not bleeding and therefore did not require the pose of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and sum the New Centre no longer use its seal
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt of OPA of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the ex-Giscardian party, calling on him to no longer use it on any support, under court proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, considering that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after turning his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy before the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
In support of his approach, he received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) claiming the property of the UDF brand for being the first to file it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But Friday evening, the UDF office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not hear themselves depossible, came out of his silence to launch a call to the minister and MP, calling for them to no longer use the seal and transmit the property of the brand to them under court proceedings.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to +reply+ the UDF seal, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis de l'Alliance Centraliste.
You also thought it was good to follow on your militant material and on your website's guard page, the name of this movement, the +New center+, the slogan + the UDF of today+, also notices the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this seal," explains the UDF office that urges the NC to "immediately withdraw the name of the UDF from any support and its website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of the (the) trade mark to its legitimate owners".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, inform the signatories.
In their mail, they stated that the UDF was "a full political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its three-year accession to the MoDem and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he deposited the brand," he was not "a member of the UDF for three years" but at the UMP.
He exploits scandalously and fraudulently the absence of the UDF acronym to perform it on his behalf.
This indifference is turning into a crime, do they denounce, before ironing on the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy of making itself a name by itself than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not right."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he has benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenary to spoil her part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years of imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a story about one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter were breaking up while keeping the thrones of the Empire of Cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt's medical expertise, 87 years old, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit such a review, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors designated on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt has been weak and what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said at the end of the hearing, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) Expertise will prove that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we need to protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated criminal prosecutions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist at all, who she accuses for years of benefiting from her mother's weakness in obtaining a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or masterboards.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always rejected being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to large family unpackage on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For its part, Nanterre's prosecutor again found that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardian's judge has refused in the last few days to apply to her request to initiate a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the Public Service, Marie-Chrstine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers once the trial had taken place.
Managing revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence would have been vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees reminds the position of companies towards consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a question of bringing employees to "values" determined above, as it used to be, to impose on consumers products designed by the factory technicians.
By placing the client at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has restored market conquest strategies to the spot... although the authoritarian temptation to impose unconnected products from customer preference factors returns regularly!
Employee demobilization can lead to mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emergent part of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects managers.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R & D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
In fact, the EIA "requires all stakeholders ... a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires employees a commitment that the authoritarian management revenues are completely offset.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would be to put employees at the centre of the business's concerns as well as the client.
All relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- First because I found that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally comes, after many diversions, to do priority... what it has always done!
- Then because authoritarism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behaviour.
Issus of major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, to their unconsciousness, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, suggesting that the "sic" of the leadership's commitment is possible, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in a mechanical governance position that is inappropriate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of incorporating in any reasoning or practice of governance a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve part of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
At present, only studies from the Reasonal Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their management of human resources "in the place".
They thus create a field favourable to the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: the "just war" is worth praises to the right in Obama
On Friday, the American right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the previous day, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the United States' enemies.
The Conservatives, who had embroidered the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the Vice-Presidentship in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right-wing gery of the Republican party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she himself had addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
Of course, war is the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she felt.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "of a very good job" in Oslo.
I found the speech really very good, welcomed the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this very historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed at the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen "a left president" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not return a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's old spring converted to Washington Post, Mr. Obama spoke "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president," reminding the Europeans "that they live in a bullet of security that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a flock of Bush era, the former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, described the speech as "inspired, sparkled and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed by the fact that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When enclosing war in the concept of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the centre-left press remained elogious at the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was prematurely assigned to Mr. Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "was to serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," fired the Californian daily.
Mr. Obama "speaked the speech that was needed," said the New York Times, judged him "both dark and building".
Routiers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and TLF, the only employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the word of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signature meeting on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiations started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion the bargainers had left on a small morning Friday, with the hope of signing the text of agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even if three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had closed the door.
But it took even more than six hours from a meeting beginning at 11:00 a.m. to ensure that everyone agreed and that the text was signed at 6:00 a.m.
The conflict " would have been very harmful to businesses" and "he was afraid that he would come to disrupt the end-of-year parties," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (in international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "one moves from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not much, but we're leaving very far," explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Or we're going to order our activists that there are no blocks, no blocks of the supply centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal," although it was " difficult to grant high wage increases in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be around 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a revalorization of the travel costs of 3%, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, inter alia, to address the issue of a 13th month and modernizing the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending Financial Act for 2009, which was voted by the National Assembly in the night from Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to undertakings which are affiliated to this organization, and secondly to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," said Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employer organizations can only delay the process.
The UNTR has declared a "dupe market", as the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to contravene the next wake-up turkey eaters, deplored Unostra.
For Otre, the agreement is at risk of "growing the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector within the next 12 months".
RER A: disorders this weekend, union discontents with RATP's proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, the largest urban communal transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a Friday on the second day of strike between the trade unions and the direction of the RATP left them on their hunger with regard to their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10:00 and 20:00, for one in two on the central section (between Defence and Nation) and one in four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change train.
The Lafayette Galeries, which are waiting for 200,000 customers every day, have been pleased that "the RATP is making efforts to serve the major stores".
The RER across the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains travelled at the top hours, and virtually no rags in grey hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians organized themselves.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "a thirty hour earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, stated the SNCF, which had planned a framework of officers and order forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to reach the metro.
New general meetings of gravists will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon, which is considered "migrant" by the trade unions.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, indignationed the CGT, stressing that the direction "was not screwed up with solving a problem while in roads and the SNCF it was done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of professional activity", the RATP specified.
This also made the trade unions say that the company "was making fun of weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee in Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, who so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in an effort of comfort".
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after the deposit of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions claim a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to a million daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros premiums, for shifted hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice dissolves the pro-Kurdian party, a heavy decision of consequences
On Friday the Turkish Constitutional Court declared the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdian party of the country, a decision immediately followed by anger manifestations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the government's task, which has just handed the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "foyer of activities that would harm the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Court of Justice Hasim Kiliz, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the members of the party, including his President Ahmet Türk and Ms. Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity from Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasure of the Party's Property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Attorney-General of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the Kurdistan Workers Party's (PKK) "directives", considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the PKK's rebels' legal political window is the DTP.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualifie it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The judgment of the Court takes place when the government has just handed the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to take the support of the Kurds to the PKK and to put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a resolution could lead to increased tensions in South-East Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the Chief Abdullah Öcalan PKK have degenerated in conflict with the police in recent weeks.
From the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the south-east, with the majority of Kurds.
Order forces pulled from lacrymogen grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people have also manifested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of the Justice would "approach despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Curide, ndlr) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party of Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are fundamentally opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete torch of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
It can be expected, of course, that the PKK reacts, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most murderous in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the responsible for the road deplorment and steaming service (FES) clearly states that this is not to bother the citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technology and learn how to master them properly.
And according to the metrologists, it might be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and glass.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as he starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sparkling vehicles travel 20 main routes (named Routes A) .
This includes high traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Including fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and streets on slopes such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-adhesive road melter, within a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3:00 a.m. "to ensure that the roads are cleared when daily migration traffic begins".
Now or it gets harder, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the manager of the road deletion and steaming service "because no car rider is willing to let the steaming vehicles pass".
Then, if it snows, we take care of access roads and deserter roads - such as Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets are the last ones.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this is always a few complaints.
At 5:00 a.m., the FES Pedestrian Team is on its way to identify priority areas and crossings that are considered dangerous.
As far as cycling routes are concerned, ESF services are generally not able to handle this.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the status of bridges between 22 hours and 4:30 hours.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
There is also a need for the police to call on this special service.
The dinosaur beard
The Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivore dinosaurs: this bipete was about 2 meters long for 1,50m high, its later members were powerful, its elevated skull was equipped with aerated and recurred teeth, his short arms end up with claws and he had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as reports Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the Thursday Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the lands emerged from the supercontinent, Pangea and was located towards Ecuador.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa lights up the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, he provides us with information on the relationships of relatives, their distribution and characteristics.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt started searches with other paleontoologists, on the site of Gohst Ranch north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis from the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the search team tells them that sometimes they found a dozen oesons in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers have named him Tawa according to the words of the Hopi Indians for the sun's god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander from the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but he states that it allows to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making the classification of all the first dinosaurs very difficult.
The experts wonder, among other things, when the Saudis were divided into three major groups of evolution: the thropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the cyclociraptor later appeared and from which the birds, the sauropodes, the quadrupedes on the long neck, and those related to them and the ornithish herbs, among which species such as triceratops and steroids are part of.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropodes.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found indications that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in its bones at the level of the skull, as well as the birds that were descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebraes have also been partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest teropods with small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of the huge sauropodes also had air bags and a light bone, one can think that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the primitiveest known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologue team also discovered the remains of two other theropodes that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers advance.
Alan Turner from the New York Natural History Museum and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course there are some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologue in Bonn, said that there was an even older species, the silesar, who lived in today's Poland and belonged to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a mistaken vision because there are a large number of fossils of dinosaurs in South America that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs have succeeded in becoming the dominant tetrapod of the secondary era while proving a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery today.
At the Trias time, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other Saudis.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
However, such a success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There may have been a massive extinction where dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then the dinosaurs were better suited, so they could eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite's development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then was in the shadow: they were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are teachers from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are classes of the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino at the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers at the University of J.W. Goethe but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protestant students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the police intervention requested by the university's Steering Committee.
Last week, the President of the Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and works of art were barbed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
Signatories believe that degradation did not justify "a violent intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "inadmissible damage" to freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on vandalism acts only serves as "delegitimating and criminalizing protest" and attempts to forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee has thus withdrawn from the debates that would be necessary.
Course officers require that criminal prosecutions be suspended immediately.
The majority of occupants did not participate in degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The young people in the Verdi trade union of the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity among students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future," said Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi trade union.
With regard to the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took the initiative of the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable," she said to the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday at the TV broadcast Current Stunde.
We understand the sense of protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The SPD opposition parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Left)
Instead of thinking about students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party filed a motion that sums up the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret arms, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronics production and research sites are implanted there.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of French science – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been mutual meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of Close Cooperation".
The signatories were Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, the strong point of which is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow companies of the FIZ to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet institutes and research companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") draws its name from the wooded hills where the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed sufficiently high.
For his supporters, it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21, it's much more than the rush of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will immerse the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The main line stations, with roads that ended in the city, had the reputation at the time to be the relics of the 19th century transport technique that effected the brake sabotage of modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
That's why the main train stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train crossing station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, from which the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have not been compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of leaving the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the main line stations no longer really pose problems with entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railroads and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the achievement of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new trajectory of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have taken it.
The railway company is partly because it is the taxpayer who makes the costs of the largest federal infrastructure project and not the public undertaking.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which - and that is typical of the 1980s - was attributed a huge growth.
At that time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new track, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
S21, and this is much more serious, is indirectly concerned with many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be consumed in the Sowjet project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other connecting and loading points in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport refers to 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom thoroughly here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking sabot.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the cornerstone of the traffic in international goods, which is in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment delivered on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government mentioned the possibility of appeal to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal's judgment on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the northwest landing track of Frankfurt Airport would be implemented.
The authorization to operate for 17 aircraft between 23:00 and 5:00 a.m., as the Land Government considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticizes this time limit and attempts to press the Government representative for him to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The Head of the SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted of prohibiting night stealing. Otherwise, this will be considered a total failure to a given word.
It is quite difficult to be allowed to hold his word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's reproach, which claims that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights by using "aquarium and robbery".
It takes time to carry out a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the declarations of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
American banks reimburse the aid granted
The large US banks, which are very affected by the crisis, are depriving themselves of their links with the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (over EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The American CNBC television chain reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to remove the restrictions imposed, which were accompanied by the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to directors and the settlement of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors, which gave it $19 billion of fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, Director General of the Bank of America, had to expressly thank the US taxpayers: capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank institution had assumed its capacity by purchasing Merrill Lynch's investment bank at the highest of the financial pain.
The Citigroup also envisages obtaining money on the financial markets in order to get rid of the State's guardianship.
As a result, the US bank could launch a capital increase of $20 billion on Thursday, reported the CNBC chain citing banking circles.
The spokesman of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had returned the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated election
Eventually, everything went faster than expected.
Only two weeks after the limbing of the current editorial post Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German Chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial of ZDF, was the great favorite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there has also been a willingness not to further harm the officer of ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed the vote of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for the extension of Brender and 7 others had voted against.
In fact, the CDU, who is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, not wishing to re-examine Brender.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief by invoking the fact that the ZDF's information programming rate had declined under Brender.
That's why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, exploring the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had been involved in the debate and who felt that the way Koch acted was anti-constitutional.
But it hasn't served anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied science-policy, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Southwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national quota).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first of all at the "day-day" news magazine (day-day).
Then his course continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant to the editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bien-monthly information broadcast presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial.
After Brender's disgrace, while he was just elected journalist of the year by the specialised magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
The Opponent of Koch to the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhenia-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the supervisor cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political personalities from the ZDF Supervisory Committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vigorousness in his decision to limoge Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as could the Board of Directors elect it without being able to place a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberal from the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more reconciling: at a meeting between Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must enable the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload must be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to providing more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's courses.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulations from one country to another.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June last year, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the professors of universities have been constantly speaking in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Every module must normally be able to be completed by a single examination," can be read in a 30-page document on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of the examinations, we should be able to stop the drainage, which significantly damaged the studyability.
In addition, "studentability" is expected to be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if you cannot avoid this feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and margin of action necessary to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every five years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation board established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exercised some pressure on the Länder to weigh on agencies so that the programs were not too burdensome and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhenia-Palatinate has so far been the only country that has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorielset programs to strengthen educational guidance offices, examination offices and international relations service
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies must be more flexible and recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be ensured and access to the Master should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studentability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the study conditions in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said that he would like the organization of educational policy to cease in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as persons concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the Rectors Conference Delegates (HRK) Margret Winterman: "The student experience is very useful for us," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW), the decisions taken in Bonn are not far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enter a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, furthermore, requests that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students have enough places for Master's studies and the best possible conditions of study.
The Länder therefore need to hire more curricula.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of lessening access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrived in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he themes in bribes of alarming phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost his language territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest, and later, director of collection in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the very coveted chair of poetry from the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Securitate files".
Obviously destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received the German language award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able to resist enough the intimidation trials of the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is the instructor Walter (IM Walter).
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary disguise with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shattered, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and bass of a political system based on police surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assured the literature specialist Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner, and he referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favour.
"He could have pulled it from all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, but the awareness of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and sometimes have guessed which real names were the last to hide the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
On the contrary of Germany, where the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been constantly counterfeit and braked over the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the return of files has been rather slow since then.
There has been a law that defines the management of archives since 2005.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of an ex-director of the Securitate in Temesvar, who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize award to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very decent way with respect to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was interviewed only once.
The infamous power thought it was possible to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been spoiled? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's conscious, let hope that the follow-up to this chapter will be more defined by a thirst to know than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a footnote.
Tumultes to the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was coming there, pulling four spikes from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports article manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB Christian Gross coach climbed at midnight less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier to the hand.
The man, whose lean skull would draw attention, was allowed to drive into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our quinquagener could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn't drunk alcohol, nor was he drunk of happiness.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because now it's going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just begun three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the League of Champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni from Romania," but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "great work" is waiting for us Sunday.
This is about repeating the results of the daily champions' League in Mainz.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurrect after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing to the fate
The eighth final of the Champions League (match to go 16./17. + 23./24 February/match return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be released on December 18th in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminating post of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only among those who had had been lucky, who had transmitted to the destabilized professionals in Stuttgart, a complete motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "worker of souls" – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so well but that no longer had any effects with the treater Babbel.
He triggered some magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter - "in foot when there's a new impulse sometimes things happen that you would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury breaking, went to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the " phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the present situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the top, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs especially toughness.
Like Gross, the players and the manager keep themselves well to overestimate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had a bad wake in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season, but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't gone through the difficult line yet.
That Heldt has no heart to celebrate on the 40th anniversary day, even after the first victory at home for three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview by the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made rebound just before the game began.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, but Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerbe criticism.
He accused the direction of style weakness and said that she had decided to change trainer under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the matches had been removed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" pushed Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked being friends for life with these two quadragnarians.
In all cases, they agreed with the rest of the world, i.e., without the prior work of the group by the replacement coach, strong sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" and Heldent and Lehmann retorted in choir – and even the man with the plastic bag acquired.
Heavy Car World Championship
Hot Combat in Berne: Kevin Johnson challenger continually provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defended its title as the world champion of heavy cars according to the WBC federation's version.
Unanimity of the judges, he agreed to the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as the world champion of heavy cars.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday's night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points of unity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been honored to defend his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the world championship title of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately he did not succeed the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the battle, from the top of its 2,02 meters, through his left-hand side.
Johnson, 11 centimeters smaller, who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the champion's hits, thus impressed Klitschko to bring into play his right-hand sparkling.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mainly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures, his beats only very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having crossed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko's treator as a "wrong zombie" who is "not really capable".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion was unable to cause Johnson by dropping his sunshine from his nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko again committed himself to his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to abandon without battle.
This year, defending his championship, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola from the United States.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His revenge is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having debrised the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, bears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional company is now planning to make this game play at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Front attack of the opposition: the head of the Green Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence of a lie in the case of Kunduz.
The SPD and Left Party (the Left) ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately hiding certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formulated a falsification" on the killing strike of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the Green Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the release of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 2 p.m.).
Clearly, this means he lied.
The order to kill was given to total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report at NATO's disposal, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the Lafrappe was, in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to make a statement to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Green Renate Künast Party believe that Mrs. Angela Merkel must state clearly whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan government's policy if the Chancellorship, the Army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The spokesman of the Government categorically rejects these criticisms.
He said that the Chancellor had no influence on the military intervention in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts about the real reasons for the resignation of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the department.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details to the Minister.
In the surroundings of the two senior officials, however, they have informed the Department of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
To date, he has not received a response
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred them to the Federal Parliament's investigation committee, which would be set up on the next Wednesday to give light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, everything awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only among mentally ills, or under the drug effect, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our sleepy rooms, we can give ourselves without obstacles to the most crazy dreams and fantasies.
But whoever, awakened, has the experience of the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in mentally ills or under the drug effect.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious awakening state, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of the cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and effect are different, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen mystical, the drug experiments of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of chamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or confusions when the balance, neurotransmettric substances of the brain - first of all dopamin, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts are very often manifested during schizophrenic psychosis.
The strength of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always considered the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awake dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a character of a comic.
His body is in two dimensions with screaming colours.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, it flies at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels like a blow.
Behind him, creatures of the devil winged, griming, the bloody mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, give him feet with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Tonitrutant, bad voices, screaming, coming out of walls and radio.
He can no longer support those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. breaks two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook fixed on the ceiling.
He climbs on a bubble and passes the loop around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop's off.
That this serves you as a lesson, crying out the voices in a choir to cut him off the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get yourself cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in its life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics this is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitement, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship folly or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is drowned under sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the CHU psychiatry department of Heidelberg (General Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum) .
The schizophrenia is located in the centre of the situation, with a meaning focused on it.
At the same time he is in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act actively on them.
This is why schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience once in his life of a hallucination.
In contrast to the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real context.
Why our brain is doing this kind of cabrioles, is always a énigm for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to instantly losing the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only decisive factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have minor brain injury.
It is assumed that brain neuron maturation is disturbed at an early stage of development, e.g. by a mother’s viral infection during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the neuronal system abnormality occurs and, in addition, the fact that it does not appear for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, however, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What's crazy, says Professor Erich Kasten of Psychology in Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Real World in our Heads".
Hallucinations are well part of the simultaneous phenomena typical of psychoses, but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease or brain trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They develop when the areas of the brain that deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refurbished; when our brain warms, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental conditions.
In recent studies, a third of the participants recognize that they have done at least once in their lives the experience of hallucination.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town of Mecklembourg-Pomerania before and went to high school.
A young girl doing everything normal to tell you.
If there weren't the images and voices.
During the recreation, a young boy, thin, with long châtain hair, sometimes speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dream, but Sarah K isn't dreaming, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young kind.
Am I crazy?, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
In the night the appearances are, in general, terrifying.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is apparently explaining equations in the table.
In the night the appearances are, in general, terrifying.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that arrives too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dreamed already, if the images she sees, the griming faces or the young girl with blood-lined entailles on her arms and legs are open or closed in front of her eyes.
Leave me alone, scream to those creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She got her bag last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she got into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Insane is also a work of desperate art.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulations, the probability is high that he will have hallucinations after a certain time.
I suppose the brain isn't busy enough, making sure there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of the other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not her true father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "is in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form themselves in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally distinguish themselves from those in acute psychoses.
In contrast to schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises patients to love hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our too-focused world of consciousness, we are quickly tending to take imaginary experiences for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Doctor Chief of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of desperate art.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of the experience called oniroid, a special form of changing the consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroids are very complex semi-drooms that are perceived as real by the one who sees them and that he cannot distinguish from the dream even when he is awake.
Oniroid consciousness manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with full-conscious polyradiculopathy, experience engine paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, it replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change is taking place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerant situation, a capacity of organization that is given to us, men, not to fall into the nowhere of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichian Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a safeguarding action for the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious travels for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplantation; during that time, his body is sentenced to remain still in reanimation.
Claussen dives into a world that he created from all pieces, visiting foreign places, traveling in time. He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his head guarding for his health.
He lives at the middle age among nobles who make blood-based drugs.
He was kidnapped by a Greek motorbike who took him to his country, surfing with his hospital bed in the Neve of the Alps and met a Korean mafia.
He absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these internal travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he wrote by describing what he had experienced.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than real life.
The intensity of this experience shines the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of external reality are even in a watchful state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten "can cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take the rest of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to resume the press group," he said in the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain a 100% family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to integrating society, said Hubert Burda, 69, in the Spiegel.
All details have been set in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be asked later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able to do so.
It is not possible to impose their children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they are able to take care of them.
This would destroy children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he would withdraw from the position as President-General in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the Treasury sector, saying that he was responsible for the company's capital, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he also took the lead of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time, it is not a family member who is head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda were 19 and 17 years old, their son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families who have been trained by a capital boulimia, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, said Burda.
I do not see myself in the country's preceptor role as Springer could be, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken far too much importance.
Full Beauty
Everything you can wish, in terms of beauty and well-being, to the reach of your hands.
This is the objective that El Corte Inglés has set, which has just inaugurated in the Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious fields such as Hedonai, specialist in laser epilation, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdryers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or the Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding radius, with in particular a tea lounge, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while viewing the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxing area for two hours to organize your own Beauty Party with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a champagne cup.
In total, these are 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything begins with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located opposite the device.
Several videos then show us how to do our exercise program properly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including warming and stretching) are sufficient to make all muscles work in the body.
And, if we want to go through the hairdressing room after having done our body work, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where you can offer hair repair rituals, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the orderly words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10:00 to 22:00.
Various decolletés
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the decollete, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, take care of the electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona Ayuntamiento, created the "Ovicina LIVE".
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the capital of Catalonia.
The "Ovicina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implantation of Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of electric cars in the city and will establish mobility agreements, through approaches, coordination, grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will involve the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalonia Generalitat.
Its aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and is in the process of a series of additional projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the Executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would now have a abandonment landscape, closing some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Automotive Sector Integral Plan (IPA), devoted €800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The executive leader explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, as referred to in Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with Autonomous Communities and Autonomous Companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and has contributed to a "significant" increase in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collection Cars, a meeting room for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
We can not only find motorcycles and collection cars, but we will also find items in ClassicAuto Madrid in any way related to the world of the engine.
For example, with flag exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, reviews, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, French Cup Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External Skills Test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, skills tests, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests with cars and collection bikes will also be carried out on a circuit fitted outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just incorporated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system, i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-heavy petrol engine 2.0.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
Details, finishing the vehicle, usability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixing.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the ensemble formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futurist interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright red and blue colors.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic style.
That's why we can say that as well as the Mazda3 as the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
Successful with the apartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough inhabitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large safe with regular forms.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the gasoline engine of two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its thinness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 most requested are diesel models, those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the series equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed controller, photosensitive interior mirror, a large-scale computer, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment was not sufficient, this version had the Pack Premium, which, for another 1500 euros, includes, among other things, two-xenon adaptable lights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not carry out much kilometers per year will be able to choose the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horse petrol engine 2.0.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this important amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
"Luxurious First"
L.A. covers the red sensuality carpet embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever shed us, dressed with models as elegant as sexy for the exit of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our Pe, as sophisticated as usual, had chosen a dark lady.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility to see certain types of attachments or to navigate on the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States, when the magazine Time named it as one of the products of the year.
True, it is harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's data subscription.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his U.S. grand brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what the fact of giving up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a café on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to view their mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is amazingly attractive and it has long been supposed to work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
Reminders to the repeated order of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely tangible effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device such as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have the Wifi) offers this kind of tariff, means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals that allow them to rent their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without galleries.
This is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option with life-access as Peek already offers in the United States.
I don't want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply wish it because I believe that this is a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the U.S. Presidency to take Barack Obama's position with a dress and a coat of this colour, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, undoubtedly the most important of her life: the Nobel Peace Prize to Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their resemblance color, a yellow pulling to the green with brilliant reflections, two times, the dress was composed of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
So, at first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States follows the sleeve of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to return the same clothes.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the operation, then it was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: from green to medium heel shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hair was also changed: the hair is now lifted while it was worn unloaded the previous time.
75 per cent of mothers working had occupational problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased over the past few years, especially for young-generation women who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Federalism and career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Mujer, reveals.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of the mothers working have seen their career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of coupled life and the number of children, whether women work or not and the type of employment employed.
Those who don't work outside the home, work part-time or have a little stable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back entry into couple life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being coupled. This figure goes to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "The data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to delay the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercises have a major influence on maternity, but less on the date of common start of life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who completed basic and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average.
"A further disctipation also occurs between women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed basic studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed medium- or higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Mrs. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oreal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embodie the image of several products of the brand, astonishing the universal currency "Because I value it."
The protagonist of Happy Christmas, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, thus joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were the Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the brand of cosmetics also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomie lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His largest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, met for the annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the date.
Ex mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer d'ass (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty "radiographics" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does not do so according to the predictable and perceived genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not save any fears or illuminations.
Delightful pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you here a few instants.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, which I felt without appointing it: the pleasure against destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any gods."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an Allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a glorious poetic humor, with no sense, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman by a passion that lasted 13 years, in which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perishation."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand metres from universal literature, which must be climbed by the north side, on which the best alpinists are still letting go."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of greatness."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the dementious cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did it in the escape of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she went on her knees and prayed: "Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved the worms of Spenser: "Sleep after the effort,/ after the storm, the port,/ rest after the war,/ after life, tired of death. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depression.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII spiked him between the axles or that the birds sing in Greek.
One has never seen a man as patient and in love with a nevrose whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it was not to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if it's not to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to seek the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestile?"
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked in our area of Fuenlabrada City, when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed next to her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six pounds, and without saying anything, they had two foots that left the dog severely wounded.
Our indignation is enormous because we do not see what it's fun to attack a small, defenceless animal for free, which was also left.
In addition, the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when injuring these individuals, was able to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic who attackes an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an elder or ultimately any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5:00 a.m., one Tuesday as another, in a typically quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been hiding all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the neighborhood police, even if we doubt that this serves a great deal and in order not to touch the sensitivity, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The indignation led us to declare this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defensive animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, kits for the harness of helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcycles, as the two structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet port, as it is the only protection element to avoid head injury, or even death, in the event of two-wheel accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet encouragement campaign under the currency "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest diffusion of them.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a two-wheel tyre manufacturer, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, as the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, if all vehicles entered the category of light commercial vehicles (transported by passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) were sold 95 853.
Large clouds that most affect their demand did not dissipate, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
In addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of banking credits, other factors, such as rising unemployment rates or the persistence of poor economic conditions, need to be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between passenger cars, 2000E purchase aid has not served much.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who want to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Last night, at Ganvam, it was reiterated the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The association of dealers foresees a year 2010 similar to that of the end, for which it calculates a 19 per cent fall in sales (touring vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this happened with the ABS brake antiblocking system and as will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a shortage period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure imposed by the European Union is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant shall act by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver’s footstep.
But the latter does not always maintain pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to push the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all their strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revanch, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one out of four damages with injured persons would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises maximum brake effort to minimize damage.
General Motors revokes until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Figueruelas factory (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that he will need more time to conclude the Orange Relief Plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, says that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, in GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken within the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is important.
In the event that there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Drived by the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to design their last and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers have gone from the Boxster S and have managed to reduce it with nothing but less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1.275 kilos.
This caused them to pass, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual roof, which allowed to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as those of GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the petrol tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports tanks, another 12 kilos, and with light tyres of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they abandoned the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six more kilograms and replaced the door handles with tissue handles, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model also exists with the double-breaking PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads from the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly bad turns.
Its behaviour can only be regarded as irreproachable.
The reduction in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aggression.
On the contrary, it was a long time that we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, ensured as much safety in turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
It's a willing engine
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that changes the engine's rugging, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at stop or during recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The surface of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed well the chicken nests.
Electronic assistants barely reported presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found verglass in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra lightweight, most entertaining car to drive and is much more than a simple change to the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of 70 831 euros.
Bag Girl
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Coco line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a "bad girl" or "it girl" is a "bag girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the archfield of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences of Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus at the forefront of its group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight three-point baskets, was the best of its team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team has been able to fill the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclaims and applause back to his old home, to increase their benefit at the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 scores marked, although Splitter's "minus six" evaluation had already predicted that this night would not be the best Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's that they won not so easily in their field, and thanks to Elias' hand, they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the benefit of yellows on light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, who were injured but far from dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to take the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine was released, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas, which gave the meter a restraining score (54-67), and that the premises managed to increase at the end of the third quarter period (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) said they were not going to disturb anyone to take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for error, Ivanovic's players did not hurry, defended well, and while the Israelis came closer during the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The wounds prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost noisy in Greece in front of the Olympiacos and handed over to him the head of the B group of the Euroliga, in a game marked by the absence of unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been frightened by the atmosphere of the Flag of Peace and the Amite, nor by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful of Europe and with a large budget.
The first-quarter-time game made it possible to make the andalusian dreams. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point baskets, two of the Omar Cook leader and one of Guillem Rubio who spooked the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis internal game, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start to fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal defects of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Indoor players and Lithuanian ailer Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, digged the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
Unable to get up
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and even equalled the difference in the disputed meeting in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group heads of the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point Cook baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos proved unpleasant when the players made pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeded in raising the score at 81-62, at thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja remembered, accepting the Olympiacos victory.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates users' salaries from over 140 000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week since the application has been working, the research engine has found that, in general, the Spanish worker "has felt badly paid," explained in a release the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 gross euros per year and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives EUR 34,247 gross annually in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least paid work in Spain is the server, with 11 592 euros net annually, followed by the seller, with 14 725 euros, and the worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil fixes a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his Embassy of Tegucigalpa.
The Vice-President will have to abandon the diplomatic delegation by 27 January 2010, the date of the official termination of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, business officer of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Me" knows he must leave the Embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He realizes that he must leave on January 27, after his term of office, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the political exile condition that was supposed to be imposed by the government in fact chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, in which asset inflation has been the dominant mark on the markets, the uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in a environment where agents make decisions on a future of uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to raise debt by direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions purchase assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without jeopardising their non-compliant liquidity policy, they are starting to put some sand in the rollers, as the ECB has done, with their bidding at one year of the next week.
As a result, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without heterotoxic measures, and we are witnessing a reverse of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock exchanges and the disparities in corporate bonds are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been obliged to socialize the private risk and public debt is affected again.
There is again a trend towards quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, provoking an increase in differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further revision to the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who again tried to cause a case of conscience among the world economic policy leaders who had hampered the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to establish a new Day of Merciful Action.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the emirats to restore its power in the emirats, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissolves a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be irrational if the Ecofin would save Hungary from non-compliance with external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area to fail to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek Government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we face a normalization episode of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our disparities in public debt are increasing in line with the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If Europe's gaps were reduced and ours continued to grow, this would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecasting indicators oblige most study services to anticipate their recovery models and revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not open up much hope for warning them.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment "caution is a mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Members, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán made eight-closing talks to the press about what he had mentioned before the subcommittee.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50,000 million up to 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power stations are currently in operation.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million but 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that investments in the next decade should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that more than 18,000 MW are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposed Government's recently approved Sustainable Economy Act is in line with what its business demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate warming policies.
In his view, there is "a clear, long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "punctual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has said.
However, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial's subsidiary for land airport services, will play the role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus' privileged associate for freight services in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are one of the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million up to 2012, 50 per cent of which will be from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market on which she is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The yard at stake is an estimated $1,700 million of Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway dealer.
The city mayor wants to be able to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under Erns & Young's supervision, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
In pending the submission of their offers in May next, the projected investment is $1,700 million Australian (approximately €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortiums, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only smooth Spanish company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground work specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield infrastructure manager and the French Bouygues builder group.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gallician company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large yards and privatizations, but entering there is a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, which have already been mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place on this market by its 30% participation in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionary assets
Acciona puts a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the decalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and runs the grouping of companies to set up and manage the Adelaïde deliniser, with a budget of 700 million.
The Commission now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the said Northern Link (Northern link), is called to connect the western Toowong motorway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the invitation to tender will take place in summer 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open for traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise two channels, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $500 million in Australia (308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief largely fruitful, which yesterday mentioned the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will, through its local Leighton subsidiary, equip the infrastructure of the national fiber-optical broadband network.
This will enable 400 000 people to access the Internet quickly and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has abandoned the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share the construction and management of two school groups with Laing O'Rourke for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC receives a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been granted the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, amounting to €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after it was found to be responsible for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel, Austria, for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and its completion will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore is viewed as advocating Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately €3 million per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Sra. Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies who have submitted themselves to the Renfe bidding, four of which have been finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to inhibit competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes in the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and yet state-owned company accumulated more than € 450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it poses to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased as the competition authority considers France Télécom to have committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivist.
An application shop
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company followed other operators and opened an Internet application shop with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange Applications Store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in the third and fifth position of the clubs who took the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the major clubs.
In fact, the competition has allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to information from the UEFA.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to get the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former Cup of Europe in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern of Munich, the two teams who, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And this, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the allocation of money applied by the UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, the UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification games (by which the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each contested match.
There is also a bonus for victory (EUR 800 000) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive in the quarter of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, in the face of the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça took 2.5 million to win the Super Cup of Europe in August.
In addition, there are variable payments to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The previous year's champion picks up 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid on the basis of the number of games played during the current year edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the stock purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be paid out in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Sos's shares ended yesterday at EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa's offer assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has assured that it has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has stated that it has contacted the regulator.
If this was done, the disbursement would be 611,7 million, while Sos' capital would be 254,27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and go and comes from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes it the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free from polemic, since the company remains underwater in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the next months Sos reveals new misuse of funds cannot be eliminated.
With regard to the credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representants of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes the Paternina Exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Values Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9th.
The Supervisory Body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were aligned with the existing standards and considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted to it to be "sufficient" following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV explained that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the capital, consisting of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, he explained that 5 592 778 million shares were immobilised and that they could in no way be transmitted before the finalization of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars who have suffered damage are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each damage is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculating the cost of repair by hand between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000, including the coins and the workforce can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for damage assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing them and offering them to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the area of evaluation tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so in the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes into the market, these companies start working.
This is a very hard work, because each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be cataloged and its price recorded.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model can be clicked on the different parts of a car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work can be completed within a week if the process advances very quickly.
If it is a car that is not sold, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has full information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer a variety of products.
The most frequent application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of crack parts or for the calculation of the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of Audatex's products, it is easy to find an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the lighthouse product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of damage, for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the complete identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it comes out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows for auctioning on declared spoiled vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, to carry out geo-demographic analyses or to know current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to examine, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a failure or how many serious damages have been suffered for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damages, failures or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% per year over the past three years, and it has reached a business figure of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she started its internationalisation process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
On the other hand, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global business figure of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on a stock exchange of $1,000 million, and its shares are now estimated at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been on the New York Fellowship and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Auctions on the Internet of accidental cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15 % next year.
The goal of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to an enormous international market.
This estimate and sales service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cassettes and professional vendors who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and runs more than 650 000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 operations in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed may no longer circulate, but some parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be registered again, although they have been removed, after complex approaches.
Four-step garage devises
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in only four stages: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, more or less, are reluctant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourists, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears then the required piece is selected.
The user may include variables such as labour price, increases or discounts, then it can print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
At present, Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
