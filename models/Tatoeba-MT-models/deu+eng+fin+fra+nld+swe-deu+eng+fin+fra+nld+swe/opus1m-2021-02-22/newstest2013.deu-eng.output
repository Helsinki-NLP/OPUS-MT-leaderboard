A Republican strategy to counter the reelection of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that the election fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, in 10 years, the Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting the elections in each country.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have proclaimed new laws that make the process of registration or urnishing difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for the early vote, declare the right to register as voters on the day of the election, and allow citizens to agree on the right to vote for which a court act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State requested the voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to claim such a claim.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million electors, do not have any photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a ID.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often payable to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and people with low income.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29, do not have the required photo ID.
This is more than that.
Students who are regarded as voters who give their voice more for democratic candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no federal government has requested proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Spanish votes.
For it is clear that two out of three Spanish voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators in eight states promoted laws that abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist those electors who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to register voters during the 2004 general elections have contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other federal states aimed at shortening the period for the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, although they are only 13% of the federal voters.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who elected in advance.
On the other hand, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the display of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
Democrat critics praise the party-political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that decide for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that the states that adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral panel to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer prevention: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows defective results, with false negative or but also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger hesitation of the men already undecided to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We picked up the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous disturbing factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that after 12 years of follow-up, the probability of metastasis formation is greater by 30 to 40% if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who had already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for males of African American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancer types that are aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases he rather decides to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and are offered treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for a decision which should be dealt with and who should not be determined are increasingly accurate.
That's why I still recommend carrying out the test.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle medicine to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
However, approximately 10% of cancers are expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It seriously damages human health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets speaker André Beaulieu.
Stimulating data: 10 years after the waiver of the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, Grimm intestine, Mast intestine, dietary tuberculosis, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects all the life from Grimm intestine cancer," he adds.
The Diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of suffering from Grimm- or Mast-intestinal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconsistent.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase rather.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasises the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family precariousness.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Bosons has given rise to a certain apprehension last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or least false explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not yet entirely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know without any doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data are still missing to be absolutely safe.
But let's assume that it's actually the Higgs, because there seems to be only a small risk of deception, and let's look at what's going on.
There is an inevitable law in this world, which results in that two objects cannot be present at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strong because you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that they also have such a law: the Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quota state", with this "state" in general consisting of some of their properties.
On the basis of this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called fermiones and are steadfastly obeying the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons are moving, a bad band of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same time at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely surprising) these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be related.
But it must be emphasised here that these bosones are not all such exotic creatures as you could think.
If you are able to read this chronology, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bottom" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" exactly in this place, in like a silicon stone thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "dragers of power".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disrupted" so that this Boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond whose surface could only be frightened by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold onto the refrigerator itself.
And not all particles also interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as well as the photon) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research be "good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine all differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are many physicists who are most likely to hope that such deviations will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has major deficiencies, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renews ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found in the CERN.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent strip laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was seen as a "lab play" at the beginning.
Imagine...
Applications can also be made from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics in 1969.
Although it wasn't the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and introduced him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our life, but it means that you can really never know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its committee for "Death in dignity".
The debate will have to be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that raised him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've done seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Bel eye, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he accepts to be helped with the dinner.
He is courageously able to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring his medicines to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that my diarrhoea be cured because this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life we learn that a man is pinking in standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"This depends on the ability of the person," he finds a step back.
In the opinion of several people working in palliative care, large events take place in the middle of these steps.
Patients who are sent to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are no longer accumulated by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But through the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any desires in life," she says before she accepts that she is put on a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, you can offer a group of volunteers and help in eating food.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11700 people have a bed for palliative care.
That's very little when you take into account that one day we're all going to die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person can be treated with Brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetic patients no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"We also help family and patients," says Care Director Nathalie Savard.
In the Victor-Gadbois home is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows, while hitting his honor, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after he tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients sent to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their residence, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Montreal area, are more or less specialised exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this large shortcoming in Quebec's health care ensures that several specialist doctors in palliative care look forward to the adoption of a law on the regulation of death relief and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifest has been in circulation, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting death relief.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in emergency, without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients broken despite worst forecasts until the last day.
Helene Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I will stop the treatment, she answered me that she regrets that I will give up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who asked to die thank the nurses that they did not accept this desire after their pains have been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the end of the life, the doctors often rely on the terminal sedation, which results in either spontaneous or permanent sedation of the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more likely to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to sleep in me", but "I want my pain to be alleviated".
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, the main construction industry, money-procurors of political parties and specialists from the Italian Mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are involved.
A "industrial" which was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has collapsed since drastic action has been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former Head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him as a result of a thorough investigation of the misunderstandings related to the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the Prime Minister then only refused.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them had their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to the fall", he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "demonstrating the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The 2011 established permanent anti-corruption unit also makes great efforts with its troops to conduct auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Truppe", which since 2009 has made Montreal's "canalization cartel" proceed more reluctant in the artificial exploration of the treaties...
In the last few weeks, she has carried out series of house searches and brought charges for fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubricants in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were strongly accused.
The latter has made it more difficult by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts.
He himself paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 21st century, Mr. Zambito had his hand in play everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals who had been in power at that time.
He also admitted to have organized an illegal acquisition of funds for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts whose costs have been artificially blown up by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice cream games, as well as bribery money of $736,000 in return for sewage contracts, whose costs he artificially blows off.
Other officials of the Road Construction Office have admitted that they were able to be slimed by artificially blasting the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking over a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which resulted in a serious crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to hit the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, from 2010 she opposed the sale of a community property that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that "it draws a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system that is migrated by ants in order to stop the evil and accuse the guilty".
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are about to clean the wound, but we need an investigation unit for Montreal only, as well as supervision to prevent the return of the questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on his part, notes that "official officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of the "mandatories who are in the picture of tactics" if they were not involved in fraud!
On the basis of a 70% share of black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he whispered: "I was told that this is only a slight disguise of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which, according to it, would not change the situation: "So long as the election spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going on the matter with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and Montreal's reputation, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to take a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of game every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since I started in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They therefore make use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals this summer are used to playing very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the forehead and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti enters respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1 and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he put in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took us the seat of the top rider.
But we're in the back of it.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: this is how we qualified ourselves for the Eightth Final.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto so that we can carry out the replay of the 8th final as a home play.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win title and make itself a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to adopt concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as it was in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to dedicate this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right year.
Although the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are ringing the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it's normal that much of us are expected.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can blame us for, that is certainly a little frustrating.
You're wondering what the people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that hasn't been able to qualify for the Eighth Final for two seasons, and which has also made huge spending!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed in a 15-point game break!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better to talk about a clatan addiction.
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and proves he's the star of the League 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people surrounding him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French National Team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from hitting out some game time.
I've seen things that I've become stronger from there.
Today, I succeed in realizing good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the blue.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our teachings, and today we have to show an exemplary behaviour.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Blue"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualifications Group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to the players and encourages to win.
Like it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the blue to Brazil.
Is the indiscriminateness imposed in Spain on October 16 (1:1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables direct file exchange.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a payment method.
After Bitcoin's price reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all net nodes are at the same time bookkeepers, auditors, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts account that is spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to record this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add it a number before the whole is "hackt".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (multiple zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right number.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay with the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) to cheat, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without connection, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionthistile, leaving some room for...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services to Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The weakness used does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for real money payment and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these deficiencies.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the accounts and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega lock sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses it to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are rethinked in favour of more horizontally orientated systems.
"It will take some time to get Bitcoin through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Moreover, the ECB's report provides for a reassessment of the various risks considered to be high in the event of the success of this currency.
We've moved from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and destroyed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders, who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The deduction of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have observed by a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French loans, was correct.
The truck and tank convoys overflighted by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was removed from war due to the struggles of the various rebellious groups.
Their takeover of power was at that time considered to be a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until now.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have transformed into businessmakers by seizing land from the government to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive US award of subcontracts.
They have been dismissed, and most of them were not involved in the struggles themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who could make use of American grants: the capital escape is considerable.
The young people have tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; now Kabul has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
Those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
There is now an army.
Will the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle already strive to restore the militia in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the Prime Minister's office since the Constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make him a centralized state with strong presidial power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industrys have not been rebuilt, functional dusts are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a 30-year-old country of war, State control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had enormous land resources.
This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to empower themselves to do so.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on-site, or without means of transport for an export through the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) leave their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The deduction of French troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young people, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a civil-military service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was resigned in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for rehabilitating agriculture in dozens of mountain villages, and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of combining aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which many local workers were required, could help to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys that are more than 2000 metres tall.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from communities in the province of Capisa.
In order for farmers to get rid of the revolt conducted by foreign groups, which is their own desire, it would be necessary to continue with less, more well-controlled civilian aid to their benefit.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has now been based for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President maintains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step the right with feet".
On the part of his supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period for the brothers to renounce their intention of explaining the text section for section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is dying throughout the country.
After confirmation in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well-willingly.
In particular, the Egyptian people are put to an ultimatum with this recourse to a vote overhauled: "Even if you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power," the latter should probably end after the Constitution has been adopted.
85 most Islamic members of this Constitutional Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have failed to comply with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned out to be unable to implement their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 persons, alternate members, were added in all hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, since some members of the panel felt that the pendel clock of the Constitutional Assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was still adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Sheilfulness" responds to the Liberals, who only regard this as a propaganda strike.
They say that the Constitution is being islamized by other articles.
They are particularly concerned with Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the present one.
"No concrete religious commitment is currently recognized.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system," weakens Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
However, he admits, "that there may be a ambiguity in relation to Article 220, as the terms used are disregarded from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, reference is made to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised about the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised because of the extensive powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute is the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military request, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, civil proceedings in military courts will not be banned, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text which they consider as a threat to freedom.
The act of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasises Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of sole
The praised country unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unaffected nature.
The AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Browsing before the Holy Places
Visit the river Jordan in which Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who swim in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus accomplished his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding celebration, the going on water, the calming of the seastorm and fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are in Jerusalem.
Here believers take the path of suffering or crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian viewpoint, is the navel of the world symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the Cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the wall of lawsuit, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, there people of different religions leave letters with wishes that then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies, which Herod of the Great built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins of their own power.
Everyone else brings an airline to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which countless tourists attract in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is once the Israeli Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth visiting.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which hosts several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bath servants at the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir shops there.
The entry is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most impressive department is the monument for the children built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the space, there is complete darkness.
Stars swing.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are on the banks of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarias and oceanarias.
Surprisingly, in the Red Sea, also in the winter months, the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed throughout the year.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even bears non-swimming easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and cure sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and to calm tightened nerves.
Touch the secrets of the old age
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and altagyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his arch right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to slip through the narrow streets named by starmarks.
Fortuna should be the legend held after all those who touch the walls in the street with their starmark.
In Jaffa you can encounter newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stretch through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are listed today.
Bookmarks for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: About 30% of Israel's speak Russian.
The money on the trip is preferable to be taken in no euro, but in dollars that can simply be changed into cheques (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 cheques).
In the city you usually go ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway train and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations that connect the suburb to the upper city.
Precisely, it is a underground standing rope track.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, including transfers for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the sabbath is committed in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday markets and shops are closed, and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only cosmic food is served, which excludes pigmeat, marine products, fish without bowls and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammel and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, frished pallets of purple beans and peas (falafels) as well as fruit and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli towns there are no swinging dogs.
For this there are many well-fed cats who walk comfortably and unpleasantly through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to tasty.
Depending on the brand, a car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs more than $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 cheques per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numerical numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreationists came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the promised country, which represents an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa requirement was cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and citizens discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force that requires every worker to carry out a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the local housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, the tests with time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, are expected to become mandatory for all host workers in the future.
Not only language tests, but also tests must be put into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which the Russian language is official.
Persons who received their diplomas and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also excluded from this law.
Purpose, problematics and protection of rights
The whole of the examination bodies will be under the egide of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can carry out the tests in all cities; already more than 160 appropriate centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Citizens, on the other hand, asked in the press several times before the law came into force: what does this bring about?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills for both the Russians and the host workers make?
In particular, respondents to the Migration Authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many people now talk about the protection of the rights of labour migrants," says the head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems are encountered by migrants without a profession, education, language skills and medical review.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will necessarily meet people with evil intentions who will put him in a dark, narrow barrack under the pretext of help, where he will end up with dozens of his same months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home, you will be promised one, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken away and you will not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the Main Administration for Labour Migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shrink, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to make their money in Russia admit not only to dominate the language of the target country, but also to hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbekistan and Tadjik can afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, not to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children take the first opportunity to earn money immediately.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' rights emphasise the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to carry out the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Forbidden Access for Unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A counterfeit registration can be made quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police staff know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadjike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"No cost for false papers"
Already on the day the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants could be counterfeit.
Some counterfeit certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for nothing: every migrants who hoped to save the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a worker three thousand rubles.
The main immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and citizens agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise host workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will receive time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores the illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in criminal offences is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
Thus, the authorities respond to the recent events: injured at shootings at weddings and seven dead at the Moscow legalist Dmitri Winogradow's amok run.
The police want to ban the use of non-mortal weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported and promised the Chair of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, that the amendments to the Arms Act will soon be tabled by the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "attraction of screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to abstain from "unintelligent reinforcements".
The percentage of the crimes with registered weapons is very small, declared the criminal criminal, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes were committed using registered weapons during six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand delicts were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves in the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find any possible weapon for little money in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons come into the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both police arms chambers and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms camps.
Many military camps often experienced explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was burning to hide the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private armament plants that do not stand international competition and therefore slurry the weapons in the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a own, sometimes handicrafted production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Crimeal Literature and Publicly accessible data on arms portals.
According to the investigators, the majority of illegal weapons originate from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
The report states that half of all weapons on the black market are there due to the "debt of responsible persons who have come to their hands on weapons in their work".
According to the researchers' data, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% return to thefts in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor of a weapon store, who doesn't want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavation have not bought anyone for a long time since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to get the retreat in a weapon camp.
A gun, such as a gun of the type TT, is purchased via a fence.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police know everything and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the crime detection plan, carry out periodic check-up purchases from dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales advisor adds.
"Such as in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers are most common about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone got alert to me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but you have to go there and meet with a code like "by Ivan Iwanowitch, which lets the daughter point out that she has lost a tooth".
I'm even coming to some rings about a friend I trust.
He also delivers the rings because he knows that I don't piss him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
He said that the schemas did not change.
He received a photo album in which "all possible" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," the military member remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, but I'm driving with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There is no need for any paper or personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a fighter gun or a gun".
There users enter your orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Naturally without license", the user asks "Iwan" (written quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the Lakonian question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless spot web pages, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service network.
People come as hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and let coal go
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"As a response he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that in the end you can go out empty and get behind grids if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless spot web pages, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service network.
"The people come as hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberian labour camp and let coal spoil," he says.
A macarow for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices of $100 to $900 are expected.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarow for $100 to 300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps of mid-range overseers.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's official statistics, the number of illegal arms delicts in Russia throughout the period January to October 2011 fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers in the United States strike
Each fourth American teenager sits behind McDonald's cash sometime
In recent days there have been massive protests everywhere in the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon go out again.
Protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, the organisers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
To date, this industry has hardly been organised by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which outsells took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handfuls.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from bubbles to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart files is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the product only because the employees are paid badly.
The latter also complains about severe working conditions, such as missing fork stickers or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on Black Friday called for wage increases and expressed their anxiety that the contribution for the own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 the hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart $ 3.2 billion.
These are about 1.1% more than they now spend for wages.
If Walmart completely deducted the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be only $12.39 per year for them compared to today's additional expenditure.
Walmart's supporters are pleased to note that there were protests only in nine states and that they did not pay any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in its store from 8:00 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart Kassen carried out almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's speaker, Dan Fogelman, in an interview on the website of the left-winged Huffington Post, claimed that, in total, "less than five" Walmart employees had set up the work and the protest action was only "an additional PR trick" of the trade union that organized the protests.
"Freier Kass!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart Filials (which were not desired in this advanced city and are therefore in existence so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars an hour.
In fast food restaurants the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
Less than she, no one deserves in this expensive city.
How it's possible to get out of New York with so little money, I don't understand.
There was once a time in which almost a quarter of all American teenagers, after school at McDonald's, stood behind the tea, but the teenagers still lived with their parents.
Hardly one saw the main source of income in it or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to deal with this pay and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose authors say it is irresponsible to get children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests that began on Thursday at 6.30 p.m. in the morning before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue called for the cashers and cooks of Fast Food restaurants to receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and to dismiss or dismiss trade union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Discontented
There were loud protests that day before many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast food workers so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of which not all are employed in the fast food industry where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet possible to see whether the radio of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
"The brain can only be overwhelmed moderately"
The topic of expanded reality popular with trailers of modern technologies has recently been usually perceived by the lens of a special glass.
First Google presented a working model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It attracts the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with mere hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly the research that your group conducts.
- We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machines, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
To date, humanity has largely remained stuck in the phase in which pixels are used on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to foresee 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect since everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fantastic.
However, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also its surroundings.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overestimated?
- It is certainly not the solution of all purpose, since it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all those around you about their actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their specific niche.
For example, in the area of the control of objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and narrow, rather than loading gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
However, overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestice and language.
- How?
We would ask you, for example, to give you this spray dose?
They say it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the time and what does not?
- Not necessarily, but this is about mutual approximation.
I think that in the next time we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types that will enable us to capture more accurately people's reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make on the basis of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main issues are not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a regulable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors close to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction between human and machine.
For my work I needed exactly this device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared station and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem because more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations to find out how this helps us with the three-dimensional identification of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the lifted hand on the way, but I think that the most great variant would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (Privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as an unusual projection document.
It takes great pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "imagers in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still as weak as someone pusted over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve ends in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overwhelm the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with running belts (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately overlistad, and many years are still working.
This is precisely what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to urban residents who form the Avantgarde of Art and Culture.
On the list, high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene already landed, whose success goes beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad bears, once at the Russian Museum, once at the summer garden, once at the scene meetings, or when you meet at the vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street, he enchants his fellow citizens a smile in the face and gives them good humour.
Shortly ago, he caught a spinning organ and became Petersburg's spinning organ player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist's presence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the colour Red as a fashion designer who is dealing with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grey norm, aggressions and bad behaviour emerges.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Cultural Palace of Newskij, at which my work was exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I friended myself with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was the result of "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it ended.
It attracts me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to be at the centre of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musical-art club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Snur and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight trikots, and among them was the composer Igor Wdowin, who was called for today.
When the group started playing live, it became her "lening bike".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the foundations with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in the art clinic.
There we went to our staff and family guests.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press on the award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was at the highlight.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a human being of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an invincible style.
- Many of my images are real beads and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it's painful and scared to be like that.
In a clown, it blew everything and lost its tragedy.
I love the Groteske, and I have huge ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone takes care of the clothes and orients itself to the outside and not to the inside of man.
But maybe you should not give a man your hand, but spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
A city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of cultures.
Earlier people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But the performances of Stas Michailow come several thousand!
- Come to him abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted pictures that were even hanging with a collector in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It says: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something quite different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Kirill, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said that the servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different in the real tsars, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some of the experts, but they are blocked, because there is a need for higher-level experts who correctly evaluate the first ones and give them the way.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore need to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding soil.
Art can only grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural soil, for example, because we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it's much less.
Art must be modern again, as in the beginning of the previous century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in the World Hall
Earth in danger.
Heating or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthbornes on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can reproduce ourselves in severity or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be possible at a large level or in the orbit of the Venus, i.e. in the All.
The question of reproduction in the whole was first addressed by the researchers in relation to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of herbs grown in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precise of small fruit fly (drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, Watchelee eggs were sent to the universe to explore the effects of gravity on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicken must be holding; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chickens were wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely depressed.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
Four days later they just died.
"Two times we let chickens sneak and then set up the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew holds on to the failed experiment with the chicks in the universe.
The last cage with animals flew to the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will only be similar species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into the universe.
In principle, nothing special has been found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space councils got young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are crushed from their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproductive drive.
Contrary to animals, humans could basically do so.
The homo sapiens is able to think abstractly and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out on ethical grounds.
But women have been flying into the universe for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk with Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing humankind possesses is the female organism.
Our mood flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Can she survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to birth after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says Space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in the All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We only have extremely few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they received healthy young people.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into the orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a state of swiftness, the cosmonauts win routine for work in open space.
The water represents the gravitylessness.
Even though adults feel water pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's like the little Ichtyanders testify that life on the land escaped from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the mother’s belly in the fruit water, and that it can then become more used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming just lasts 2 weeks.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swimmer Marina Aksenowa.
So, while for a newborn child, gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, abdominal and pelvic muscles decline enormously quickly, thereby also reducing the ability to express the child.
All right, let's do this with birth-initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to press the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the non-insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earthly cultivation, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a stress suit like an adult for training in the orbit.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the creation of a disabled person, a completely unsuitable person," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
To date, the birth of children in the universe is only theory.
At some point, however, it will be reality when the Earth's inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a distant planet that will be the home for their descendants born in the universe.
NKÚ Chief: Control of the Black System Failed by Indebtedness of Politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and appropriate laws in connection with public contracts, but is deteriorated in their application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this says the Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (NejvyΕλλάδα kontrolní Ελλάδαad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case for us," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he suggests the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system therefore forbidden or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the control office whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, in its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Control Committee you spoke of a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries relating to public contracts were compared.
What was the matter in concrete terms?
This is a parallel examination with which we started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is that European legislation defines how public contracts can be handled, building on it by national legislation, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws may even be a little more "strength and perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to re-establish new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to consider the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Just such common control could help us to stop constantly trying to implement the laws and to reduce and eliminate thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it's even the case that we only load the system with excessive "Papierkram" in this way, and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German Pendant to the NKÚ of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to ours and also has a college which is formed only slightly differently. However, in principle, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are these offices in the individual Länder - the German system is different from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed with us by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the State Accounting Offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all.
Maybe it's because the auditors are better there?
That is certainly not the case, but, as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that also those countries that are an example for us have problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have anything to do with cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the importance for your authority of updating the procurement law, do you already feel any effects?
Given that this novel is only in force for a short period of time, it does not have any effect on our tests yet.
As our checks are carried out later, we have to expect some delay here.
To date, we have a rather impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "recognition of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed - the changes will obviously have an impact here, as the thresholds have changed, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, there may be the problem that the rules become more stringent and can no longer be respected.
Already under the previous rules, persons subject to examination are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any failure to comply with the procurement law is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But is it reasonable, then, to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think it is this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
Let us first tell you which path is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not cheer the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, in its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and let it happen," but he can't say that we're acting like nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer because of formal errors alone.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what we think is missing.
On the streets there is isolated glacier, but mainly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice glazing.
However, most of the roads are well-driving, sometimes increased caution is needed.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well accessible this morning, and there were isolated snow and ice glazing.
The temperatures fall to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it will be slightly warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the deeper altitudes, only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the ore mountains.
According to the District Road Guard, the vision was limited due to fog.
The highway R6 and the first-class road routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is given, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
All roads of the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, there are partially required or exhausted snow residues on these roads.
In particular in higher situations, greater attention is therefore needed.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is a danger because of ice glazing, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes a snow layer on the streets, the road and motorway direction share on their websites.
The street masters warn riders of ice glazing, which can occur especially in higher locations in Pardubice district.
It can be found on roads of the second and third class in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory Mountains.
An outgoing snow layer is located in heights on the streets of Rychnov nad Kn.nou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely free from depression.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in Pilsen District are well-driving today, but local attention is needed, and the way of driving is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice glazing on the streets.
Locally, fog is also expected, but the vision will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended by road masters between the 80th and 131th kilometers.
The first road tracks are mainly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of Pilsen and Tachov circles there may be ice smoothness.
The second and third road tracks are wet, so there is also reference to possible required sections.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Snowmatch today has to expect drivers travelling towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snowmatch remains on the passport Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský.
Nightly snow drive forced the street masters to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to information from the street administration, about 3 cm of snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the railways are usually fully accessible.
"In the circle of Šumperk, snow remains in the heights.
On the Pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snowmatch in the direction of Jeseník," said a road manager Šumperk today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník circle also had to go out in the night, according to their information, the streets up to the heights after chemical treatment are free and wet.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet here.
District of Ústí nad Labem, District of Liberec
In North Bohemia, the street masters also report several poorly accessible road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glazing, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to traffic police information.
The temperatures are also lower than zero, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. On the other hand, no problems have been reported from the deep levels, especially southeast of the central Bohemian mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
In particular, ice glazing is reported from the Štětí district.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - rain over the day and melting snow, in the night of cloudless sky and freezing.
The main routes as well as road I/13 on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported to be poor traffic conditions.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches pushed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about that in less than a month of the world's fall?
This is one of those disaster reports that we like to jump on to people.
With our band The Tap Tap we make ourselves more funny about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's fall.
In December you will also realise a unique project with three concerts against the world's downfall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a country-wide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, that is, December 20th, three concerts will take place at 21:00 a.m. at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about at the time the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Whose idea did this come from?
Originally probably from me, then we developed the idea together with our graphicsman Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world down, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand over this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world's downfall, with which the purchase via www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other interpreters, the so-called hymn against the world's fall with the title "Welt's fall out".
Even today, the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound on the benefit concerts?
Of course, in the end, provided that everything works and the world's downfall does not happen...
The hymn is to be sang at the same time by all the performers on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit by Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tom★ Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also singing Xindl X with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which relates to the fact that we realise many benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in and enjoy working with us.
What is the purpose of the redemption of concerts against the world’s downfall?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years with the Association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building is to be built into which we will then enter with this project.
There are several groups and interpreters at each concert.
What criteria have you selected for?
We wanted to set up a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support for Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji★ Suchý appear.
For more information, see www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" also planned for the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time in Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would also like to link this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, of course, we have to drag many instrument bags and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of how it looks in individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than with us, we were witnessing in Russia that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for disabled persons. There it is still unusual if someone is on a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious there that one leaves a wheelchair driver in his elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that are trying to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we need to retrieve the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're hanging in after...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not very common that there is a larger group of people with disabilities actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really begin to change.
To date, these are only individual cases of particularly willing personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am musician myself and play, among other things, saxofon, I have founded a music-AG with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, as our moderator, L.a. Angelovič, used to say, something out of control (laughs).
But the band was only known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with famous singers has helped us, and we have also started to advertise actively for us.
We have become aware that, if you do something and this cannot be seen outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment, and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential that you can handle things differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other today.
This is logical in his way, since everything new is carefully viewed and accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I swear to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the spectator usually has is, of course, compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed something, this is not just a progress for them, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something right, you cannot make compromises in many things and you must also demand some discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have a test twice a week, have to carry out preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm for many disappears quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been involved from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: L.a. Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and desire to participate is always welcome with us.
To be held on the day before the predicted world down, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected through live-schaltung and it sounds like a common interpretation of the hymn "Weltuntergang fällt aus" of the band The Tap Tap.
The purpose of the concert is to provide the resources for the provision of a multifunctional centre for disabled people, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age free of charge, cards are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was the twentieth member of this space authority at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency ESA member countries. Poland is thus the second member of the former Eastern Block (in the Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasts worked on space, not always with understanding.
For example, I recall the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Input to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the REP-hirsch Prize, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Input to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books about these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to space development was recognized, among other things, by the name of one of the craters on the earthly side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925 a railway drain was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the drains.
The information for this purpose comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-operated shots.
The research was carried out by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents supplied it is clear that the research was premature to the stage of practical tests.
Research was then obviously interrupted by the entry of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the design of a photoelectric hunting dragon from Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the press, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects concerned the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects on military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Transitional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was terminated by the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space society.
At that time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was foreseen that space research would have a future.
Already at its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact PTA became an ordinary member already in autumn 1956.
The following year was the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Space Federation.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, in the B.Dów wilderness, flight tests started with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe elevation winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was discontinued.
The first RM rocket was replaced by the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) of this rocket were developed, which differed from one another in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg operating load to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR Committee for Space Research in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites within the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit work.
This decision called for a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, full movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with stubborn financial speculation.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
Under this term, a state in which the manufacturer seeks to maintain economic competition by importing favourable goods by "subscribing" competition in order to increase its market share and to increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy it in a favourable way, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and therefore does not bear responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure will necessarily rise.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that Mr. Entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall economic and social damage they have caused.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The disrespectful practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population, thereby attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital without taking into account the social consequences.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic constraints on long-term unemployment and on the other by reducing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a few years in Germany, there have been public food levies for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected already goes to the millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the State must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of assistants employed in the German Bundestag.
The saving measures in virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly come to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate (as it was in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, or for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here, naturally, the question arises: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, poverty only moves from one country to another; or the capital remains as much as possible, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, the workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state cannot participate in its own economy with capital, and that the plan economy leads to economic disasters.
The private capital firmly insists on its view that the State must not intervene in the economy in a guiding manner.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even guide politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and universal lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advancement, legislation, in which virtually everything is struggling but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that, in the absence of finance, a state department has a private, closely industrially linked legal entity to prepare bills.
These bills will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer the result of the people, as declared by the Western Constitutions, but of strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracy is now rapidly entering a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the times of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state has been in decay for a long time, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubrication, by illegal deprivation of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unobstructed, and the people went to the election with already purchased votes" ... "Humans with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "It was really started to talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation being a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but then then the strong man was Caesar who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the unprecedented preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to general social interests.
Private capital is already, from its nature, unable to recognize and enforce the benefit for the entire society.
The result, today as at that time, is an unprecedented decade of the elites, who are not at least seeking deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of fascism and communism in the unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the collapse of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites are in complete ignorance of the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters which we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know of them from the older and recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a lasting solution.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population downwards.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is, "that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no war," says the dying Goodle Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip there was, as always, a number of reactions.
The ones stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is born in these ever-recurring waves of killing and who is the victim; finally, the people of Israel today, including the self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence themselves.
It's about me to open the view of the readers behind the scenes, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are especially helpful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question whether it was really always those personalities themselves who decided their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who guided their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hand of less individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it has not emerged within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, there is a particular one that could be described as the head of the creek (I don't know if anyone still stands over them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already purchased by Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in which the background was always the strengthening of their power, the multiplication of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or prepare themselves for them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghadafis only remained four, with Russia in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschilds Bank of America's status as a central bank, began during the civil war, issued its own (saying: state) banknotes and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue its own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Ms Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after he wanted to sue the FED for the start of the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 to 1871, the world's power lusts of Rothschild led to the formulation of a plan for the decommissioning of three wars by Albert Pik, a freemaurer of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate Europe's great monarchist state beings, and the second war, in particular, should break the British colonial rule, and the third war should reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number such as this would provide for their conveniences and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the forefront here) and finally lead to the overtake of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, so that crises such as those caused by them in 1907 do not repeat).
After the murder of the Habsburg throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo had succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian tsar kingdom through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic unfounded kapitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsar kingdom), then the Greater Power of Central Europe of Austria and Hungary was dissolved.
In order to facilitate the development of World War II, the bankers made a latent conflict situation created by politics by demonstrating Germany with enormous war repairs, creating the condition of poor masses, making it only necessary to underwhelm the Germans with a sufficiently strong leader offering the blamers named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-municipal state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should take over the function of a fifth column and also took over to facilitate the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, mentioned above, created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; first collisions with the resident Arab population occurred.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler was losing himself from the chain where the international bankers had held him at the beginning, or whether everything was going on according to plan, it is hard to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If international bankers succeed in decommissioning this war, the Jewish people will be the victim of the front line of war as in World War II, this time together with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (only one thinks of how sharply people divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty person and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for global power at the beginning?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, will only elect their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-sensitive politician who is loyal to international bankers, who is making every effort to develop a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand to a global conflict, and which could lead to a destruction of the world economy due to Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide street of Hormus, over which 20% of global oil supplies are running.
In what light do the words David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-engine crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its vision, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial arrogants.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the little and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign to their right hand or to their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, whoever has a sense, who thinks about the number of the animal.
For it is a number of men, and his number is six hundred and sixty."
The film Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamic students occupied the US Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the extradition of the crashed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had preserved the patronate over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, because this would have seriously damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime was forced.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been held by the Algerian government.
The destiny of the hostages at home was a wave of solidarity and anti-iran moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the United States a small victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six embassy workers escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to hide their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports as members of a film team who allegedly visited the country's film locations for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert on "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in special journals, press conferences were held, and the fictive production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several movie genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politithriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no big differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overshooting.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the board, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck succeeded in a remarkable resumption of his career.
From a smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third film after the Crimea No child play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Afflecks that is not playing in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from Hollywood's standard.
But Affleck proves this feeling also in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually taken place - the entrance sequence of the embassy is very impressive in its overarchingness, yet gives the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the history moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team also in fictive scenes (the false film staff on a basar in Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But with the few he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality something - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threating crisis at the airport in Teheran is turned off by a telephone in America, or the persecution hunting on the start-up track, seem somewhat tailored).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to have too much action to show in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses a bit of power. It is a film that can be followed with some interest and the design and the retro-style that reminds a thriller from the 70s.
However, he is very enthusiastic.
However, as a reminder of a living piece of history until today and as proof of how exalted the ideas of all-powered and all-knowing secret services are, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for exploding airballons, bananas and circus
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who calls an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has decided to organize the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea led us to the recent EU's plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women is among the absurdities nominated.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they represent objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Other incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulations include, inter alia, the binding mixing of bioethanol into fuels which are naturally harmful, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cows, which this year became significantly more expensive because of eggs.
In the past, criticism also yielded the actual ban on the use of the term "butter pot" or the ban on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that trade and industry lobby whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to implement the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests were also concerned that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU should be at least 14 cm long and should not have "crowding anomalies".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it would only harmonise the inconsistent national standards that would impede trade.
The EU's fruit and vegetable standards have already been stimulated against the resistance of some countries to point out that the previous Directives would lead to waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the last year’s EU regulation, which, according to airballons, must be provided with the indication that children under the age of eight are not allowed to blow the airballoon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study, which, according to airballons, is the leading cause of children’s suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market rods.
Curiose Infarctions are also available at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive concerning European officials themselves - everyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic in Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Lass Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the area of a Member State, in addition to the absurdities.
The EU thus established the maximum volume of food stocks that could be held on the day of our accession to the EU in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom preserves, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were, of course, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged because we don't have a sea.
We will apply for refund from the EU," said then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereals harvest had been very high and the state stocks had been overfilled as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU, according to Palas, should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funds for applications for grants offered to municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should in particular be funds for the preparation of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced to negotiate the budgets of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although after six years of struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvariky", the national room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The term Rum may only be used for products made of sugar cane distillate, not for products made of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, in the society of world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmaschink, the Karlsbader Zweeback, carp from Pohořelice and Třebo.
With an EU brand, the Pardubics can breeze the Lebkuchen or the Hořic rolls.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how do you come to the idea of candidateing for the President's office?
It's not about me being a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without any problems, I would not candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40 years old, independent and partial, I have no other way to influence things but to apply for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you made it and then went on the way to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back?
I have told myself all the time that I will begin the fight about the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I made this clear and said that I would be candidate for the office of President if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate for this.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a people in the bar and in front of the television, but that we will put down everyone who wants to change something.
The media who want to rob one's honour and confuse the freedom of the word with freedom will come to this end.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would donate journalists or that I was counselor of Ji★ Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have embarked on the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive asset statements of over 20 million kronor.
You have to change laws for this purpose.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can put forward legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have committed myself to ensuring that the guide remains a free business, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it will be deliberately rejected, and that will only stop the population.
As an independent non-participant, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawers and party dogs I can take from every party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, people seem to see me rather on the left.
But for me this right-left thought is completely irrelevant.
It's important for me that we move on.
It is not about me whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
At some point I publicly support every good approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like anyone calling you a populist.
But do you not confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you would like to approach this.
It can be called populism for my sake, but all the proposals I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have keywords.
And that will not make you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to the people for long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to establish the substantive and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors in law.
And then the respondents would have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality that points to misfortunes can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With politics I have just started and I have just tried to find support for my programme for the majority.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds like we should save Okamura the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can't do anything alone, so I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to apply for the Senate as well.
I spoke, for example, with Radim Jančura, who, however, refused for overload of work.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who discovered the fraud in the trade of light fuel oil.
I started my candidateship with the condition that people are deeply unsatisfactory, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district heads.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to check the past of every potential party member, nor have I the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property statements, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated to be about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and an Škodu superb worth about one million, and then I have a few million more on my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked his driving in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't raise too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the salary alone; for example, I couldn't fund my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't apply for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your results?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my alternate will become the managing director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would put my business completely off.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in the head - in the example of spijkenisses and the recently built Buchberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the street side.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "But, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what else we need today to do.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man goes to one of these old-style libraries today voluntarily, isn't he?
Spijkenisse, a barely necessary sleeping city in front of Rotterdam's gates, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest educational rate in all of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictive bridges shown on the euro notes as pretty pinky concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the ruler of statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam's Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the beautiful bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical constructions, took the matter with usual tranquility and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a glimpse in the face.
And while the jury was still doomed to look around and shake with the axis, the frightened Maas stapled his exquisite contribution of the size into a pyramid and finished his actionistly supported speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
That is he, my proposal for the Buchenberg von Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive mountain was scattered.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the faceless small town rectors, who had no longer to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a ugly town hall, behind which white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to The Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheese locke.
While there is a lift that leads through the mountain massiv, the true space and reading rejoices open up when climbing the topography on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking out for park bank, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the book boards are standing along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic space configuration on our heads and stole the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Buchberg is well used: In the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology centre.
A special pleasure are the black book shelfs, which are once walls, once beams, once stitches.
Optics, haptics and smell are strange.
Even inflicted architects and construction engineers shake the head whether the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Troubrost, project manager at the town of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, one day, we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Friesland farm.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimeter thin plastic sheet is used as a root material in plants and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it is mature for the blockage waste.
For the library, the tiles - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters of thick plates.
Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is coloured into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bissl for new cars and a bissl for sports shoes.
After 105 steps, you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 metres long hike, you will be rewarded in the Literature Café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all for the correct humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but in spite of the many glass surfaces, this house is a preview project in the field of ecology," says Troubrest.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass crash, the sun even on sunny days only seems shortly inside.
The wide wooden adhesives that stand across the glass façade serve as a estimation and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest of them do full-automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial scepticist from the IT industry, has already drove the way to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Buchenberg as the spijkenisse's "length overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to give a book from his personal estate.
This is intended to fill the optical gaps in the library that is not yet fully equipped - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has begun.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just to decorate.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the king's discipline, which is referred to as the identity foundation of the professional Jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literature history.
She may be as young and untrained as well.
This is finally a point of approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing this at a narrow diplomacy level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for the observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin contained itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy, which was so-called managed by the US, to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to add that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still in their role, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean in fact from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the United Nations vote?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to put the public, but also the elites in front of the Arab countries.
It certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on it either, that's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German reflections.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not think this was as dramatic as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for this.
It signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
There are various opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama in secret has quite a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so much enthusiastic about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the EU's main partners on the other?
I think that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead they must drive things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, even because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself in the role of important international players - does Germany want to take a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still find it difficult to lead?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, this is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a larger role, different anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to various neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant for them and makes it much more unpleasant - it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly explore the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name officially registered in China is hidden behind it, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the actual names do not complain.
And even then it is not clear if they get right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, specializing in protection violations in Fernost.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to register their trademarks.
Thus from Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you let Prada-Kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the brand Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese world champions are in copying and injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are multi-storey shops that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
But Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of the guilt
"This is business harmful, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is watered, the sole setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the sectors concerned go to millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is the third largest luxury product market and the fastest growing market with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year.
However, deletion of dubiose entries in the trademark register is difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be withdrawn, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected appeals because after the long duration of the contested name had become "markettreality".
If the claimant has a bad luck, he even had to pay the plagiator because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pumper cleaner.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against aftermathmen from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few staff and space facilities.
Last year, however, you would have returned from "the emergency situation in the course of work to normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases had been completed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still awaiting completion in the Office.
To deal with it costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row China lists new applications worldwide, the Authority informs.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs on average 1280 Yuan or 160 Euros.
To deal with it is a lot of costs, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has fought a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that the illegal manufacture of imitated motor parts was lifted.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Mark Freudenberg.
This has been missed, since in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, President of the Management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO also rejected the objection of Munich.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight until today.
You have to watch hellfully
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified as if the company archive had had to look through hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg on the other side offered in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to weaken back to Europe.
That's when imitators secure unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has been abandoned by the Group for a long time, yet it was able to reject registration.
"You have to watch out hellfully," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, rather, as Wentzler says, foreigners should " register everything that is in some way safe, even in China".
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the reverse license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in this segment.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tastes, and in Swasiland, AIDS orphans are delighted about it.
The story of a connection that crosses far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men'slippers are looking for the tactic on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - disturb, disturb and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hope, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his smoothly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tastes a new song.
The 50 singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each chors voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Helping Self-Help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people around the world, which estimate Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Control Programme.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the Voices for Africa was found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a paternity.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The bantu language flowing can no one speak in this room, but can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been exercising songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes brings them back to where they originate: in the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are affected by the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the smallest thing that Swasiland suffers from is the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
The population hardly assumes cuts of male precutive skin, which are shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40 percent of people in Swasiland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, dying with the middle of thirty is no rareness.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only lacking parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
If you don't have a school degree, you don't have a chance in a poor country.
At the beginning it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him to have a warm meal every day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which since then almost professionally takes care of the AIDS whispers in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydies and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral TTIs are HIV, human pappilomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Filts and crates are part of the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Trippers occur especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydiae infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), trippers and human pappilomavirs are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - yet about 20 per cent of HIV reinfections account for this group.
Chlamydien infections are much more common among young people than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Human pappilomavirs are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled more than 3698 diseases in 2011 from 1697 diseases in 2001.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, urination disorders, rash, abdominal pain, and bubbles or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer a hundred percent protection.
For part, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and delayed.
Through patenships, donations and, not least, the gagens that the choir sings throughout Germany, come together a lot.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and enforceable woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares for the orphans to live well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear in time for school education every day.
Whoever has no more, comes into the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman, who is paid by the club as well as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because, as clearly the disease is in the whole country, it is most likely to be silenced.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned form of life is due to the rapid spread of the HI virus in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would be available at every corner," says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two, three years through South Africa and sings songs full of wrath, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many at the southern summit of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of whites, singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only the mood and joy, but has already ripped off a few tears from some griming border soldiers.
The journey is always leading to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their paternal children.
Although you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," the people say there.
And if you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the test room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shine there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is nearest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" journal.
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently in the shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that were hit on the Mercury.
No one brings the find of ice, however, with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to find out how water and other elements of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small eyeholes in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles behind Neptun around the sun, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This image section of an infrared recording of the top telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are recognized as blue points, more difficult to identify the pink "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope top in the star image of Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shining glut of a dying star has recorded the top telescope of the Nasa.
The doughnut-shaped ring consists of material that the star dragged out in the death process.
In the huge trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Nasa's top telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Plejaden star crowd, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the mere eye.
However, with the telescope the colours are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star picture.
His resemblance to an earthly continent gave this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.

One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on colouring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light years away trifid fog in the image shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, three-parted), as dark dust stripes the glowing heart of the star birthplace three parts.
In the star picture Snake carriers have photographed astronomers the forefronts of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are being scratched together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not have technical abbreviations, he may call them South Firecycle by her nickname.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a section from the Iris Nebel in the star picture Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
In this star nabel is the brightest group of youngest stars of our milk road.
The star weighs always produce new youngsters.
Also these stars wolves, connected with the rosette fog, are constantly producing new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only a short time after the urnall when hydrogen was found mainly in the universe.
Our insights into the All: The main telescopes
The telescope should have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become increasingly deeper - and the insights they provide are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into the universe equal to over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Advantage of the favourable construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its speciality: the high light collectivity.
In spite of a relatively low mirror diameter, it is sufficient to reach the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the whole thing for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing performance.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors all his name.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should comprise sat 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest of 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer equal to two mirrors each with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, next to them, is still looking into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope will be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from the All provide the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already provided images of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the last launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board a Ariane5 rocket in the Alert at the earliest of 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared head has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also the southern pole of Mercury ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messengers are far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades indicated that there is on the Mercury ice.
The Messenger-Sonde, the first to circle the Mercury, launched in 2004, now has certainty to the scientists.
Drinking butter daily - and getting 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysh mountains is called wild Romantic.
The small bus runs over the curve-rich road, past densely forested hills, shrinking rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here the Caucasian group of Talys lives, not much known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town prospered with too heavy Soviet architecture, which does not want to fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, too difficult is the way from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-purpose.
The vast wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Sustainability, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita documented by about eight dozen talys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child still born
However, the controversial star of the museum is the Shepherd Ελλάδαirali Müslümov, who should have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he would have born another daughter.
So, when he was a child, did Ελλάδαirali Müslümov count for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high ages in Central Asia.
"There are noticeably many high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men living."
However, due to lack of documentation, there is no scientific evidence about age, especially because there were no registers of persons.
Every day melted butter
The fact is, however, that people around Lerik often reach Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why are so many high-aged people living here in the south?
The Azerian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
On the other hand, Museum Director Fatulayeva believes that it's food.
But that the calorieful diet of the Talys is supposed to be so healthy that they love meat, bread and mainly milk products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not appear to be very plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik.
With its 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butterfoot that rolls her tirelessly.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are long-standing grandparents.
Two little children, too, are jumping around.
In the kitchen you prepare tea for guests served in the typical, buffalo-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in rows and limbs, under her towels she hides long, dark blonde heads that proudly reveals her son to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always only eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For my whole life, I haven't bought food for a single time in the supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the time after World War II.
But everything became better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the roar.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the robbery.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old ones.
230 Manat (approximately the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local circumstances a sum of which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-standing son is also right: "The old ones enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing events in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with sharia as a basis is strongly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on the state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but most importantly to the Christian heads, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and sactuaries.
For they all, so far hopelessly conflicted in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a godly state on the Nile of the graces of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He had, as Mohammed Mursi said almost apologising, temporarily circumcised the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers to "saving the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who is carrying a doctoral degree from the American University of South California, really wants to save, are the Egyptians, the world is not fully aware of this.
Should the Judicial be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were squeezed by the 100-head Constitutional Assembly, which was dominated by Islamist, are partly worrying in a nightly 15-hour parforcer.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that the case law is based on the "Principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is an interpretation matter and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: In all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation in all Sunni Islam, must be attracted.
That doesn't have to, but it can mean that the clergy supervises the legislation, which in fact would result in the dismissal of the judiciary.
Many things in the draft text are interpreting matters.
Also problematic: civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to oppress oppositionals.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The State should also, as it says, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values".
This is legally so unscrupulous that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature using this article.
In the clear text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article expressly stipulates equality between men and women.
To this end, another one prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his Messengers to insult or slander.
But what is an insult and how it should be obeyed remains unclear.
Dubios also mutes the wording that "insults of people" is prohibited.
Is there enough of a president's cartoon or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation, as so much in the draft that Mursi is for signature and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has formed itself for weeks against the overpower of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual intrace on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring the Charter to falls even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place in the presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prize winner and ex-chairman of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft constitution belonged to "the waste mountain of history".
Through short news service Twitter he attacked the followers of Mursis to want to lead a "puzzle against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and fall him," said Opposition Jasser Said.
"We aren't tired yet, the blood of our brothers isn't yet rebuilt," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Quran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood, for its part, blew to counter-demonstration, but not on the Tahrir place, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the Cairo University.
Many hidden women and followers of the salafists took part and cried, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called on Mursi, "Sever the country!" and said, "The Quran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir place, on which everything began, would have raised state like a civil war.
Mursi's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had made a very clear statement.
Now it is time for the people to decide at the ballot which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights doesn't even happen"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would have actually gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights attorney and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, jailed for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi power extension to all three authorities in the state dismissed the lawyer.
These measures are eclating violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
" Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto eliminates it," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who looks at the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You bear a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with local appetite for pretty badly smelling fish?
Take a selection of overmature cheeses.
They are placed in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And give them a week.
You have to imagine the nasal drowning smell of rockfish, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-rich trout, which is fermented in water for up to a year depending on how stinky you would like to have its fish.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians are streaming to a party here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this really very gifting specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire guard, but as a so-called "Rakisk-General" also organizes the festival.
People around us eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the rockfish," Havard says.
The spirit drink can extinguish the smell.
I'll cost you a few bucks.
If you avoid bringing the rocky fish to the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options yet and fish was drunk in airproof water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter he was then removed after long fermentation and, undoubtedly, consumed with spirits humidified by alcohol.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and moved mainly to the United States.
Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not so much richer than Norway, emigrants flow.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important - an essential, although severely smelling part of Norwegian history.
It's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get it into the world press, and most people don't seem to bother it.
Here you still hate calling Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "Event of July 22".
Norwegians are making it hard to accept that someone in their peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, growth has been one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with ripe rockfish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the sparkling blue eyes.
We are a - as you say - careful people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very charming, we don't like splendour.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of industry revenues will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years to the world economic crisis, when all of them were thrown around with money that they had not at all had, Norway kept its wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And of course eat rockfish," she adds with uncomfortable laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
That's what a burger of the Elch is, and the juicy meat is going to me.
But in the evening the stink fish is back on the dining table.
The hotel, in which I stay, is one of several venues that organize a rockfish dinner where guests can vote for the best fish - or perhaps the most challenging fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-coated showmaster surrounded by plates with rockfish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What scores do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're crawling and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict dust of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his office, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges and mixed feelings of his people.
At present, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this city is always blocked, but on Monday a steel ring was built, which locks several important traffic routes into the capital and ensures chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential tie and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the departing government, Felipe Calderons has been able to prove economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Pena Nieto was the governor of his country of Mexico before he went to the top of his eyes with the U.S. president.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions on the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the distant small town of Valle del Bravo you will like to remember him.
The residents of the resort are responsible for the development of tourism and for the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that let Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement compared to the broken, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plakettes with his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive climate change museum.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressman for the Pena Nietos party.
In particular, as regards security and economics, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was revoked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition that the new President lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent state man, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways constitutes a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to combat the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large garbage depot, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is infamous for their violence and murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he has not at least addressed the problem of women's murders during his term of office adequately.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes from the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downtown, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body was washed," remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body stares had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana from the wall looks down on us. It is attached next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But exactly this, according to the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I'm a bitch, an unreststifter, a nerd.
They want you to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many shape errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's binding on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is the same as he was as Governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
The Attorney General claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The Attorney General contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks a rejection of the charges due to too hard conditions of detention
The liberated of the US army is accused of evading thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the Attorney General tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed to complain about the alleged abuse in military detention.
During a cross-interrogation in Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden Fein that documents on weekly visits that prison officers had made during Mannings nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not have any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross interrogation, which was held as a result of a defence request for the rejection of the charge - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the severe detention period - Manning had declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning completed the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he had placed under enhanced conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Finin asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "Amazing" and the treatment by the institution as a "very professional".
The forms, according to Fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concerns and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "No problems, and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal idea mentioned by him several months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to "prevent injury".
The military stated that it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the risk of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning announced his arrest and deportation to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was detained for almost two months before he was transferred to the prison of the Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had once become unconscious due to the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or the outside world had been burdensome.
"My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, together on this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to stay in motion because on the day it had been forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He had to sleep with light that ended up in his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was awakened so he turned back.
In January 2011, Mannings' lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had declared that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling during this counting.
At the interview on Friday, Manning announced that he had closed from a command of his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had declared that he was forced to sleep naked the night before. He would have tried before to show an official that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the union of his underpants or his flip flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said that his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his haat experiences and drastically reduce his detention if he is sentenced to the military court during his trial, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess guilty of lesser crimes, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the public prosecutor is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains at its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners kept under the highest safety measures in Quantico.
The accusations against Manning include the favour of the enemy, the illegal publication of secret information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the stealing of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with lifelong imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of heavy times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when inadvertentness became broad in me.
Signs refer to two waiting snakes: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Extranjeros").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to whom I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called Mexican all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italy".
Later, I chose Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or ties.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the serpent for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all those issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicons remain today with equally high probability in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block, as the European Union has done.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and resentable.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that in 1848 the United States came to Mexico and forced the country's leadership under a rifle held to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government officer only exercises mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans press on the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the path of war.
And yet the biggest challenge in Mexico is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about feelings?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or a grandparent - did not get a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark skin, untrained, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, have visited good schools and have received good jobs, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but in terms of our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership group do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this badly.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither part of the country nor part of the country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections with diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a temporary "ambassadorial" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press the political leadership to intensify its ties to Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, uncontrolled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans are playing a role in the way their family members were not treated until a long time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're mexicans than I thought.
Old combats, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
In the middle of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in shock and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time missiles from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israels have become part of these evils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the fatal patt situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems to be more than appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November persists, the struggles this week have strengthened the hard shots on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic Movement, which has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its grouping itself had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are caught in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim allies, has taken the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Rejoicing Hamas supporters believe that Israel forms an Islamic half-mond - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic embodiment could stand in front of the crash of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabitant and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region in a lasting way.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
On the other hand, the fraternity with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli Hardliner, on the other hand, makes a opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly committed to its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although missiles from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide offenders, not least thanks to the blocking facilities that enter the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal, but are constantly being expanded.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party joined an even more fighter group in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these behindlist Palestinians also hide and leave their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they not fire rockets just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the Hardliner will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defence facility is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi came together with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israel should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking vigorous steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an external impact
The right answer is those represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states where Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms delivery in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish State based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also help to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems like he was also inclined to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-term perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation on single cigarette packaging enters into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands
The first single cigarette and tobacco packaging laws worldwide have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green cover, which are also printed with drastic images, which show sick body parts and infants and children with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures once again, the only difference between the packs in the brand names printed in identical, small writings is from the coming Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's most stringent rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking with 26 will not start smoking with 99% probability even after.
"You can already see that young children understand the message that they are trying to apply to tobacco companies with their brand image," said Tanya Plibersek, Federal Minister for Health. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeits will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha by Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette tubing and silicon lids has risen enormously to cover intolerant packaging since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed the highest Australian court with their contestation of laws two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale and waits for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors and forced most dealers to no longer interpret cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising is switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but has no influence on international websites.
"Who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products, doesn't come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has observed an increase in experience reports about brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself the question: is this just a private person who finds such great pleasures in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes up a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are trading with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore her.
"You just take a cap and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, an operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city centre of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his shelves.
"Previously I took an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he obviously adds.
In a constantly electricized world it's nice to be bored even once
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane fell due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts too boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport half a day is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more academics and children's development experts are making boring than something positive.
When it goes after them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us nowadays are almost constantly staring at one or more screens, the benefits of boring are no longer beneficial to us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I will come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boring is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In fact, boring has a very long story," he says.
The walls of Pompeji are decorated with a Latin graffiti over boring, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boring.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor in psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, says the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boring as the experience of "willing to carry out a satisfactory activity but not to be able to do so" could be defined.
Sadness differs from apathy as a result of the fact that the person is not busy but wants to be.
However, there is no need for apathy to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists of a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with poor mood and the feeling that time passes only slowly".
Sadness can sound almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions could be related, boring people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boreweile in the aspect of attention", published in September in the special journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which the participant listened to a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volumes, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly listenable television said they felt more boring than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, could not find any reason for them and gave their difficulties to boring.
If you try to focus on a difficult or difficult task, the disorder of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you exercise a one-tone activity - "such as searching for defective products on a factory conveyor band, music can distract and help not feel bored."
In fact, he says, we know now that herums and critzels, often interpreted as a sign of boring, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hang around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored sometime - my late flight, a drowning speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are more boring than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found out that young people are becoming more boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external charms.
But in general teenagers are a rather stretched crowd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager seven to eight times a day with nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32% of adults were bored in school and doing their homework, whereas 23% indicated being bored if they weren't in school.
But only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson today, 21 years later, says that he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "the youth will feel particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my original question: Is boring healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and to fall down on gambling or drugs to relieve them - that have shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something else," said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If one is boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, television can make sense of happiness in the short term, but it will be a long - term fugitive.
So whoever is enough for his boring child to have an iPad, it can take it away from boring. However, it has not learned to talk or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to the other".
The child learns not only to talk, but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boring.
We should also not see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel well beyond the constant activity and technology seam.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring, but boring is the painful, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is damp."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for an offence that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some fewer marijuana bricks and a peep with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco he and some friends travelled by car in Lamar near Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was invited for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalry crimes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court order.
"We're being treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the unconscious weeks after the government's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for self-use, the response to hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for small possessions, which is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have announced that they will continue to follow existing marijuana likes and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana business from opening in their municipalities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are scratching their heads unfortunately.
They are waiting for guidance for the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug, with a deadline for 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case preceded by most states as regards the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the State's Supervisory Authority for Spirituous Beverages.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also constitutes the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not exist yet, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how to agree on the government's provision of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis shops around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's urban area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora, stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana-likes in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police will "from now on" not seek criminal charges for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations for medical marijuana growers and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorados, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana ownership, mainly in order to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 persons have to be charged with the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other delics.
"Our authority has the obligation to prosecute infringements at the time of the offence," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to abandon all outstanding ownership proceedings.
"I don't think I'll waste my time with enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a profound twilight among local officials with regard to the great green experiment at present.
District Attorneys are a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney, who represents the defendant in court for marijuana and speaks on the ground for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana.
"They have spent so much of their life persecuting persons for criminal purposes that they still cannot accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries treating smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national models for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and government officials are preparing for a period of legal sale, they are at the same time nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at the federal level.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has permitted the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to a large extent.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor of the Obama government, believes that although criminal officers are probably not going to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to sneak themselves into the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved moratoria for new marijuana business, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position in which we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment of law.
We judge according to what the community has decided and not according to what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was beaten from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to have a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the world's largest stamp of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the evening standard it was said I had gone because I had a problem with communions having sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson told me that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yes, it ran because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been shocked only for one reason - a reason that in this supposed weight of enlightenment seemed so narrow and cruel: my now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatchers and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers under similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them demanded equal rights protection last week, benefiting gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are "often actively isolated, attacked and declared unwanted" because of their political views.
They demand a place in the Equality Committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as excentric and Neonazis.
It showed, among other things, the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and procured with silver-coloured suit and silver-worked hob.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are considered as "Syndbooks for the introduction of higher school fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing links trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever having met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and historian in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said she had observed an increasing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred on the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the University had voted in favour of not giving Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary title due to reductions in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have scared Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students meet and meet the tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I experienced that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even took part with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatization of the government and the rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wooden spaces of the tutorium.
At my first of these events, I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been caught on what was supposed to happen.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime died), "translate the first paragraph."
I knocked on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake tea, and quite forsaken.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?", he asked me.
The other students kicked.
In my eyes, tears blew up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your leisure - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt kicked me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That evening, I was sitting at college alone at dinner when someone hit me slightly on my shoulder.
It was a second year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be disturbed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, that's why it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory First Semesters pretend to be a follower of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to put myself in.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
An academic beginner in philosophy, politics and economy who ironically visited Eton College, which was a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How did Tories have sex?", one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet similar people only after the darkness breaks in?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me stretched out in front of my spiritual eye to a ugly fire of adoration and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and had written speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and smallly, and rejected him for his Marxist-determinist perspective of history.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began to ride between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unfaithful.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do that, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always showed unfit manners.
His moist eyes blurred.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being necked.
It would break my heart if you left.
exhausted by my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had given up the pressure and denied his convictions.
During a tutorial the next week, where another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke out of shame, I admitted that my parents had been subjected to brainwash, and called them "old idiots".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes, my lovers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a crying sleepy cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and maliciousness in a educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that did not only produce 14 Tory Prime Minister, but hid behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought until now.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
At the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture were made up by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but without his distinguished clientele could not have been written.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the stiff and far-reaching world of nobles.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be to be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most outstanding aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
To be in love with the nobles does not have to be of a disadvantage.
"At least they don't show up their chickens on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful fame from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close to forgotten beautys such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the fashionmaker's charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, at food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "Top-Model", which started their career at the Haute Couture Week in 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes from fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes..
Mode View of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre walkway, which suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walk to admire a dreamy "audienz" which bears Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in La Notte, or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion puppets, names like that of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria von Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg are shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I am attracting him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s it finally came to pass.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my custodian, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a dragged top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening clothes "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "king" of fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his closest women) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-metre swivel.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honorary legion, accumulates Garavani as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his careful and perfect appearance," says D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was fabulous; the time leaves no traces of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the stiff, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the volcano of Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, he has to climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas emitted from the earth is fixed in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kg in total, he transportes them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sparkling stone paths.
Although it is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that rises up to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle speed, with the need to keep the balance and set their steps carefully so that they do not run out and fall down.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur they deplete.
Upstairs, they walk the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiredly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mine company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the occurrences in the volcano and (no better said) its workers, for which it pays 662 Indonesian rupies (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This will then sell them for 10,000 rubies (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of iron woods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamics and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we normally wear 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupies (3,8 euros) for each route," Anto explains, which usually makes three routes a day.
For each route he takes three hours, which he has finished completely, but at the end of the day he has 138.000 rupies (11.5 Euro) together.
But what looks like an unfortunate wage for such an inhuman effort is the triple of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rubies (1.2 euros) are paid a day in the coffee harvest and the average monthly income of two million rubies (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupies (6,2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they were Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hates often and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
For three years the 27-year-old Anto has put his life at Kawah Ijen at risk, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hates often and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for fulfilling his dream.
"I will work here for two years, because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathic and intelligent young man who is punished by life could work as a tourist guide, a waitress or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a tragedy.
He divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the dark shines blazingly.
Challengeing the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur depletion to save costs, and supplies no equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid according to weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupies (2,5 Euro) supplement per photo device required by the guards of this natural park together with the entry fee of 15,000 rupies (1,2 Euro) from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulphur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick in the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed themselves from the weight of the body.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only more able to wear 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks through a goat path between the buzz to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth far where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulphur carrier with his 30 years.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation on generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden ele at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens blame for having no children, on the career, stress and the costs of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: Let us fulfil our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertising for mintbons, but yet - or precisely because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as "Screw a bao" (laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has turned the video, maintains the hope that the advertising will reach in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When reproducing, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (speed flirts).
Possibly many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not do something as creative as we can to address this problem, such as compose a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue easily are Singapore's government.
Every year, she spends $1,300 for political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has not been successful so far.
Singapore is a rich high-tech city state in southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to his national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporens get children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have far more options and priorities in terms of life objectives, except to marry and form a family," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of single and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
At the same time, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentments among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the barely cassed xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in birth rates has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to check the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lives of the lonely and that they discourage construction companies from building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the Real Estate Company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This leads to that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer directions, which have been prevented from being able to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could help to increase the national birth rate, talks with the Singaporens working in the financial quarter will not have much effect.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and also education are expensive, so it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me it's important to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their career, stress and costs of ownership and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting children - the government can do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where you have the right to protection from any type of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he announces on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" at the personal level and "on the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the meaning of "privat" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful images or images of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not from me, or from someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them also the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added his friends list.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made statements to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"When someone intrudes me or asks for it from me, I simply remove it from my user account," he admits.
José joined Ask after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was extorted in a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
He then explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he was unsympathic to me or if I wanted to wipe one thing out of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the holder of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University, and the author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we demand that they have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be selective if it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to think.
"Saying to you that they shouldn't do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some ways: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them the understanding that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educator adviser, commented that it was essential for parents to read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and had to be theoretically signed by the seven present governors.
Efe repeatedly tried to obtain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources at the State and Presidential Office initially informed that they would hand it over after the clause, but subsequently declared that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian Government for some time.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief explanations to the press.
Journalists had limited access to information on the summit at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists were received by the press speakers of some of the governments of the Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was disseminated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala declaration and not the official document on the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the IIIrd Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong press call, the so-called Lima declaration, which had been announced before, was not published.
On the ASPA's official website you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court to bring about a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which began on Monday in The Hague, initiating the Lima against Santiago, to listen to both sides of the pleadings.
"We will follow and execute the judgement of the differences that we present to this International Court of Justice," said Humala and his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that complies with international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and subjects itself to international courts," Piñera adds and greets Humala with a hand pressure before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice was made after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to be subject to the judgments of the International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the cessation of President Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
The hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the discussions in the morning and concluded the summit in Lima shortly after lunch.
The Head of State left the final document, which indicated that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between South American countries over an investment amount of a total of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He informed that measures would be promoted to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised cross-border crime, as well as to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and effectively in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphing trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial links in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvians, located on the quarries of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which were to ensure better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its resumption in the Union of South American nations," which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbouring relations was another aspect emphasised at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before he began attending the regional meeting, that he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday, in order to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will be as civilized and respectfully treated as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present with the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defense Ministers of the Block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is chaired at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the public television in Peru that the Europeans "did themselves in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "is now practically a country of origin."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that promotes the Member States of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) in order to reduce the influence of the Angelsaxon States and to take into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said as a claim to political asylum, which Ecuador has granted the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not deceive his principles, but had respected his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at that time there had been "founded assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that its procedure would not be complied with."
He also criticized the Swedish justice, who had asked him to interrogate him in his territory for alleged sexual crime, while "Swedish law allowed this through a video conference that could have been conducted through the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that there was a danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not serious," said Ecuador's Head of State.
However, there is a danger that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for asylum granted to Assange since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been discussions with London in order to find a solution for WikiLeaks' locked-up founder.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European legal authorities , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, runs a number of proceedings in various European institutions," he said.
And "if Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden interviewed Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, as it allowed Swedish case law and in other cases, the problem was over.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "the moderateness, the evil intention and the lies that deter the free expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and extortion," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador on the fact that such journalists were no longer "managed by bankers or hegemonic and spit-citizen countries", and preceded that he would "intensify the revolution in order to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism must "remain hard and not allow any opportunism and no one to be legally dressed" because it "was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers that the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which favoured the maritime authority of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, is "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American State.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of disputes on the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries undertake to adopt the judgment, even if it is very difficult."
With regard to the possibility that he would be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he said that he saw this option "with much optimism and joy, although it sometimes is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but in such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was me who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to comply with this responsibility," he said.
If I was to win, it would be my last period as President, then I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just talked to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he traveled there for a scheduled routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It doesn't mean in any case a relapse in the health condition of President Chávez," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador today took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of AIDS death today is a too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried "to weaken without noticeable success".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic himself avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to an asshole."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
The Specialist for Infectious Diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death penalty, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of immune system damaged by individuals at the start of treatment, and that there were greater opportunities that were not drug-dependent: up to 30 years for a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a census of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, the aforementioned statements mean that whoever gets HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 in this sense "can easily become 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this specialist.
In order to correctly adjust this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people died of AIDS has decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is still right that 60 per cent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the emergence of AIDS.
In 2011 255 people died alone in Jalisco, and by May this year there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why are people still dying of it?
I do not think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we had no medical care problems. The problem is that people come in advanced condition because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late phases of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnostics are needed, so massive detection tests must be offered to all those who are required."
This proposal is accepted by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio who allowed his test to be carried out in a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even had the caposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumour), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then prefer to drop three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, exercise sports and take the medications.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I'm living a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to inspire with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the laden table
There are big holes between the health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At the places for this purpose, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk of new infections.
"What do you need it?" is a widespread question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system that do not want to expedite young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorientation of this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the laden table, but in the output equipment in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether conservative would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; the best thing is to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he pointed it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
Nationally, the state is at the fourth place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and at the 13th place of HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for each registered case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognize the restructurement of the Vitro Group's debts achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unfortunate precedent is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of Stars and Stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas leads to the undue suspension of the Mexican companies of confiscation of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to US bankruptcy law, the Appeal Court of the Fifth Circuit with its seat in New Orleans first states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings for companies with cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations model law on the harmonization of international trade law has been established for this purpose, with the American Law Institute being used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the Group's companies were confirmed by the Institute of Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
It is also right that after the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the Geier-Fonds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent versus 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which caused hits to the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same appeal court in order to allow the vote to take place in plenary, that is, from all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare objection, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher instance, will be lodged by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing in this case is that the court has left a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Conkurses, and pointing out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency guaranteeing the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded caramboles: a blow for Vitro and the country.
General balance
After the announcements made by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not progress for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (the Pilot Association) finally made progress.
The application referred to by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of the disability of justice.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to deduct from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE from the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administradora Profisional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the south-east to resist the monumental establishment which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Since the government has failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain the terms and conditions under which the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had ignored the possibility because it considered them as a violation of the free expression in social networks.
Homex long-term
In seeking to pay long-term liabilities without impaired short-term liabilities, the building company Homex brings up more than 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four same emissions that promise interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of competition
Founded from the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a company group called Competival was founded, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummer of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, either as a player of lower classes, as a player of the first national league, as well as as a representative and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as President of the Basketball Association.
"For my life, I set up many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, Chief Executive Officer of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-business leader or CEO of the club.
"These were my best years I've enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of the eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether it was Managing Director, co-business leader or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in turn from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the discard specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would make another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already at a distance, because he already stood at the top of the union in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, in which we took fourth place, which should have been bronze if not this Canadian arbitrator, who let us repeat the last game for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this world championship group in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, as they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
In the team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which made us great pleasure, was the one of the 1995 vorolympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner as a replacement for the blocked players because of the events at the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was definitely Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking his career into account in the various lungs in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like Leo Arill's work very well.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the National Team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce play only in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table-officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was world-famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R".
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Oil Magnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birth town Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over years.
In 1995, a malignant tumour was detected in his liver and he was subjected to a transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known as a nice guy on television in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Awesome Jeannie" of NBC.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets an attractive "djinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedies who were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the enchantingly abominable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot on J.R.?", the expectation for an episode of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in betting houses.
The series thus reached a record of audiences at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who transformed "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to present her as a prostitute if she didn't leave the city, but others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: a misleading businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to show his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here the dear citizen rests J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
On Friday, Victoria Principal, meditator of the original series, remembered Hagman as a "normal personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts for us who have had the happiness to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success in the TNT television channel a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informed the broadcaster.
Warner or TNT did not immediately explain how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatres at the beginning of the 1950s, after which he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many famous things have their place of residence.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything I thought it could harm someone or in any way harm him," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplantation, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxiety patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as, "No fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long reverse counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21, many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the following two months: the Destroying Hurricane Sandy, whom some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as an increasing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe that the Apokalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever existed," Charmé said this week to the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
If someone analyzes what has happened today in the world as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses about the "end of the world" of this semester, which should be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so we can always keep the option to keep the course again in case the world fails," restall said.
Despite the "declining" the students have to study, create projects and participate in audits.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out in the morning of the Apocalypse, so the students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for high average students, which filled itself with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places left.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Chambers for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"Nothing I have heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less than one professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back centuries when people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherwhere, people don't think that," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days had been spoken of by the last court over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "the people immediately thought of a new date" or philosophy about that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period that the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several people said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world".
"Maybe I call a couple of friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
