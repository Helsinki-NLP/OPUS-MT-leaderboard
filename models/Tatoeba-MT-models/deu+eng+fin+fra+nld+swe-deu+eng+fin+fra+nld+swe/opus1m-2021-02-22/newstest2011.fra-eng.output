What is going to happen? CSSD does not know Voldemort or bakery in Prague.
The new CSSD elected at the capital mayor seems to have to overcome a real language barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS members.
The Newspaper Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the CSSD municipal council, namely whether they know the greed that has been born in the last few years in the mayor, when they were the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream launched in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was surprising that it was discovered that the new elected members did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a fasting in Prague politics responded to Lukas Kaucky, the chosen to cultivate at the test of the vocabulary of the "sponsor".
And with regard to the political veteran, the chosen Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf train".
"This is the only expression that you suggest to me that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the clay.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the ODS Pre-ectoral Congres, the editorial has chosen 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague mayor.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry, "feed nerve", "the capital treason" and "seal".
Three of the elected were agreed for the quiz, the quatrium Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not answer the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek completely refused the test.
"I don't take care of these things at all here and how fun the representatives of the citizen's democracy are: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand ourselves in our programs," he responded.
As has already been heard, the chosen Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky and immediately adds, "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay me a language course," he's joking.
Not only the Matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, knows that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
Both social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "Going to bakery".
"It's, I think, going to a business," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexicon of work in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it seems that we really don't have something like this."
"We say the names are sometimes used in abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socialist Party, who the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that way," says Karel Brezina about the surnames.
The Daily Current.cz tested the name and it works.
The chosen Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the fraud during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the small game".
The names are also the only ones that allow the social-democrats to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another surname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in law of matraque" appears to recall that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his title as a doctor in law of JUDr. at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of the "orches", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witchcrafts have common features.
They are rather part of the old generation, can't work for health reasons, are free and have no child.
The one who becomes "sorcious" is isolated not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this fate."
"Young women are also not judged to be healthy because they are involved in work and childbirth," says a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help to limit hunting to witchcraft.
The case contains a "hic".
" More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," warned Die Standard daily about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbour to Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals claim it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for the ritual onctions burned to the contact of the woman.
The oil burned, apparently, when the team wanted to "discard the bad mind" of the woman.
Isolation of "sorceries" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always posed a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is struggling to reduce witch hunting, Gambia was not later than last year even seen the President himself participating.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt of witchcraft who, apparently, had participated in his death and strived by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from Guinea who came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of the President's police and personal guard, men and women randomly chosen in Gambia villages," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
At the farm, the prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bakal's tenant: The poles warm, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out by the door of the customer centre of RPG Bouy of the "Chicle Baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was wearing a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son who is in the process of purging a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500, the son will have to settle from next year for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works with solid fuel," fingers on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I've still signed," he explains with anger and half-returned motive.
The Citizens' Association of Apartments BoutyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One says this, the other says something else" by browsing the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Update.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of the four of the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Just next to the door holds a guard of a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is turned on on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with a number come out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number already begins to illuminate on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to find out about the rent, but the new rent does not seem to affect people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems, such as demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people with more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have received mail with the new lease contracts in their mail box since about mid-November.
RPG Bouty offers them rental increases from 15 to 38 per cent.
the special access point for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"he has been working for almost a week, so it's still on the test," answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the shop when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and old minor apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local topic.
The Vice-President of the Parliament, who originated in the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats, reported this in a fairly sustained manner before the elections and now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a porn board in the toilets, relieving the man mentioned in the introduction.
However, mainly, according to employees, pensioners come to be sure that they will receive a refund on the new rent price if they sign now as the RPG has promised in a special offer.
It is a refund of half of the rent amount that other tenants will receive who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" link on Havirovaska Street is really not aggravated by the questions.
"From the 360 customers who arrived yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the shop.
And yet RPG pores both on its website and in the windows of individual rental interviews when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will take the decision.
'These are not threats but only information about the unique and legitimate way of acting legally,' says RPG on its website.
"Here no one goes to court," thinks one of RPG Bouy's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center is right to him.
"I have 13000 crowns of retirement and I have 5000 crowns to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media calls for no sign and therefore people are waiting," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Bouy, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, Director of the residential portfolio of RPG Bouy, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase of the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG has been able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years of 2011 to 2014 that is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the wheelchairs of the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns not less than 31200 apartments, or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be up to a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Bouy promises that the deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase of rents have priority.
The mother school is also part of offices that included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he would also have a mini mother school with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The Arch. Design. Architectonic Projects Company, whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini maternal business school since the first designs of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially from age to age, and it was important for women architects and project managers to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced time contracts, the mother school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
It is the employees of Arch.Design. themselves who have imagined this mother school and with the support of the management they have been able to obtain a staffing from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini maternal school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational human resources programme and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding allocations (Czech krona 2.8 million) they have been able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years ensure qualified staff as well as start-up.
After using the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to make the mini mother school operate on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was the Economy Rating company that helped to apply for staffing.
Children's care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a nurse are taking care of children all day.The children can go to the mother's school without age limitation, but they are over three years old for most.
As this is a "mini-money school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more to replace.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is doing individual care and education, the program of the mini-school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not only play there but also provide quality education - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of delay to go to a school far from the place of work of the parents.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural loyalty relationship between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house is still fascinating after 100 years. Take a look into the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase at a spinal column of dinosaur and the balconies at open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname of House in bone.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade resembling scalps and curves everywhere, this is all that is ypic for the Art Nouveau d'Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal façade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation you can see geometry, pace and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colours is reinforced.
The rolling and torsion of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood reproduces in wave the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the onion and the lamells.
The house Battlo, which sits in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another whole new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multiple housing house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for a representation apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the façade.
For the façade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo began with a successive cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises named the hot house just after its finish because of its organic forms "the House in bone".
Others, in view of the specific window opening mechanism, called it "the house that slaps".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the boss of Catalonia.
Other construction sculpture elements contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of then and did not allow itself to be hampered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the permit from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion the municipal council was horrified and requested changes.
For example, municipal council members did not like the building pillars emptied on the public trottoir.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase by which you can access an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new façades with a non-traditional towel and two floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard and with the wells of lights are decorated.
The game with two colours gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than darkness that, on the contrary, absorbs the sun rays.
The House Casa Battlo, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a profitable company and extended the field of visits to common spaces and towers including rooftop terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist cards holders have 20% discounts.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a sommier: women have other criteria than men.
No oestating frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and the sommier give a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must be complemented harmoniously to enjoy a concrete user.
During the choice several things are crucial:the weight, size, age, health status and the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the sommier will be placed is also important.
Typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses do not sleep continuously are not suitable because they "heat" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they keep the moisture. Moisture can also form there.
The habit is also crucial in the choice.
The person who passes the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a sparkling layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all hokeyists coming back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, their feet and their ribs, they needed mattresses with a sparkling layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, which therefore take poor "information" of the joints and skin," Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in drained furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, for example, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pressures you and you won't go back into the night as after a hard game.
You're just asleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against the squarrels.
For the choice of the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of 180cm size therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each one bed with two seats should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should put your hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded bends. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-Mattressiers and Decorators, who has been devoted for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching it in specialized schools.
For one bed with two seats each needs its own sommar and mattress, so be careful during the squat to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only be able to climb the sommar at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of form and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"If you touch or sit on the mattress, you must not feel the springs," Heléna Prokopova warns.
Each mattress demands a well-defined type of sommier.
The sleeping bed, when the mattress and the sleeping bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it must not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night you usually sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and stuck) seam.
For this purpose, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But it's all his but.
And for this, an experience advice from the seller: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though today it is common to make coatings with glider closure for the whole, that is, after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a stiff board in your bed instead of a sommar?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the plank (if there is no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-positioned lambs with 14/18 lambs, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut) are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattresse with more lambs, 28 and above, where the lambs are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, no spring mattresses should be taken because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, you can also install what is called a shoulder bend.
This is a special connection of the lamells that allows to put pressure or even inclin the lame so that the sleeper's shoulder "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", this is really an important thing.
This is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for "masculins" have begun to use a melting area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at hip level.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or plate sommars with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and reduces tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (great and swollen air) on good mattresses and sommar, the "more" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tip must only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder bend of the sommier or the area stirred into the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first straw-based and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also bio mattress.
Petroleum raw materials from which polyurethane is manufactured are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use soybean.
"The Bio qualifying for mattresses means that the heart is made on the basis of natural products," explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattresse coatings; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of ball plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for weak sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (with more pores with a disturbed cell structure, therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold mouses gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health tools.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for mattress and sommier is not easy.
From time to time, there can be two mattresses in special actions from manufacturers or producers for one price.
Like, for example, the Magniflex company that offers duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam coated for 11990 crowns.
Of course, the second can be taken free of charge.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic mosquitoes with an open cellular structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
This began as a material for NASA because astronauts were undergoing enormous loading factors.
The Tempur gets warm and hardens, on the contrary, the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against the bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
viscoelastic mouses are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve the legs and the vein system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Apparatus to follow people are increasingly requested by parents who want to watch their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think of monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, established at the beginning to search for cars can as well be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases as exemplary as that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of lights but will soon be of a watch size.
The case of little Anicka touched a large number of people and they started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin from MAcro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of tracing equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as put it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who really buy the product for safety reasons," Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know what the "box" is used for and how to use it in emergency situations.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear one of these things on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something intentionally when they don't want to be under control.'
"Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
In her view, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly controversial.
"If this is a prepared raft, the author will do everything he can to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"currently, it's the phone."
"When tracking devices are going to develop, they (the criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be in advance on the police," said the psychologist.
It admits that such devices can help in an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, which provides tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having such a device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an aggression.
"The device may be set in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and is in a position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special software.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to the device that is attached to the size of a lighting box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can still lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Well, he will realize that after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of systems for acquiring a position using the GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigating) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could turn the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km of it.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of the ropes is not more than two to four years.
The army bought ignition cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff has given the reason for a huge amount of detonating ropes to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating ropes.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that was true, the military's reserves could live there for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, more than 2 m of detonating ropes, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - has provided reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their guns and that shooting sessions are limited due to money needs.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't take my head if they buy at our house such a large amount of detonating ropes."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us, the army is a good client that we are trying to satisfy as traders," says STV Group's commercial director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, argues the hundreds of km of detonating ropes because the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky from STV Group reports that only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and army for only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in deposits, it can even go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in the light of the criticism of the army.
The past lifetime, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrity and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free of charge and still cost money.
The other department's argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 245 km," says spokesperson Pejsek who is an interpreter of the opinion of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the pyrotechnic pyrotechnics' detonating ropes that neutralize the second world war ammunition or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition required to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and more reliable detonating ropes.
The Ministry of Defence has today major problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Tschechos Republican army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, headed on to the Rhine.
What is waiting for this Czech army in a few years that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating ropes that it buys today "at a cheap price".
Until today, I take advantage of the contacts that I have gained through the competitions.
The sale under franchise of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best individual Entrepreneur last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards the successor is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 semi-demolized apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a brave action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me the desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building that he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four star Pytloun design hotel.
This year another one of the same quality happened to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of the Pytloun hotels," was the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the year's entrepreneur's competition served well," says Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge until now that he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain regular trade relations.
He said that the successor reputation also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I especially observe in their homes the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, and far from, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of the victory was severely replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind itself.
The one who came for the prize at Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of SEK 100 million.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my employees as well and has increased our confidence in ourselves to fight competition,' says today the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a company where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades around his father for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they started to specialize in the press for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years he became the largest manufacturer of automatic press in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the successes obtained in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers started to really know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they worked with a company that got the biggest successor in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year did not pass to Farmet only in the euphoria of the victory.
The company's assessment was based on economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which has not really affected the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their scarfs of new materials and technologies.
"We did not, of course, escape this situation."
"The business figures fell by 40 per cent, and we had to limit our production and even licencing," Karel Zdarsky explains.
A viable society must know that, from time to time, unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and kept profitable results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the staffings, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main rewards in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Everything lets us think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is rising and with them the number of employees is also rising.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes crazy regulations.
The survey on the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been deleted.
The less glorious winner of this year's Absurdity Survey was the obligation to provide documents that staff can obtain online in the offices.
More than one third of the 4000 votes voted in favour.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It's changing thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer apply for the extract from the Trade Register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this competition in the absurdity of the year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year, 3,000 voters showed up, it was at least 4,000 this year that gave their voice.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only stop the company, and, this, increasingly.
"We may be in the number of documents to fill in for tax returns at first place in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of the conditions for the company, which is 8 more than last year.
The year's Absurdity competition was launched for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year on administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to late September, the last time before the competition is closed.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the competition organizer selects seven candidates for the "antiprix" and let the public vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the greatest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until last year's last investigation, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decide that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees is the obligation that motorway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees repeal two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which is still beginning in early November at Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of an event in which political and public life personalities regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, attended at the peak of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts stabs in the legs of entrepreneurs, and for this purpose my goal is to eliminate, each year, at least three dozens of paragraphs which today only make the company more difficult,' said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to remove absurd cuts are not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what was unpleasant to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report to the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pelering with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the application of the Individual Business Act.
The second most plentiful obligation in 2007, which was to report a 30-day service trip to the Labour Office for a foreign employee, was deleted with the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the reason for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The newness of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Company responsible for 2010.
The opponent of this competition is the support for the reasonable and fair company.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone company, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the year's rebel competition.
For this first year of this subcategory of the company's 2010 competition organized by Vodaphone company, companies who have no successor with a single long-term goal for the company have registered themselves.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different, their support and forecasting activity can be considered the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the Pragian software company and Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the principal contributor to the staffing fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
With regard to employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 per cent of them, has obtained the title of the company responsible for the Central Bohemia region and has been third in the region in the competition of the Vodaphone Company of the year.
At Olomouc, it is Mi Ryz Soft, a financial company, who earned for having introduced flexible working hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, wage reduction.
The jury also sent the title to her because it predominates with Czech manufacturers, supports a so-called activity in the surroundings and carries on the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to ensure that our business and administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the responsible company IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their home work and uses catering services from a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow who helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At all last, there is, also for its activities, a Laundry and Cleaning Company in Karlovy Vary Region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, higher qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner of the Moravian-Silesian region.
They were automatically registered in the Corporate Responsable category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Company competition, who had answered the questionnaires attached to the document for registration and referred it to the organizer before August 15.
The unfulfilled or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the lice companies had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsable company but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition the Vodaphone Year's Firme."
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the year's main competition," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison&Rose organization.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition.
In the Plzen Land Fund building, anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and trader in real estate Lubos. G.
The Commission had strived to handle a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed field was obtained by a specific candidate.
This one was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police prosecute a person for an insider's offence in the context of an invitation to tender and a public competition," said Pravo newspaper head of Plzen's Attorney General Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the investigation is underway.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, it is only possible to speculate in view of the so little official information.
On a question about Pravo, the spokesperson of the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
"He has acted with a client and in no case with an employee," she explained.
The public competition under Cerna has the real name "Application to propose rights for land transfer under the Land Act" and is put in place when a number of law-benefit candidates appear.
"These persons offer, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to repay which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the proposed rights a ranking of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the field to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information about the persons who had registered in the appeal and as he himself was also a beneficial person because he had purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he probably was incubating by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpellation.
Lubos G. had contacts far above standards at FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
It was part of the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing lands for which the decision to establish a building had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor was forced to accept because otherwise it would put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a surcharge of a hundred kronor monthly for housing.
Households will be required to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and rents in some places will also increase.
As of January, families will have to draw up up to a hundred crowns a month more from their wallet.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas is almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity for apartment households is expected to be approximately 100 kronor per year more than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices in view of the sensitive development of encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need the most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
One hundred more crowns can therefore also be counted.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 kronor more per month for central heating as of January, and Liberec families will pay more than 1000 kronor per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent is being made for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If rents do not change the Praguens will pay a supplement of 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already one of the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 per cent.
For example, rental prices will rise significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Bouty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be translated to the courts by the company.
The regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10 per cent next year.
The Czech children drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and, in exceptional ways, the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who drown, who are not yet 15 years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recurrence do not make the exception.
This is due to the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from the child departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of the Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they succeed in chipping a bottle to Dad in the closet, it's sometimes wisky but it's the fernet and the vodka that prevails."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman of the Motol Hospital, is also right to her.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"This is fashionable alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, he did slivovice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Chief of the Department of Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working at Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced just ten years in paediatric care where ambulances brought schoolmen from the broad, completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times so
"She started her 12-year-old career when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol into the blood with an additional mixture with extasy," the doctor wrote this particularly important case.
She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party.
"What is interesting is that it did not seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the disinterest of parents or their tolerance out of common with the fact that their rejections give themselves to the drink that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
However, according to specialists, there is no mention of dependence, in the strict sense, on children.
"As an alcoholic vocabulary, there is a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena resulting from it but not found in children."
"Check those who use rehearsal acool, rather is a significantly unfavourable socio-family background," explained the Chief of the Department of Pelikan.
According to spokesperson Jurinova, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the paediatric clinic in Motol.
They are integrated into the statistics only in cases with a gruesome intoxication requiring hospitalization.
Children who are drunk after emergency care brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exhibits three seasonal waves: the day of the witch, the Holy Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Even after bad results they drink, or rather they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I lived on the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children of one blow," said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in disintoxication under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the child who returned to his home and suffers the following day of the "wood owl".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose lack are eliminated by infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised about where they are," says Pelikan, knowing that sometimes it wastes the good mood of patients with at least the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"At times, I used this as a means of education by counting for these children how much their ivory has cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay for one night," Pelikan added.
However, he said that health insurance companies in their regressive management, which should recover care-related charges from parents, did not deal with drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, started on Tuesday to Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is located.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad during exercises or demonstrations.
These are the two-place versions of the L-159T1 that were in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationing at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek from the Press Department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-place planes for the exchange have been taken on aircraft stored for a long time without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 biplaces were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He enjoyed that the army will not remain without a double place as the department signed an agreement in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody of a value of 200 million kronor for the transformation of four L-159 unused single places in two double places.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract, it is clearly stated that the person who takes L-159 into account is EADS and will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the person who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence did not launch a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
Defense management argued that the exchange ensures future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 appliances at Aero Vodochody and only uses 24 appliances, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has brought a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice as the aircraft should have been selected in the framework of a European invitation to tender and in no case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
Longer than yearly index is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the longer index than the year are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men before 60 years of age," announced the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, Professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be subjected to prostate cancer testing, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Great Britain followed over 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the year.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
However, in the case of those who had the longer index than the year, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years of age, the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Prof. Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech genetician and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he was aware of this study, but that he did not seem, he did not think, that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer was "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech Republic as most of Europe is covered by snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and trottoirs, there is most of the time of compact snow, the deblazers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 subway to Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The sender of the Automobile Central Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st kilometer a truck was crashed, at the 93rd two heavy cars crashed, the accident wounded.
Several cars also found themselves in the gap.
The problems are also on highway D1 to 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should get out right after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter the 182 km to Kyvalka.
A number of kilometers of cars formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car files are created in Prosek, and Sterboholska Street is also stuck.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways are delayed, for example, on the line between the Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and the Peace Place (Namesti Miru).
At 8 p.m. in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff must still meet.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 fast connections.
Lines such as Prague in Kralupy or Prague in Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed from Wednesday at 11:00 in the night until 5:00 in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable, but recurring vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are unpracticable, on the road of Brno it begins to have there by places of snow rafts and on the road of Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain channels of communication in the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snowberries and snowberries.
We can't estimate at the moment when they're rollable.
On the Hodonin road is caution in the White Carpathes region.
On roads that, in view of the protection of nature, are only maintained by the sprinkling of inert products, there is nevertheless a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The rainfall disappeared gradually in Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic gun will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise canon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this gun and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works as small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explode at the target contact but also at any point of their ballistic pathway.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, wall or gap.
He is also not protected from the top and when he falls on a deadly rain of steel splashes, it can also put him out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends a laser radius that determines the distance, thus obtains a specific target point, according to which he corrects its target site and pushes on the relaxation.
"Let's say you've reached 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters or less, 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 delocalised jobs
The Fujitsu group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their place of work to Astro Park, currently located at the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday, the giant specializing in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex of offices located on Lyoner Straße of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should include 100 other jobs that have yet to be split up in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Furthermore, the open space offices at Astro Park are better suited to the working methods of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us an important location with remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that connection to the airport is just of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region led yesterday to the joy of the winners and led to the disappointment of the losers.
Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), responsible for economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its settlement is an important momentum for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality very early of this intention.
"It is of course going to say that we have proposed our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in front of the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by the company Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical" as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance of the city was created between the station and the City Hotel, which caused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and counselling company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, then still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the Deutsche Gruppe Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group with its headquarters in Tokyo is considered to be the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to companies and also provides essential service.
His branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters took for rent in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-shaped plan, has, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks are experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled from its servers the website specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, appears to be in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever more force.
The group of cyberactivists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its hosted server in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the leading American senator, Joe Lieberman, called on the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is probably staying in Great Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", indicated Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists who originated the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyberactivists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon had banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's employees.
The President of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks act illegally, monstrously and without scrupulous acts, thereby putting our national security at risk and endangering life all over the world," says an independent senator's communiqué.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independant", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyberactivist has consistently referred to as an intrigue orchestrated by his distractors of the prosecutions against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were posed against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange fears especially for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's why Wikileaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Mr. stephen Harper's adviser said on television, ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "deathed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a polemic emerged between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman of the American President, Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange had called for the resignation of the State Secretary Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to take care of the opinion of an individual owned by a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a communication from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorist Combat Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers was responsible for implementing "the necessary structural reforms" that were necessary after Wikileaks had disclosed diplomatic cables.
The White House is also willing to check the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in contact with them," said the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if this is necessary."
The University of the Glace
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confiscations are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does the whole ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the slightly demoded ice container, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatule, disposes of it in the waffle and then begins to sell it.
To know this, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cannot avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbiters founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered for several days. Practical sessions are also held in private ice cream.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others risk simply to realize their fierce desire for smooth ice.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is a feather of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the future to the country of Industrial Glace.
Anke de Berlin is a business management adviser and after a few years she wants to pull a few things out of this nervary profession.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian householder came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master of the glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal features of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not only the good taste, but also the soyous flexibility and the good consistency.
However, during the training, Luciano does not forget the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a lot of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano throws basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that warms up to 85 degrees through an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a rod installed on the machine: it comes out of a pasteurized white base cream, based on all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately attacked by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
The person who only speaks of "manufactured from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to manufacture ice without using a stabilizer, only you have to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client will not crack anything other than ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano determines the difference between the ingredients obtained in the fruit or confiserie radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to reverse you dozens of aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should simply try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when added cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must go to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hatch with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The various kinds of fruit ice is also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi ice, which is very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture properly suits the taste of ice," says Luciano.
The production of ice is a calculation exercise: if fishing purée is used with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the various types of fruit (the vines are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as before, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is used simultaneously to make it unclean and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, small failures are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo spoils himself with purée of fruits from the head to the feet and, thus, sparks his fellow studies when the control of the colossal blender bol escapes from it.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that such an incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time.
Controllers in a ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has coreled the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent Institute for Biotechnology Impact Assessment.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we learned well," said Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information indicates what the Chairman of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa Experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively with the development of EFSA test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to the criticisms of Mr. Then.
The requirements developed correspond, by paragraph, to the positioning of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry, which would be, in essence, controlled by the authorities established in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech declares a conflict of interest.
An Efsa senior manager recently joined the Swiss Syngenta agri-food group without condition or transitional period. In this way, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and the industrial lobby, which raised the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
It is not prohibited for experts working on behalf of EFSA to establish contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi, based in the United States.
This organization is considered to be a neutral forum that brings together experts belonging, among other things, to the field of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disappear that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding test and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what are the impacts of genetically modified corn on the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Mr. Then asks about a tone of the accused.
This is also the point of view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls safety research".
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell got it, totalling about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart station with her back tube.
There was maniculous.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September the excavators had come and had begun to demolish a large part of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, transforming Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that will cost several billions.
A large part of the wing was ruined when the demonstration resulted in the cessation of construction.
Brished in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim's Muschelkalk (the coquillary limestone), a soft and rough, badly built pavement between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They don't have to disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap, simple and earthly rock."
He asserted that by cutting it to the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know yet what he's gonna do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former deposit of French army ammunition in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built its empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken or if they disappeared in the discharge," he says in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard.
He reports that he was subject to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything at all to resist the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the parallelepiped stones weighing an average of 80 kilos, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a remembrance while also hoping to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still immersed in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, peasant gardeners, Private.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could enter the safe and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass bands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"no need for this political component."
He enters his car all terrain, turns his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did legal studies that he abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before he later became interested in computer science and eventually became a carrier.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He accumulates treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the largest merchant of ancient stones.
He's reversing.
Sand stones sculpted with art are placed on the snow.
"Once, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
He shows a bunch of fingers: Red stone of sand, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelepiped was once part of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion tribune.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Saint Blasian cathedral, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were used to be hand sculpted and displaced by simple palms and chariots drawn by beefs, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put into play."
He has not become rich, even less rich.
But this carrier today employs 14 people. In addition, stone tellers, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's congratifying," says the waste recycling machine.
Next, he must go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Fighting talents to conquer the high potential
The counter has a strong flow.
16 students can buy small salmon breads, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The Braunschweig Technical University and Volkswagen Automobile Manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of contest of ideas, they need to talk about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, know Volkswagen company.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to deny better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multi-form cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most skilled graduates in the amphitheaters as much as possible before the latter arrive in the labour market and they are brokered by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, it is attempted to identify and trust exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig, the car group amados the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards with Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and young talent students' jobs; she shows them how to access the group's site.
Nico Selle from the Braunschweig Technical University is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students enter into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"Where the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's happening again is the offensive we're trying to attract the students with.
"In some cases, the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much more bitter.
In the goods of the sectors, companies are no longer able to recruit their employees by making a tri on a cryrian of candidates.
However, they must inspire their reliability and, above all, shorten the highly skilled labour force.
Especially graduates from engineering industries are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 posts of engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the vacuum for engineer positions will expand further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expertise and consultancy.
It organizes expensive events for talent recruitment, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a type of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students next year so that they travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can access the KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who must participate in it decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high-potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Just today, we stayed in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct imdouement of the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing quite classically by participating in the professional fairs where they conduct brain hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in the professional fairs."
"For example, at the Solar Technology Exhibition," says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem of relay.
Currently, 35 positions are being competed on the company's site.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"This is expensive and takes a lot of time," he assures?
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to carry out professional internships or write his final study project at our home."
expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by highlighting other qualities: personalized ambience, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"In many cases, a large group cannot do this," says Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotional opportunities are the other key factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual chart of honour for German employers.
To this end, he questioned employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the employee's framework conditions.
The head of staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will increase the image of the company among job seekers.
"I think that candidates are mainly involved in external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Arbeitgeber Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to pass through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfactory employees form the best messengers."
When employees are well treated and identified with the company, they are making the advertisement of their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama brakes new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the Southeast State of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has banned an equivalent ban and thus definitively canceled its initial plans.
Even next to the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains forbidden.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform which is the source of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, subject to opposition pressure and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution thus want to reduce the US's dependence on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in the golf is not, until now, definitively resolved.
The UK oil group, which is faced with several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of charges.
An investigation committee established by Obama should present its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the gel of the drilling determined after the platform's explosion.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more stringent security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing deep reform.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would eliminate the profitable tax niches from gas and petroleum groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than so far.
"The Government's objective is to block the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO Audit Office, before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "None knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it produces a smell similar to that found in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and refinement of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't be exhausted," sends the environmental activist to journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil sludge in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young person in the boiling water up to the chest, as well as the fat tray surrounding him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water shine in the colour of the rainbow.
It can't be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil blankets.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells that she used to collect whole shrimps here.
But in the meantime the quiet waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil was exploded from a oil pipeline that exploded in the immense marble.
Fishermen living in the small neighbouring town of Bodo now have to drain for six hours to reach fishing waters: Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire range of sharks jumps to the eyes when the mangrove marshes crossed through watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the engine boat sweeps a cratch brown water. Anyone who drops his hand in it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of the small mangrove emerge from the ground as slate sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang.
We are looking for vain bird clouds, as we usually encounter in wet areas: As the outboard engine stops, a fantomatic silence is coming down on this former paradise that looks like a service station by the smell it leaves.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," said Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard."
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region is a battlefield for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was executed later. In 1993, Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous to his employees.
Again today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million black gold barrels are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields in the Ogoni country are unexploited because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters stand in the water of steel racks as strange sculptures: Very affectionately, " Christmas trees" are called hole heads of drilling.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are crushed by corrosion up to the benchmark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time, because a constant flow of raw oil flows into water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres of oil flowed into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that of the sea during the "Exxon Valdez" super-petroleum accident 21 years ago next to Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner blamed the Shell Group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than in the rest of the world: Only the rate of conduction failure is "more much higher than the scale".
Some forms emerge from mangroves to a place that, seen far away, looks like a abandoned workshop, full of cobalts and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with cobalts up to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many tones that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a motif on the site must be repeated: a small illegal refinery.
We have to heat raw oil in the tonne for several hours," explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then drops at the end of the fertilization of the kerosene drops and eventually gets diesel.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producer country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they purchase their raw material for free.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the oil pipelines network across the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: The networks of organized crime, which are also among its members of high-level politicians and soldiers, charge the lion's share in tankers and braden on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considered that the debate on whether to assign environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the laxist mode of production was purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, or illegal robbery and refineries."
But, In the meantime, Ogoni's relations, especially with Shell, have worsened so much that it was no more than the withdrawal of the group. "Maybe that operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to get rid of it," announces the robust oilworker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at the very least they will offer them profits.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, intend to enjoy the raw material, like all Nigerians.
"At any point of view, this damn thing has dropped our country well low," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "a catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had apparently had a greater chance so far: During its investigation, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warned against possible defects of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it may cause tiredness and leakage in connection with oil conducting, as indicated in a position taken on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a catastrophic failure of the reactors.
They are concerned with the Rolls-Royce reactors and are equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to land urgently in Singapore on November 4, is among those.
The Australian airline has now prosecuted the British reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court with its headquarters in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages to the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts separated and the carrying surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with relevant reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ADB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be important enough to inform all interested parties.
After the emergency landing of his plane, Quantas airline had stopped the entire A380 fleet on the ground for one week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced the A380 reactor by a precautionary measure.
The two-storey plane is the largest line plane in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany covered with white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos prevails on all roads, trains and aircraft are immobilised.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany shrink: By ice temperatures, almost the whole Republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On national A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked permanently, but they couldn't end the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent ravals have swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above the normal.
Snowmass on highways and federal roads caused serious problems in Sachsen.
That's why the bad weather warning station Meteomedia announced the level of violet warning was announced in Saxony Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds have scattered.
Several trucks and cars were trapped there at night.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt country, police authorities have announced serious road disruptions.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a traffic interruption and caused locks.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, serious disturbances in rail traffic occurred in Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Sachsen, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, in Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich must have interrupted its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers from the train to cover, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snow Chutes led to numerous cancellations of flights in the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard speaker and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson from Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Hand.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the number of passengers trapped at the airport is no longer, despite this, only 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nürnberg: even here, a truck was picked up at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a tonne on a gliding ground in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will spoil in case of light rage.
But the wind will be weakening.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
The Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The German Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could amount to up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's seat: The twin towers in the Business Quarter have been modernized, while the bankers have had to return to their former service place.
From now on, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovation and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as reported in the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we're checking if it's more interesting for us to own the buildings or sell them, and to make them rent again later."
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already abandoned its headquarters, shortly after.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for a sum of 272 million euros from the own funds holders.
Transformations aimed at energy optimisation have, according to some indications, absorbed approximately €200 million.
Of course, a sale would return a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, renamed "Green Tours", to approximately 500 million euros.
According to the speaker, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying for the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the enveloped minors who were declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
The body has not yet been lifted up because the safe situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 had been seized underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue team could descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors had no chance to survive.
So far, the bodies could not be lifted up.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party in the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a shining sun in Greymouth, south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 enveloped minors, there were 29 tables on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Personal photos and effects, including clothing and surf boards, also had their place.
Flags were placed in berne in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants on the commemorative party that New Zealand had given the hope that minors would return to the surface.
"But they never returned home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was seized into the pits, said that he cannot rebel to accept the death of his son until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative party.
Minors of South African and British origin also landed during the first explosion of 19 November.
The helpers started extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine of the southern island of New Zealand.
The police prefect Gary Knowles explained to the journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to decrease.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial movie?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limitations of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", the fighter's head.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is made prisoner; he releases himself from his drunk and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents each other. It seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is in bad mood, he discards the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borgne does not say any words about its true name. Even the other characters, at the most, let escape a few scary agonism screams at the end of one or two sentences.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the amazingly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland, which constitutes the decor of the Vikings universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film is aimed at several target groups, it is a pity that those films exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy concerning the drug trafficker, a type of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more dominant mood or introduce a little less brutality to the art and trial cinema.
Most of the supporters of the art cinema must experience horror in front of the brain that spreads around and to the intestines.
The amateurs of action films die of boredom when the bornge boards, for reasons that can be interpreted freely, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned forever by calm and rudeness before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it only exists in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of poverty that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It's not a dialogue in this film, it's not a coherent action, it's all ambience, a fevery dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lubulous sound band, but above all with an insatiable hatred that blew out of the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully next to the borgne, preserves some innocence, all others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the bornish hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by transforming into warriors, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents the trash, but perhaps it is also, nothing but for those who are, anyway, trash.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which has the purpose of aggression, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terraced work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
In the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I huntplanes attacked a mysterious cubic building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrate; the largest city located near it is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in IAEA documents, as it is the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a briefing from the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby community, el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with cloudy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the power plant which represents a miniature copy of the North-Corean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be deployed, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information than at the time, and even with the time the mystery is becoming more and more thick.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built an el-Kibar reactor, but had little evidence that this country was developing "an active nuclear weapon program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor", even if they consider the presentation of the CIA to be "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about how he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat only gave a laconic response in the summer, stating that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly took down with precipitation the decay of the "unused military building" and proceeded with a methodic landing.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team of experts led by the former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers through a Member State showing the time that followed the attack directly, which seems to be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it had never implemented a secret nuclear programme and that it had not built a reactor.
Damascus argues that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particulate matter by qualifiing it as invariable.
Since then, ladies refuse any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuse access to the demolitions of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation on this matter has been lengthy since June 2008 without achieving a result and that it "is increasingly transforming itself into a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-level Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, finally it is a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty.
The IAEA considers that progress must be made to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have neither indicated what facilities are involved here, nor what their function is or what they are suspected of being retained.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA, respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also under the name of neighbouring cities.
The Washington Independent Institute for Science and International Security identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would probably be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in a military base or directly next to it; that is precisely why Syria refuses to access the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians feared that the inspection group was actually the spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, this is an information provided by American secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallèlepipeed to transport substances.
A high-ranked Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "serve to fuel production".
It would not have "no indication of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are credible assumptions about the following basic issues: from where uranium should have come and where the plutonium required for the manufacture of the bomb would have been later separated.
It is not known whether the grafts, which could hide traces of great value, have been stored in all three sites.
When hundreds of land-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on the site of storage of the gravel.
For IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria would have examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it is suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analysing satellite photos on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, IAEA's former inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, satellite photographs show that Syria has undergone terrace work in the three suspected and displaced sites of huge containers when IAEA began to require access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not contributed to avoiding suspicions.
He said in the diplomatic media that IAEA has spent several months preparing a plan for inspections to be carried out, which was intended to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time spent shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States, who, for a few months, has mentioned what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already referred to "a option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council and, on the other hand, many of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation escalation.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives a reflection: "Is it useful for it, if at the end they find nothing?"
Love in Time of War
It's bad since Angelina Jolie started in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian bourreau during the war of Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the tour sequences planned in Sarajevo were displaced in last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is directed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic from the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and requested to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago she proposed to these women to meet in Hungary, but they rejected this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario tells about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reported that the Hasecic organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the status of ambassador of goodwill to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who received copies of its scenario, had given Sarajevo a touring permit after a few hesitations, but we don't know why then did not come in spite of that permission.
The young author himself assures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it has made a lot of effort to raise awareness of the Yugoslavian conflict and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express itself.
However, it remains vague about content.
Thus, a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. He meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported into the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is nevertheless a big difference with the version "a victim of rape loves his bourreau".
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure that is exercising on it, so it is Jolie, is "injustice and based on misinformation".
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring peace to him: Putting this scenario illegally in the Net, as many others have done before.
Let's go!
This evening, everything's fine with the Irish again.
No trace of anxiety.
That's why the local team overwhelms visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy on the bottom of a strong music, they scream with feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in the south of Ireland vibrates because the players are launching and succeeding in dropping table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups from the opposing team.
This strange show is called "Bier-pong". The winner takes 500 Euros plus an air ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January at the world of beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle game to drink and the reserved computerist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrific question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not part of his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange feeling, however," he says.
"The native country is so far away and I don't have a job there."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she took up her job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiled.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social assistant, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people go away: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of the tanner.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even provide for a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are achieved, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom, during which the Irish enjoyed a great momentum, the sadness now takes the full place.
However, the economic crisis affects especially the young Irish, well-trained, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social declining seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes abundantly the letters of readers written by young emigrants who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes off."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity, goes away and our country thus a generation."
"The last one to leave turns out the light."
The student in law, Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing powder in the eye and offers no prospects for the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old young student.
She sees how her comrades crawl from a practical internship that is not paid to another.
She states that her greatest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressed thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to address this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition, which provides full support on the theme "working abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps at the levels of professional hierarchy," says the manager.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallerie, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house just comes from land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete the credit contracted to build his home in the native country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I almost don't live anymore."
He shines with a embarrassed laughter passing through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-heated front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are stationed on the access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of EUR 380,000, which was financed 100 percent by the credit.
"These were moments of madness, undoubtedly, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse due to credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, rehearses hot tea and says, "I don't have children to maintain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"The people must not suffer hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what has been experienced here in the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not what can happen worse, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years ago and, in Ireland, life simply continued."
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his palmares, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life in New Zealand must not be as easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there's still one thing that worries her very much over the last few days: the party to be held on the occasion of her 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a goodbye evening.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said by drinking a long cup of beer.
"A goodbye, it still sounds worrying."
"Let's call it a goodbye evening, relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private business.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it follows changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerged from this year's survey results in September and early October.
The first is the pretty sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convincing democrats, thereby reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy functioned in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (graph 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in the parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in a strong rise compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shattered support for democracy.
While this has lasted well during the global financial crisis, it is certainly because many countries in America have only suffered a short recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to protecting the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see graph 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a broadly shared feeling of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
Only for the second time since the survey began, more respondents across Latin America as a whole have quoted crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been victims of a criminal act over the past year; however, this figure is falling from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private and market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriated by many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A drained vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the damaged and drowned country in fear.
Election boxes and a new ballot, ballot bulletins scattered in the gardens, successful polling stations and intimidations have been presented.
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who have been displaced as a result of the January earthquake, would go in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them finally abandoned.
A dozen presidential candidates, several of whom were suspected to be favored, declared fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event to be "a rather good election in many respects".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have carefully stated that they "do not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they may be, have necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents owe René Préval, the outgoing president, and her candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no visible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic that is raging, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, we feared that participation would be.
In the meantime, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganisation.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet to the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, had a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, apparently in mourning, that she would abandon or not the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded as president, used to develop budgets that underestimate tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This made it possible for the first couple to spend the additional income on a willing basis.
Mrs Fernández's government lost her majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation fell into disruption following Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which a parliamentarian hit one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), the Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President with even greater flexibility to spend on purpose.
The economy is overheated: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions' wage claims are almost 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleared the INDEC, the statistical office, which did fake official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit wage increases to 18% next year.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eradicated growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Ms Fernández showed signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the bonders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its maturity in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be moving towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always stressed that this could not involve IMF monitoring, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which is similar to a prelude to INDEC's consolidation.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentinans will return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have rebounded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not, without noise, to reject many policies of her husband.
Half an hour for China
The Taiwanese voters have been moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother located on the other side of the narrow?
More than 7.5 million electors appeared on November 27, which is 70% of eligible persons, to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered as a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings in relation to the continent, having established innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganisation of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My did the test, but it was just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which went towards Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of Taiwan's elections, including tapageous campaign trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimal wear.
A tentative of mandatory mysterious murder was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot at the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, hurting him and killing a pass.
Wonderfully, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway,” said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, murder had consequences on the election by directing the suspicion of the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how the issue of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with public housing plans and job creation plans.
Taiwan usually enjoys its actual independence and hates the military threat of China.
For example, KMT tends to avoid paralyzing its links with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from touching the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed a confirmation to know whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide trade facilitations, in accordance with its strategy to retrieve Taiwan.
China has not wasted time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
It's better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
Anyway, the DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to jail following accusations of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a candidate for the Chairship of the PPD, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the PPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hastened approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems overwhelmed by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted on Taiwan being a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to break the Presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be difficult to choose among its potential candidates.
The KMT must do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite dizzy economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman of the KMT says that its firm and local antennas will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for convergence is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editor, "the point of non-return has already passed."
Nominations for Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
To perform at the request of a president, and people are required to learn about it.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked up by President Obama to take place during his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a large appointment in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not produce more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
Its 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" certainly made a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, its skillful hand of pop and radio and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line in Spalding in relation to Norah Jones' fulguring success in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of the Grammy Awards, taking into account the jazz productions in this category in recent years.
On the other hand, the voters of the Grammy Awards rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the "instrumental album" category, a shift on a revigorating sound of a record that was one of the prime favourites of last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of Veteran James Moody and "Positootly" of John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favorite to the raven voice of New Orleans and frequently invited to "Treme" of HBO, has been honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also strongly inclined to a certain merger with Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber albums.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well deserved recognitions in the large category; in competition with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and the everlasting adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a beautiful example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Nomination of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers around the world.
In the head of the nominations, we quote "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to South California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also on the lice for a reward.
The classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering recordings of orchestra, opera, choir and solo.
One category for the classic producer of the year has five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" which brings together various artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominates are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the German Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchester and the Choir of the Theatre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's 4 Symphony was first in Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former Mikhail Khodorkovski oil magnet, inmate in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was appointed for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he had written the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concerto with Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a large number of ranges and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old orchestral leader Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the band's performance category, leading the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment, are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harp Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only vocalist-soleists nominated: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of the Temecula mosque wins the approval of the Planning Committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
The criticisms took place in the project, claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic barriers.
But the Commissioners decided on Wednesday evening that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahas, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice wins."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronounced themselves for or against the centre, at the time of speech, approximately also distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There's no more America," wrote one speaker.
"This is another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"The America fell."
The planned Islamic centres also raised protests in other parts of the country, including at the Ground Zero, site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush declared violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of 135 co-existing families without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque to the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral School.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a truly "extraordinary form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report contained in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
Six major elements were long considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after having replaced phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. from the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in life research beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of alien life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "hows that, in other global environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be established," commented Charles Cockell, Professor at the Institute of Global and Spacial Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and the biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a stubborn discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, the organizations have difficulty separating these elements."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different so that it does not work exactly like phosphorus; it enters inside and, in some way, gums the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Deputy Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she said; so the researchers made the assumption that the first forms of life could have been used.
This suggests that there might be other ways of forming life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibiting dogs on four stolen outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, and the Sheriffs of Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two gallic pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside of a Bellflower 6 motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the department of the Sheriff of the County of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to tell exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say that," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a County animal shelter located in Downey.
Sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3 - year - old male, and Didi, a 10 - month - female - were healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgs that Rickard and Peek had planned to show to regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were worn away until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" at Long Beach, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests planned in the days preceding the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition," Peek said in the Times Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the Canine Exhibition Tour of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppet, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton sword - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgs, to the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be fresher.
They opened the windows a little bit so that dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to rotate again, the restructuring of MGM is only waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A New York federal bankruptcy judge officially rented the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be eliminated; opening the way to the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of movies and television broadcasts.
With the Thursday decision that the plan meets the requirements of the United States Bankruptcy Code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to resurrected under the supervision of the founders of Enterprise Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the directors-general of what will be an alleviated studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the beginning.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is hit by itself at $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances because it did not have the means to pay interest at $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in rehabilitation known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy more than 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to sell the company.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders, among whom none of them were ready to pay the additional 2 billion of which creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and discussions, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollars premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have collected $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success premium" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to revive the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the video game system of Microsoft, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a game Kinect costs the same price as 10 classic jumping ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ Wholesale Club - to see electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Moore Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price otherwise a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are toys of the size of a Indian pig who sing a note when pressing them on the stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspiring the Elmo Live technology of last year, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays roll-to-roll games like Simon Says and can do Moon dance thanks to its innovative joints with wheel blocking.
Children who wiped the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child from the 1980s, you will remember Alphia, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a walk into a car into a session with a self-correction and a valve classifier.
If you are distrustful when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo of VTech (60 $, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and most easy to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not work as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 $, for 3 to 12 years), this is the first major review of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 $, for 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes type system to offer electronic games and books and is equipped with a SD card entry that allows to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a lighter box, each having its own LED screen.
The aim is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling competition.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for the 6 to 12 years old) which includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit to the Club Penguin store for two items.
It may be a roller patins or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the last button-battery micro-robos.
The false bestiole moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a block labyrinth to see if it can find its way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentane passage into our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin took a place in the city as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous loads, by issuing low-speaking orders with a military authority.
He wanted women of chengguan - imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and looking for violence - to give some impression to a group of spectators.
"Let's go right!"
"Be persevering!"
Show them, he said, "What do the pretty girls look like?"
Four girls who barely passed the teenage in white gloves, dressed with identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, were stuck to your guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four treated hats perfectly perched at the top of hair tied by a blue and white rayed node.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, disgustingly.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of Chinese urban inspectors.
A city required all new recruits to have a degree in higher education.
The province of Guangdong exchanged gray-green uniforms against a so-called more committed blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack car by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporter repacks his business and leaves.
Xindu, a 680 000 city district in Chengdu, chose to conduct a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment with 13 women specially selected for their appearance, galb and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties attracting a look at this underground urban brigade in China
And for this reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them in the process of dispersing a protest against waste landfills.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without giving blood.
This year, in Shanghai, a pasteque colporter was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available by download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chhengguan marked the government," last year deplored China Daily, a national publication, after a first polemic on tactics.
The newspaper called for "complete cleansing."
The scepticists say that the approach is far away from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The announcement of the district required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five characteristics of the face in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officers said that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that is important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of candidates will determine if they are suitable; this is the size, weight, face characteristics, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "internal qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases," he said, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not accede to this description.
However, he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the face characteristics.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, persons with disabilities or defigured persons should not apply.
"We can't let a boxing person or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has the toys puffed with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the development of her appearance to be gender-based, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for an outdated air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague, said, "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to limiting their mandate, said they, because they feed more career ambitions than simply hunting sellers in the streets where they are supposed to restrict their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen ambulant merchants who move quickly on foot or on the bike, trying to sell as many small breads or tofu bowls as possible before taking the leak.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu, while a seller fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his nozzle bike.
Agents describe their functions rather as monotonous than hardy.
"It's about the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, who studied marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread of false rumors that the chengguan officers had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen policemen and officers of the chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles were shot or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two pastes of houses on the Placide Place Baoguang, where women's officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the trottoir rather than in a store, as prescribed by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the shameful face, broke off a path with a cubic clamp to their vehicle and went at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men at the age of 40 or older - have a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbalely."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li said of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case related to an assistant of an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying work for the wife's husband, on Wednesday the lawyers of the senator.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered as a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential office until the scandal around his case did not make the big national titles last year and harm his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to hold any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, that there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a profit-winning lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of policy donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to be contrary to the so-called ban on the turning door of lobbying.
According to the evidence made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantially violate the law of the turning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed to be distrusted by political prosecutions after a number of high-level reverses by its Public Integrity Section, including the decision taken last year to abandon the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens accused of guilty prosecution.
The federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking arms," said Melanie Sloan, Citizens' Director General for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and a follow-up on the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed it on Wednesday in a communiqué, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the Prosecutor's Office.
"I am not comfortable to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the Ethics Group, supporting that the $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The election committee stated that it had insufficient evidence to prove that the money was everything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, communicated to Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marteling" the Ministry of the Interior on a question in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Secretary to convene a meeting on behalf of the airline after having hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the case appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologised to his electorate and resigned from his post as leader in the fourth Republican position in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to give a third mandate to the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half a dozen of them were sniffing away in the rows of the hearing room.
They sent every minute terrible testimony reports via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape trial and children attached to their beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the extensive trial followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three Cheshire family members in Connecticut, should result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence to the court that sues appeals, which can be held in court for years.
What is provoking is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and extensive use of Twitter journalists - have created a "circus atmosphere", such a widespread and instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The application could encourage appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced it in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of State, rejected the claims in the last week's judgement, claiming that the media were "monitored carefully" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been driven by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
The appeal courses have recognized for decades that the media coverage of well-known cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgement of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the sentence of a Cleveland osteopate, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere" in the trial for the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television broadcast and film "The Fluchting".
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious in view of the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the large trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford School of Law who studied the death penalty at Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from the hearing rooms could allow more fair trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which may be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defense lawyers also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered damage when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defense lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will support that the judge has unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been criticized before the prosecutors, and that he abused the pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberations over a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestrated.
But their arguments on the impact of the intensive media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates in the Governor's position and in the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media was constantly putting the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily buzz of the tweets of the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen before in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the assertion that the new instantaneous was more inflammatory than the slower releases, was a luddy view that would undermine the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courses were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the Supreme Court's decision of 1966, which had reversed the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of the media coverage of the trial, and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represented Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civilization bring the gaps closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negative, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a sign of real bi-party cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the political struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not give rise to any breakthroughs on the major issues to be dealt with during the session of the "Black Candle".
But clearly, there was at least a polite discussion on the differences between the two sides and on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Wednesday public meeting of the Committee on the President's Deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap, but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual trial in order to achieve signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments from the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
Nevertheless, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"It is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration officer, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections raise partisan passions, and then they swell.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the session of the "lazy duck", the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment allowances, because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment allowances for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, more optimism is based on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session relating to the "lumpy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily mean a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely or even inevitable.
"When things that must be done will be done, in the short term psychology will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed its broadly shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or shadow-boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the electors present in the Tea that contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to meet their promises of reducing public spending and repealing the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first response to the Deficit Commission's recommendations that include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, deferring retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, imposed the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, consisting of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there are little motives or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston plans two phases in the battles between the White House and the Congress republikans.
The first will be in the form of partisan confrontations next year, since the Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the supportive spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged as losing will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are larger today than they were in the middle of the 1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological difference between Obama and the republicans of Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and the republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties saw 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civility presented this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort on both sides to find a ground of agreement on issues that still divide them.
Released American documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "Kleptocraty" and makes a portion of the money and the money for protection that it collects go to Kremlin, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rackets that contribute to explaining the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes his part while the money goes up to the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expended.
It was written when Iouri Loujkov was still Mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and her wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years, and he has won several trials in defamation on these charges.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel when he was interviewed about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's nonsense."
The Russians believe, in an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to surveys.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report from the Embassy; and it is unheard of thinking that it would be for foreign diplomats to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to appoint it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government functioned more as a cleptocraty than a government," according to the embassy note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a " krysha " (term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City Government.
"The analysts to identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militia are at the second level."
"In the end, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is spending the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from the MVD and the FSB (not only from organized crime groups) because not only they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be inequality; even those paying are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he has admitted little progress.
The embassy note transmits reports of men who bring bags, probably filled with money, to Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the Moscow "think tank Indem".
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of a political class because it doesn't exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption would be more than $300 billion a year on the whole of Russia.
The country was classified as 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (at least the most corrupt countries).
The disclosure of the note of the US Embassy, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly reverse the discontents within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be accused, to some extent, of the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing and responded with anger to the statements that US diplomats had disclosed by calling Batman and approaching Medvedev to Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, contrary to ethics."
Former fighters of the Red Khmers forced to confront the past
In a poorly illuminated classroom with decayed concrete walls of poor quality, the director of Anlong Veng secondary school mentioned the man who built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he was concerned about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was in the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former red Khmers in the northwest of Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers went to the government, long-standing loyalty was finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to respond publicly to people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, headed together with the United Nations, sentenced its first sentence to a former member of the Red Khmers, condemning at 35 years of prison the former head of the sadly famous torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this development of the situation, anxiety has increased among the former fighters of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is anger and fear among the old red Khmers, but they are impotent to do anything," said Chhang Youk, Director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization conducting research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the diet has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million persons were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the Government of Pol Pot United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of Red Khmers combatants began to defect the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 waiting for his trial.
Without their blessings, most of the old red Khmer fighters have fallen into black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some red Khmer elite officers have kept their positions as local leader in exchange for depositing the weapons, they are unskilled farmers in low grade and file.
"These people received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed of the agricultural utopic ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before moving into 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"The life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to live up to our own needs."
The current Red Khmers Court has also raised concerns here.
The court should begin the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister, at the beginning of next year.
The court's mandate is to judge senior leaders and senior criminals, but he did not say whether he would continue beyond these four cases.
More is needed to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations were directed to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have died.
Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the field located near his wooden house on pilots, on a land road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun threw long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Campagne is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there's no more prosecution, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Red Khmers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians challenge this.
" Cambodia must dig a hole and enter the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all that Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Red Khmers, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most Cambodians, the young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, student at Anlong Veng University, said that the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They don't trust because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers retain a powerful atrace here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by the weeds and puffed with plastic bags, leads to a black suction rectangle, covered with a roasted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a battery of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone vendor on the roadside, said that she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of mature bananas in the hope of bringing happiness.
Belarus accepts to renounce its military-quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué after the State Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, in the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to abandon highly enriched uranium and seemed to have released the horizon last spring.
But the American officials have reported to Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-quality uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who mentioned the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the 47-country nuclear security summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton described the "very significant, important step-by-step agreement" concluded by Belarus.
Obama committed itself in Prague in April 2009 to securing all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide within the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Summit on Nuclear Security, the Belarusian President, Alexandre Loukachenko, said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is mainly military-quality uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"This is our product ... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're gonna use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago; however, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate Belarus's uranium in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, said managers.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said managers.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to the managers.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been implemented to strengthen confidence" leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Director of the Department of Energy Specialized in the Reduction of the Global Threat.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the severe repression of human rights by Loukachenko.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"All in welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has no objections to CIA's flights
The Government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram by the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered (cable) documents by Wikileaks to the El País daily, which add that the first vice-chairman of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested the Spanish Executive to be informed of "power to demonstrate that they exercise adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe, which was responsible for complicity in human rights practices with a dozen countries, including Spain, took place a meeting between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the report of the Council "surprised the Government of Zapatero out of play" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to the flight of intelligence over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" in order to avoid "stop them off," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would give this case the lowest profile possible, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence capacity".
In turn, in January 2007, Procurator Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the Department of Defence on CIA Flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States has shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o from the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal discreetly with the case between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented to him that "although the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and do what they consider appropriate," he gave instructions to his employees "to avoid the comments of an inflammated rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide that went to confession complained in the network of the "inaccurate" being a mother
The young girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Fehler to the galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this surname she used as soon as she was small, she was communicating with a cousin and at least one friend; the two originated from Noia, the village of Coruña from which she originated.
Messages dated from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his emotional life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old galican girl had initiated a relationship with Iván TŚez, an industrial girl.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they split up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man of Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the young man stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, they hear their idyll has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque alone and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and miserable for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what means being with the child all day and not having the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message that she had just received, "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If she does not like it, let him leave the child with my mother, and I will take it when I come home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because the day I have to present myself to a job in order not to lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if he is not my mother," doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July there is another post.
When she hit him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had been allegedly murdered on the 10th, died.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but he is not on another."
"One side he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on another he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"He'll be there (the child) at a few hours of summer and so I'll save a little money from the babysitter."
17th of greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come."
"Alberto says he sent you, I don't know what videos he sent to email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On 30, another: "The child is good, el goes in summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me with money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the universe of MySpace, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Galician Error (epigraph)".
The last man who lived with her, watchful, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had passed so that she didn't notice that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial prison of Palma, from the Minorque court prison centre.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts went, "and she did not intend to hurt the minor."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and depositing her body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor applied for a psychiatric trial.
The members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already referred to the general because, even if progress is made or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training gets in these committees usually doubles the number of votes it receives in Catalan.
For example, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in 2008, while the autonomouss in 2006 received 316,22 votes.
On last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend was maintained, wishing to dismiss the vote of the PSC and the loyalization of the PP election, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MEPs in the Congress, while the CPU would also win four of them (he has now 10) and the PSC would not lose more or less than 9 MEPs (he has 25).
These calculations would determine that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, ERC would lose a member - he has three now - while ICV would keep a member or win one.
But if the election agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal comics, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relays at the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the governments that manipulate the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and people agree that the PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not also have the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debase, it would not be fantastic that this training would lose its representation in the Barcelona mayor - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, of which mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and seeks to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, in Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian held by officers of the General Police Information Police station in Barcelona were a jihadist cell, headed from Thailand, which facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Campai" the Al-Qaida counterfeiting device has been "debilitated" at the international level and, consequently, its operational capacity.
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that incorporated the Al-Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with complete impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only jihadist network that was operating in Europe, that is why in the investigations, apart from Thai services, other European police units were involved, and that is why the next few days in the territory of the European Union could be shots similar to those recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddis Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand, another was carried out, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who led the cell established in Spain and other European countries since Bangkok.
The Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the World Islamic Front.
In other words, the documents should be on behalf of young men aged 25 to 45, with several years of validity and without visas.
The investigators stress that until now there has been no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia to the bombay attack, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after that by the "command" integrators who killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas its conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those presented during the campaign and which were summarised in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-souverainist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address at half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples has arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he had 18 MEPs at the elections on last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the CiU candidate requires at least one of the trainings that the opposition will perform in the vote of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, in support of an investment "all sovereign and independent speeches should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
Both leaders have shared their bets to make the political device of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Detailed negotiations on Mas' investment will take care of the part of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to "deficiency of measures"
Olot's owners do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The leaders of the Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Generia) held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly persons who he was responsible for during his work.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the centre's lawyer Joan Cañada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to indict the responsible person" for the dead, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the processual situation of civilian officials".
Apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer from not detecting the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that since that day he continued to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old geriatric patients - care he suspected that in many cases no doctors were personally exploring the deceased, but given the age and the pathologies of patients, the formality was done by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures could not at any time have been the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only one index of imprudent from any other person except the accused".
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused him to die by injecting a sobre dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pastills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the Centre's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse used to relieve the suffering of internals to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he has sought less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, he burned them inside by giving them washing as he has already confessed that he has done with the three women he killed during the period 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the night nurse's statements, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions Vila gave in his visits to the Tribunal of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way to kill after having committed eight murders successfully.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors suddenly reacted yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday, which prevented "the markets must not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the peripherals have closed and the shares of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to be mistaken, and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will late lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB has quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw for the fourth time tomorrow in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding long-term liquidity measures, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the quarterly auction for unlimited access will continue at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal that it should be intensified.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw liquidity measures, whom God helps us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even planned to buy bonds and collapsed the markets, history could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought a lot, by causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 base points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a change in market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures from the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published.
Estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential, and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are presumable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain Parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment, like the four seasons of Vivaldi, look at investors' hearings.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered the 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will solve itself with a strong demand and help to dissolve doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request an Assistency Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types, and they cut access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be the strategy of Caesar's wife, "besides being it, it must appear".
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, because he considers him "none of law", the next 16 Judicial Council of El Enebro, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to raise their majority and take over the management bodies of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's own company.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control by the group.
The founder of the larger holding company business services does not seem to be willing to give up in its dispute to be present in El Enebro's management bodies.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves as administrators at the shareholders' meeting of January 18th of this year whose contestation is registered in the Trade and Society Registry.
The Judicial Council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Madrid Commercial Magistrat Number 2, opened again the box of toners within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the applicants to his five sons to try, through a processual arguation, by clearly defrauding the Law and by abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on 18 January", according to his official speakers.
This argument will be the basis for the contestation, once the assembly is held, in view of the fact that it is "of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain discreet silence, have already tried without success to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, including assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group seeks 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for appeal for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selected universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, no one took into account the options of a new bar that had just arrived, despite the ascending path of the last seasons, in the last stage of the championship, they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without decreasing the ability to pilot the champion, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1, we are talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
In fact, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly chains for all manufacturers of plants, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to create and execute "in short hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analysing and projecting all kinds of changes on bolides.
Siemens director explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's bolides except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamic and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser and high-tech autoclave production systems.
As the sole limitation of this insane technological development, there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bolides in a 50-km location from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two pilots, Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull, probably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the enormous technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has provided for its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is inestimable and nowhere known.
The factory technology director, Steve Nevey, said that five years ago it could be said that R+D progress in racing cars brought 50% of the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 clean stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational company plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will record this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-marking centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's Vice-President Helena Herrero gave an example of the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which she has been working with 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implant 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were Bucarest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third being Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even if she confessed that Madrid might be the next destination.
The Director of HM Personal Systems has assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that this is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of trade claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-wide pioneer pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP's guaranteed computer equipment.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes, we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flight' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's delegate administrator, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the Passive War.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted to partially offset with increments of commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million individual customers in three years, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to be exploited over the next three years and thus can survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011, which will be a three-year plan.
The objective, apart from survival without need to use FROB's public grants, is to win a market rating through the capture of a million new private customers - 700,000 if you deduct those who can get out of the bank - its great task to be done, because so far this bank had more damaged SMEs and companies than the particular client.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rate for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now hesitate to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Master Plan Optima, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for a further fiscal year.
Customers who leave savings funds escape will be their main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the bank case, he insisted.
And even though he thinks that the debt war - which penalises margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums paid by banks and banks for its emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't tightened the robinet, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend of the banking sector is now "increasing commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The Sabadell Steering Plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of undertaking operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "there will be applications of larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He argued that the capital needs "greatly increased" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
He also mentioned that FROB could replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell is able to survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but rather than what happened in June, we can obtain short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings funds and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector takes place.
When the Spanish savings funds merger proceedings began, there were several entities who assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has worked very much in this operation too," stressed the Director.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is "at the highest speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is achieved within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he stressed.
"The transition of 45 cash cards with an average of 28,500 million of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an equal trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of fairly unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of serenity and sense", because "the Bank of Spain does is to recall that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and he attributed to people who questioned him a "deficiencies in knowledge".
The director mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a "very important" and "will be at the greatest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well drawn from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a difficult government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new adjustment methods, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of 426 euros of aid to unemployed without a professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, united with the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel as regards her responsibility for dismantling the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction on the difficult process of re-definition of the euro.
And then Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with it to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, although now it seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable opinion flow, almost 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, fiscal rigidity, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extending to the private sector the cost of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long defined itself, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of disparity between what Germany thought to do (tax rigorous plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second strike of the central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, it has been subject to fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and public opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's Treaties to enable the rescuing of a country and, at the same time, to oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European position, as it has prompted the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little sweetened, has been approved and in the following months we should be involved in the reform process of the Union which will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has traced a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the creation of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be obliged to terminate payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a part of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The statement is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of reducing the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked for is much harder.
And what he must absolutely not do in these circumstances is betray ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will allow us to have greater tranquility.
And we know how to understand the opportunity that we were given until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard of this form and his dual statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggest that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the thesis that we need to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot exclude it from abandoning a monetary zone that is too full of countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Similar to Alonso and Ramos against Ajax, they show ingeniousness but not the willingness to escape a penalty.
The deportation by two real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the League of Champions made a lot of ink on the anti-sporty character of such behaviour and if both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (that their team already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will be able to carry out the regulatory penalty during the next match of the barrage game against Auxerre and to pass without cardboards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee has sanctioned with two matches the team coach José Mourinho and various economic amounts to the players involved.
Provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances like this or similar is not a new, otherwise rather common practice in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of ethos, non-written rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the relative case is due to the fact that this as a protagonist had a team of Real Madrid's entity (which in its hymn displays nobleness and honour and who in past occasions sentenced to a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, seems, by Mourinho, which adds more to its dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this kind of behaviour does not expressly be banned by the regulation against the principles of sport, i.e. if there is a legal fraud with these actions, because they are actions that are respectful of the rules of sport, but seem to disregard its sense.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting mind.
One of the property that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that has not been jeopardized with these actions, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of these property that is mentioned with the right game is to avoid that the infracter player team profits in an unfair way from the other team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxal fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not adapt to what is normally characterised as fraud o fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in a cache to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the judge's punishment.
They waited and they would gladly accept the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that infractors receive from the intentional errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and that one does not get an advantage in the same game either, because of course the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cardboards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action, players perform a sanction match and pass to the second cycle of boxes, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of boxes occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the levels, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of strategic decision-making that promotes the benefit as much as possible of what the rules allow.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of law fraud), or rather they chose the time they were subject to it.
They made a strategic decision without depriving or fleeing the penalty.
Even though the border between engineering and law fraud is scattered, I think there has been a clear case of engineering.
It seems to me that the polemic is due to two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way the director is forwarded to cause them.
The evil caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in the NCB
The calendar dictatorship concentrates this year on a avalanche of bookings for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations funded by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tower and the lottery, when December comes also the group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for the restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive you price adjusted to capture to the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or meals, coincide businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete the complicity of accounting, the calendar of this year (as the night of St. Sylvester falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of 13 December, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the source of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the circumstances are, they all demand battle prizes, confirms the President of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The patronal's representative now dares not to predict how the parties will be this month.
"The people think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out, but they pay much attention to the prices," he mentions.
The case will be "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers have the tendency to descend a level with the crisis, so the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various centres, applications collapsed for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group states that there is an authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, which they responded to by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulaes of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the specificity of the calendar assumed more early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18 will also be an hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the parties in advance.
To their six group menus, they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a precondition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made using the fieldenoise method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the part of the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, confides the opportunity to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animated", even if customers "negotiate as much as possible".
That is true, hope for festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country.
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the informative and tasty details on the content of the Nord American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, rather than increasing, "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are imprisoned by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Thus, the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under attack by the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials with short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason for maintaining security.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear programs or missiles," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with its US counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high degree of nuclear arms production.
A message from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", supports the following: "Transparency is often unexisting; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked in Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make the responsible "very clear" that "the Pakistan Army must end with the silent support of terrorist groups".
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count to a high responsibility for counter-terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol sends a red warning to track the movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million United States diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
The 20th international police force with its headquarters in Lyon, France, dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his temporary arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red warning, many of the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the call red notice a free way for arrest -- that the national police body must implement -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement indulged the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday published a letter stating that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer questions by video-conference to the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange has applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the Missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia, her mother defends the innocence of her son -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he doesn't shut up.
On Monday he granted an indefinite interview to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of the U.S. State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates who are in the United Nations by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior terrorist fighter, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views expressed by Conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the Congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to consider the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate and prosecute his funds to anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance."
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper adviser, who must have returned to his statements after saying that Assange will have to be "moorded".
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use a plane without crew or something similar."
One person who has not asked for apology was Mike Huckabee, baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"He who is in the Government that filtered the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be too kind punishment," he said to Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in ERC with eyebrows for Carod's supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the first internal revolt within ERC, without a north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the supporters of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches as he had with other extinct currents.
That's why Esquera's leader will try to win his new criticisms with eyebrows that allow him to blind himself up to municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its secrecy.
By ballots, not by lifting the hand.
If the carodists want to drive a certain sentence vote to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half more one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgaria" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand the President a little more than making his position available to the military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that will be submitted by the management to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to programme the Congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider as a safe fact.
The leader of ERC has acknowledged that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the idea of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange of various goals" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he highlights two.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures that come from the Carod adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as a operating mechanism.
For example, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the execution of congresses through elected delegates.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the Conclave Convulse of 2008 commissioned the management to revise the model of assembly in a specific congress for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains incomplete, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at the end, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders we mention these of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
In the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases is mentioned the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the head hit, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a luggage bag inside a vehicle abandoned on Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan Municipality.
Very early in the morning of Thursday, on the four, land owners exploited in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest, on the autopiste near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots when he came out of his house to initiate the waste collection work.
On 7 November, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a shot at each head in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the gunfire in the front, we found a man's body on a solitaire road of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet percuted with a 25-scale firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies have carried out a comprehensive search for the rest of the body's members, but they have not been found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán alerted to the discovery of a body in Peña Colorada, the hands attached behind and the eyes tied.
The man had a wound caused by a gun shot in his neck.
At half of the month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in a vehicle safe in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán municipality of Zaragoza was found at the same time with the victims two death warning messages.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony Valle de los Reyes, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a near colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in cover, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the Ixtapaluca municipality, and the following morning a man's body in Huixquilucan was found that had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in agreement with a message that his executors had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces were detected with her image.
Around the end of the month, a man's body was found on the edge of a car in the Zinacantepec municipality with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the two men's bodies with the overwhelmed head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, who said, "This is what happens with those who do not align themselves".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and attached hands and feet, two bodies were found inside a abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cannal tape and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country at the COP16 has assured that its country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and has detailedly maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020," said Su Wei, its representative at the COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to convert its industry.
Indeed, in the past four years, his country has inverted $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made clear that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets for reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various ongoing or completed multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also one provincial climate change project, another for the change of glowing lamps by economic lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater in its view.
For example, he explained, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and plans to make it another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: Caesar Nava
The National Director of NAP has detailed that the former Panist Director has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is lawful.
The National Director of NAP, Caesar Nava Vázquez, has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legal and that the former Panist Director has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as Governor of the State, he said that, in any case, the expulsion of Espino was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address himself, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the Order Committee of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidate.
Nava Vázquez expressed conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he mentioned.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would probably be able to elevate the best director Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the remark "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He anticipated that the party's resumed elections of 4 July would reflect on the next dispute, even if "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment, it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have been made "a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years of government, Caesar Nava asked the princes to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they are coming out of 'safe'," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive may make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audit, because there is no crap in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promotes the law in Twitter for non-paper students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twittered the American president in the social network.
President Barack Obama met today at national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitter Obama.
His short message maintains a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the tax reductions at Bush's time and government funding were continuing.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican Blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem is solved, an action could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved by the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at a given time in this direction and then we will be able to plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate majority majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to request a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Rêve Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 years, have remained in that country over the last five years and have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the participation of a large number of Republicans, at times when the supportive organizations of the protagonist project have intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
Democrats, the majority of whom is supported by the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courtesy Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the departing Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past were Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the greater obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put your finger on the wound
The second step of the Plaisirs of the language was a walk in which participants spread narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plague? what is hoped of me?", asked the author Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Plaisirs of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (pending another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language," she explained).
The finger on the wound"...we embarrassed," slowly launched the Argentine writer to the public, most young people, who met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterward as a great story, with Luisa first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "pest" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting a answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectionologist she comes out convinced: "Peace is not my strength, it may be my wound."
At the end, after a frustration approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar."
The sunny protagonist relieved and concluded: "on the wound I only knew that it is what is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very linked between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely narrative that he called Eloge to Invention, where the finger on the wound is not nominated but at a given time is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous snorkeling who touched clouds, made people return who had gone away or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that then fired to talk to America, the great news that had from the beginning had its own chronographs and cited in Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the exaggerations of the conquering capitans.
"Cervants who invented all of us (the writers) laughed at the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in any way one would never have contended the history of America with an imagination that even lacked the pudeur."
However, he stressed, "the crazy and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, one no longer knows which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his inheritance that we are what we tell."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with her round table.
The Portugese-Cuban has put itss on the great plague of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces trade disputes and drug sale.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs contain a silent commitment that is not of course premediated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the author.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must be on the wound of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the benefit of dogmatism, "behind each assertion there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable by thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance, and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting them to recover the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles that face each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano had three defeats in finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, although so far he has not put into the millennium and that is why this opportunity is very special to him.
The Argentin finally comforted himself with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The satist strategy arrived at its first final as a coach in the Tournoi d'Ouverture 2002, when he held the tricks of Morelia with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Final 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentenary Tournament 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a reverse again, because his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented Timonier when asked him what would be his weaknesses in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the arbitrator whispers the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think it is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which do not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have only to prepare for us, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it's the emotions or anxiety to hold the title in our hands, the hands he has escaped, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will no longer get into this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
Persons must go to Visa Applicants Service Centres before interviewing in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for the processing of visas at the Embassy and United States consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to present themselves at the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC, according to its seals in English) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will provide some benefits for the applicants, including the following:
The total cost to treat the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another to allow the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to present themselves in an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearer CSA where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The United States Space Agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living creatures in space.
The United States National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) will communicate an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for alien life," which gave rise to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile atmospheres that were thought inhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like human beings if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered in the bottom of Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an ambience that was thought to be too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another life form, a second life form, different from that we know".
The space agency will communicate the real scope of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will take part in geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), with the view that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, we can make the arrival of 'bipartism' possible, we denounce.
The 60th had just settled when a block of opposition appeared in the Congress led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before launching the 60th Legislation Assembly session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they have repeated, we are initiating 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MEPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of PRD, were the only to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme by taking a political will and if they did not, they would be again served by both parties and thus end the opponent coalition.
"When here has come (the opponent coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political defence to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that there are coincidences with PRD, PT and Patrón and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is everlasting bipartiteism in Congress."
First of all, this group begins with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more, the Convergent abundantly.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now turned into a 'butin' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the honourable Member's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave out by 5 cupular agreements, which will probably be 9 MEPs, now at five, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we are not in agreement with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles of pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mairie.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles of pesos.
According to the Transparency page of Municipe, this last cheque number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 million 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "supplier account liquidation".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay another amount to this supplier, which was observed by the Superintendent Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the Act's forecasts when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after July 25, Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques issued by the Mayor to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 to July 2010, in the triennat of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, passed 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada tour in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a cave of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be treated and new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and trottoirs has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid close shops.
"Politics know only means closing a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, otherwise they did not do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelkeeper José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist revealed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the City Hall.
"The municipality must assume its responsibility and avoid that this goes back, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not only do the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, we must maintain it, but as people who deserve a clean place to live there and the Mayor must change its strategy to well maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention we need and this kind of facts highlights something that is famous for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that recovery of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent because they are not properly used and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must be interconnected with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, ordered and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites that should be ordered first, cleaned and online to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility to be an example of a better Sinaloa due to the various provocations faced.
Mazatlán's business sector seeks a worthy and free working Legislation of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th parliamentary session was set up by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRDs, one of PTs, one of Convergencias and one of PVEMs, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same model of party spirit or paternalism does not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility to be an example of a better Sinaloa due to the various provocations faced.
"We hope that Members will exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into a carnival mascarade of governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a worthy and especially committed work with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the previous elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 people's representatives is to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism activities, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Governmental Tourism Secretariat.
"I have understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a lower budget and that it is incongruous as an important economic activity generating currency and investment and which competes directly with the agro-industrial industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified to detonating tourism projects that help to provide certainty to the state and update the Alcohol Act that the previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, including toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magic Kings will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, because their home is formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothing they want so much.
The family lives a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live in the day because their father has no stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I'm out with the 'plebs' for sale in the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the young people.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long been seeking to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I said to him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive," recalls sadly Cayetana.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, shoes size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, shoes size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estonia, Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hasch, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Québec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The persons arrested were to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession in order to traffic, conspiracy and service stealing, among other things.
These searches took place following a long breath investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sécurité du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Administration participated in this police operation.
Illicit migration can continue without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should resolve the problem of ships charged with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year to hold any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Chief of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected from the back of the hand the criticisms that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree that action should be taken against illegal traffickers, and that is what we are doing through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because it takes refugees and captures children for at least one year," said Ms. Chow.
Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
" Canadians massively say to parliamentarians that they are not tolerating such illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a squirrel."
"They expect Canada to take strong steps," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections that had been rejected.
However, one Conservative said to the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote that every member who would object might then explain himself to his electorate.
The new unit does not make unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and the coincidence of Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea did not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue from last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was not necessary that the peculiar criticism of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, described this ad as "a lapin out of a hat" and "a brittle solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's just saying."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the QSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charest does not want to create this investigation committee, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an investigation commission is Jean Charest's resignation," says Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests to Quebec to give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent escalation is not the only project in the Charest government boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be made by the Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague from Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this dossier.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit motorcycle groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa later adopted the gangsterism Act.
High-monitored rivers
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to the high precipitation that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A land slide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritania.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another glide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
There's a road down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall occurred in several regions, from 40 to 70 mm of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain was expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 mm of total rain.
As these precipitations need to be added to the forming of snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is a fear that several streams will be overflowed.
Warnings for flood warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the North, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentides, and in the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood guards and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the high precipitation caused some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of the heavy rain.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the flooding of some lakes led to the closure of several routes, including in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on a warning foot and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Quebec Crue Forecast Centre issued, on Wednesday, warnings of strong crue for several rivers, including Maskinonge, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
The Quebec radio promoter Stéphane Dupont has been partially reversed to the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial speeches on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its rough wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that are not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Quebec's Social Assistance Persons.
The group complained that the amounts listed in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators must present solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, the promoter Stéphane Dupont had thought suicide was a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes in question of "Dunnt the Midday" have dealt with a delicate subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame was held in his place.
The last dispute was on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then delivered themselves to a media face-to-face that had caused a lot of reactions.
The director of CHOI said that he had done no donation to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduely negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already cleared my three-day suspension on that."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of gross language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has worked "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of large listening within three days.
King of King Fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montrealian Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excells in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing climbs on the world's tats and rings to look for new challenges.
"I started exercising martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," Zemmal explained, "in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for a little fight everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security officer and commissioned for the UPS company has just given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the World Cup of San Shou."
"The fighters who finished among the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, I finished the fifth-class tournament in China, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"To this pace, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where pins and feet, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels occur originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist from this form of fight is the Vietnamese-original American Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the sympathic gaillard."
"This is a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stage in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the half-finals are in the finals of their category."
"Afterwards, the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of the kungfu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor companies that obtained the most important, that of the project's stewardship, for a total of $295 million without bidding.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in a simultaneous manner with Hydro Quebec's choice to confide its responsibility to the private sector in managing this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management consortium terminated the contract without public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that may eliminate competition and lead to price increases.
"This is the new way to make collusion and defeat competition."
"That is to say, people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now do it openly," said Peking Member Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public's interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replicated in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collusion for this contract.
"I'm beginning to have my trip," she plagued, supporting that the PQ had been "unhonest" and had "missed rigor."
She said "this would be the least of things" the PQ's apologize for.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a limited time alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The yard is in progress and is due to step up until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiations.
Therefore, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week in Le Devoir, the formula of consortiums in the advisory engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A rapid overflow of the Quebec Business Register can count more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and the same legal person, or Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay James responds to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The main leader of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Baie Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that pointed out that the project's management contract was granted freely.
"If you go to tenders and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in this market and you say, we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of over $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, The Devoir had 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin completed 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16 contracts, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of $295,11,564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four companies that compose the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known for the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has abandoned that the QP is also linked to those companies that "fund it", before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The green label does not inspire confidence
More green, but honestly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in stakeholders in sustainable development, but also in fair brands and ecological certifications to guide its choices.
Pis, even though he swims in a media universe where the messages for a more responsible consumption pullulent, he regrets a lack of credible information, because he even calls his commitment to brake, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecers seem to grant very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be environmentally responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumer information seems essential to stimulate this share of the current lively consumption by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and doubtful nature of information would calm down the hardships of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers is as distrustful about the alleged performance of green products or services that are being sought to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 changing their habits and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to respond to their convictions.
At 61%, they also favoured purchases from traders in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Quebec's Home Consumpted loves to be the King of Recycling who seeks to reduce his environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside of his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or recommended co-caring to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which just took its first cliché.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to whom a financial commitment has been requested to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Society Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallèle, who hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent boulevard by giving him his full cinema vocation, did not get what they called for.
The government agrees to be involved in the file, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the State's office.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been reviewed downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris file.
He sent him an ultimate report ten days ago.
But the firm's counterproposal came to the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the assumption of the State's donation really needs to be removed.
Remind me that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinémas du Québec opposed a direct investment from the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinema rooms.
However, several stakeholders in the environment called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the cean master, has been carrying the author's cinema in his premises for ten years after financing its construction itself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to trust his clients.
The Angus Society and the Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not reminded the Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think about downward proposals made to them.
The sailing lifted on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks raise the sail on what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but they also deceive the feeling of superiority to Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative Government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were broadcast on the public square yesterday, offer more crushing details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, or in a federal election campaign, relates to how far the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
At the great surprise of the American ambassador at the post in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gave some explanations to this situation.
"A almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about daily domestic issues rather than bring this election to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States therefore concludes that "the proverbal elephant of this election is omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The ambassador is less aware of the "shorring silence" as both countries have intense political and economic relations.
"The ability of a candidate, a party and more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should logically be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Business Officer in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the trust vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit over a decade due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," says Breese.
Nowhere was mentioned that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast to CBC return from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O programs, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the abductions for CIA muscle interrogations.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome certain prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the case by case.
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Let's finally note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the responsible for this massive leak should be "moorded".
He had Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A Global Plan for Renewing Lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction required to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is the result of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to compensate for the lack of binding commitments for reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the fluorescent lamps that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact lamps or, better, by electroluminescent diodes lamps (DEL or "LED" in English), the majority of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG released on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the global car park emissions.
Last year, in Copenhagen, large issuer countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, further 5 Gts will need to be removed from this balance sheet to stabilize the climate up to 2 centigrades by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy dissolves in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy spending is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by two times more.
The fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED lamps, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - this company has also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a glowing lamp, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to producing very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown reserves for fluocompact bulbs as they contain mercury and that they must be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal thermal plants, which emits a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants are producing 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits of each country through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars per year for electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits in nervousness the announcement of electoral results
The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire "without time" after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce provisional results without further delay," said a spokesperson from the Chief of the United Nations."
"It calls on all parties and institutions to take responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure of some foreign governments, the election committee passed the Wednesday target date at midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday election.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the CEI had said on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls were multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CEI finally proclaimed the name of the winner of the second tour between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudful" votes in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the New Forces (UN) since the missing coup d'État in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Campaign Director of Ivorian President, said that the intimidation manoeuvres of the UN's voters in the north of the country had discouraged the supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were accepted by the Constitutional Council.
However, the opponents of Gbagbo believe that the country's highest courtyard is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political allier of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any link with the ex-rebels, considered the delay in the announcement of the results "inadmissible" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until claiming the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he lost and filed a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after he had prevented the election committee from spreading the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential tour, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country remained divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Iranian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the lead of the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France, within the meaning of the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area (9.7% in the overseas departments), showing the seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolitan areas.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the metropolitan active population and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, unemployment has risen by 0.1 points.
More generally, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether they were available or not within two weeks for work and whether they were looking for employment.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a further rise in unemployment, rising to 24.2% in metropolitan areas (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the meaning of ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolitan areas (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), or 482,000 people over the age of 50, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan areas (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published any monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polemic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the President PS of the Board of the Bouches-du-Rhône General, was examined and infiltrated at Luynes' arrest house, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been investigated for abuse of social property, misuse of funds and public property, recel, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and wants to explain all the questions that the judge will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reproachable leaders, it's something else to prove them," said the AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, the brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noel Guérini, has been required, through his lawyers, to make a memo to the judge before his hearing to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday evening and broken.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to make the discharges he had to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he has never known them," said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Agglomeration of Aubagna, was examined on Wednesday for misuse of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are charged to him."
"The instructor's judge has taken this into account by not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Ms. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with judicial supervision for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "passive trade in influence and corruption".
Two officials from the Agglomeration of Aubagna, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are examined one for "undertraction and diversion of public property by one person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complexity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "abus of social property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently entered into a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
The investigators suspect that his companies were used to laundering money from great banditism.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails for alleged fraud in public procurement, especially in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubania as well as certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", held the opinion in France, alerted diplomacy, and intensified the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the attention of the U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice on the treatment of their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of grippers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not had the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and sought by the U.S. justice for material trafficking for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put under a strong light how the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it wasn't.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Elysée Counsellor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meets with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to return their own prisoners of force to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "Make constant torture" in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it even more, as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, past the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "the silence will rule nothing", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier adds that arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day when it escapes to the French Embassy) will "need for a large amount of money to be paid to Iranians" (230 000 euros of bail).
And he says that Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
One information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on a judge's order.
The American Embassy, like many observers, wonders about this alarming coincidence.
For Washington, who traces Iran's illegal networks for the acquisition of nuclear equipment, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a merchandise?
The liberation of Iranian against the liberation of French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
Elysée, he said, "was not only completely surprised by the judge's decision," but sought to resist it.
"There were vivid exchanges between the French Presidency and the guardian of seals" (then Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of French intelligence services.
Elysée's advisor consists of a phone number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that Iranian "is currently located in buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée did not manage its efforts, through media releases and "fuites" to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a "important" and "influencing" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles relay the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the "media flash" of French officials.
On which is so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials in private recognize that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then examines the reasons why Elysée was pushing into this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "will validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and unworthy".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "discover to Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "We do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our fellow countryman".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cendrillon" law that prohibits teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, have reported representatives of the Departments of Culture and the Family.
"A lot of children play at these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and right to sleep," said the ministerial officer responsible for the bill, Jo Rin.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the law, he specified.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time for these games for young people whose parents are asking for them, added the responsible.
It will also provide people who demand it with free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the uncontested champion of world online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: the Fifa designates the organizer countries
On Thursday, the Fifa Executive Committee appoints the World Cups organizer countries 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying are likely to take a step on the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa Queen's Competition will take place in Europe, a traditional discipline bastion (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emirate of Qatar, the Heads of Government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measurement of the economic and political challenges of a world.
It is therefore likely that the tracts in the couloirs will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa Evaluation Report, English, Spanish and Portuguese files (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension of two EC members of corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football bulb that hosted the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC released a layer on Monday, by broadcasting a documentary that spings three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to discontent the Fifa and embarrass the English leaders, who have started in an intense lobbying with David Cameron on the first line in recent weeks.
The head of the government hopes to recast the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the organisation of the JO-2012 in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to bring England's blasphemy to the EC?
Nothing is less sure because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any detail with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could sunny their ambitions.
Possible retributions against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rate of Russia, becoming an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings in its record (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and declared "unloyal competition in preparing the vote", in a barely sailed reference to the accusations of the British press against the EC members.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," he launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared as the logical favorites.
First World Economic Power, headquartered by Fifa's leading sponsors, the country seems to have a long advance on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World-2026 to China, which was strongly desired by the Fifa, which would actually make the Asian chances lost by 2022.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by proposing futurist stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries are more at risk than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid by European countries, the nerve of war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have any hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate to Elysée calls another.
So the current Head of State will be candidate in 2012.
But evidently, the mystery share attached to the presidential function is not well cleaned up.
So you have to pretend that there is still doubt.
In one direction as in the other.
In 2006, even without faith, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy, with a serious air, assured that he would take his decision "only in the fall of 2011".
That he mentions in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening in Elysée, the perspective of "two mandates" has thus been a little feverish.
Was that the official announcement of his application?
We were far away.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year-olds to two.
He made an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he talks about the presidential, on the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"The worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the next step."
His speech of yesterday does not make him more candidate than the previous day; they do not make it less.
If they raise comments, that's for a double reason.
Acceleration of the race to the PS application, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to the Segolen Royal lice that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is because its application in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for a more early battle order than expected.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's application to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and carefully responded to the Prime Minister's surroundings.
"If he thinks the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned evidently.
Euro: Enforced ECB to maintain its purchases of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to provide an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt requires, the Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to be as perpetual as it would worsen a situation more than it is today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Last night, at a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it felt that the central bank should do more, e.g. by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners..."
The next day, at his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament in Brussels, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more disquiet about his intentions, simply indicating that the State securities purchase programme on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main direct rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, Treasury bond purchases by the ECB doubled last week to nearly EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretion, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Forecasts of continued procurement among market operators are no doubt (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a significant change in the cap.
If loans of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
The economists now expect this system to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's changing her program significantly."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank economist.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to its intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds in order to create an atonic market", Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to be replaced at any cost by the lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way to prevent the packing of returns paid by the most fragile States," said an important bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly, States will be less embarrassed to reduce their debt, otherwise stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is doing the round back
After an early week of concern for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday with the rebound of bond rates at 10 years old.
A return to the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "unreliable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person then denounced.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 base points and the price of cover contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had flown to 263 points, resulting in a certain breakdown in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the difference with German rates was above 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "most concern" about "the turbulences of the markets" and a possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the aggravation of tax revenues that goes with it, making the state run the risk of being unable to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... whereas the current budget in the Senate is 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
That is why the rumor of a new budget collective that could be put in place after the parties, for a sum of €7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
To date, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have repeated it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy in the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short and long term, because despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts requested by Italy are less than those requested by other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
Remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open a period of less favourable decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anticipating devices
Christine Lagarde tortured him again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that we have shown it again Sunday in day and night, are, of course, solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State obligations brought water to the milling of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk yet about a start of standardization.
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "political time is much slower than market time".
As we are aware of this hiatus and its dangers, European countries intensify discussions in order to strengthen existing antimicrobial systems.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more generally, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also the case with Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform extrem-eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, he will certainly prepare the field.
The first issue of ESF securities is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative entrusted the Reuters agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilised by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are in the lead line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are complementary to closer-to-efficiency measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are at all costs of avoiding seeking international assistance before establishing their own budgetary corrections and deciding what structural reforms are necessary to restore sustainable confidence.
Finally, European donors are relying on the options available to accelerate the process of standardising the markets of sovereign bonds.
From Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first step forward in the idea that if the € 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of about EUR 100 billion would suffice, preferably in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with so far EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were to worsen.
Snow and glass: 24 orange watch departments
Snow episodes continue to cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and glass.
The Eurine, the Eurine and the Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, have added to 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, sustained snowfalls affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowy episodes are significant enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, says Weather France.
In the Côte d'Armor, several departments were banned from heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking its vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was prohibited for Thursday in Picardia.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the traffic of heavy goods vehicles.
The Prefecture "invits all motorists to take the most care on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Branch (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights to Kingssy Paris airport on Thursday and 10 percent to Orly due to future snowfall.
DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial advances
Since the debate on modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has hit its full, the billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we mention 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro that the Society of Grand Paris must build.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the PSC to borrow on the markets a share of its dual loop financing.
Today we finally arrive at the first additions.
The Financial Corrigendum Act 2010, considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special capital tax and an increase in the office tax in Isle of France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is encrypted: "The proceeds of this tax are EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a redeployment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernise it, increase its product and affect it to the Society of Grand Paris".
How much would it be?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources add to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Society of Grand Paris at the time of the project," can be read in the explanation of reasons.
At the SGP, this system is not shocking.
"From the time when revenues are created (the two taxes, ndlr), you can cover three-year studies and then tap into the 4 billion after," explains."
"This will be entered in the budget and taken as it is."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This system, in which the promised 4 billion are still for the abstaining subscribers, is likely to cause a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Vengeance hackers and diligence spies
The WikiLeaks case has double value.
On the one hand, it appears to be a apparent scandal, a scandal that appears to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (from any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could be read for months in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi is owned), and Khadafi's caricatural profile has long been for sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should be composed only of new, already known, is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) repeats exactly what was already written in previous books.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (not know where to look for news about the occult), but because those who devote themselves to occultism only believe in what they already know, and who reaffirm what they had already learned.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of secret services (if he could be, I know, editor at Libération), who only holds true what he recognizes.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
Then why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into spy centres.
Any investigator knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, publicly repeating violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place US diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a significant impact on the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims in crisis as well as the "bourrels".
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
At Orwell's time, we could design all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proved completely since, capable of controlling every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when one proves, as it happens now, that even the crypts of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-directional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen's vengeance - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the chance to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that everything knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means removing all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, States will no longer be able to place any reserved information on the web - this would mean publishing it on a poster glued around the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential relationships by phone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a Head of State moved onto the plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast is science-fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who are moving discreetly into uncontrollable routes, bearing only messages learned from the heart or, at most, hiding the rare written information in a shoe's heel.
The information will be stored in a single copy in closed-to-key drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now progresses in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wireless telegraph (telephony).
The video cassettes (analogical) had enabled cinema researchers to explore a film step by step, moving forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the journeys it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional that the communication policies and techniques come back to horse cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that request confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France spoils its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider compliance with the promises of early and fast-start funding by developed countries.
And the big French craps are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU released the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had reached €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to meet its 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional efforts are made without being at the expense of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what means "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States of which France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start-up funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditures in previous years or at the overall level of public development assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Again there is no rule and everyone chooses how to calculate it.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 loan is equal to €1 given.
Of course, this is hardly justified: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emissions mitigation projects that are based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to a euro that is given... At the most, only the cost of the loan for the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be accounted for under its commitments.
However, France has only made such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making EUR 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check by yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union pays €1 to meet its commitment, France only spends 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice passport tour!
In summary, in its fast start-up financing, France is doing a double fraud: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action in time and, on the other, on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to borrow?) and in the negotiations as the developing countries are not completely dubbed...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be a more sand grain in the vast UNFCCC machine.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn lessons from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could make discussions on the issues of long-term financing progress (other crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would of nature increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Warning children's intake of pesticides
A 10-year-old child intakes 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (ex-Rapport pour les droits et le respect des générations futures).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed but are illustrative of the problem treated", purchased food generally consumed in four meals and one cash in one day by a child of a decade, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - and friandises, have been examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The baseline balance is aggressive: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five carcinogenic substances, and 37 substances that may act as endocrinian disruptors (PE), according to studies conducted by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is well seen in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues that could interfere with the hormonal system.
The apples, imported from Brazil, foreseen as incassed by the study, contain traces of six chemicals, of which a fungicide is forbidden in France.
The same thing for Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide forbidden in the EU.
In addition, the hacked steak, the boxed tuna, and even the bread rod and chewing gum were dampened with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the robinet water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the examination of the plastic base used to warm the meal at the microwave was not free.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on its part, proposed that a moratorium be established on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
