Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33-footing hall at the village park was commissioned in Gutach - in the sights of the old town halls.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shielding?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall lamp was installed at that time because it secured the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The facility officially commissioned yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossroads.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›grub‹.
"The high traffic and pedestrians had to bring another light to their safety," said Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, the municipality of Gutach runs around 12 000 vehicles daily on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy load traffic," Arnold emphasises.
Therefore, the construction of another light is more than necessary: "Safety is simply going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, and a circular traffic was also envisaged, but because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossroads, it was rejected again.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the location selection of the lamp masts before: "With an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden stems, we have tested whether these vehicles can drive out from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without cutting the lamp mast."
The EUR 15,000 expensive lighting system itself is "the most modern thing that is currently on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strong that the lights of the drivers can be well identified, for example, even when the sun is underneath.
And it is also saving: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presss the light button, the upper radar sensor testes the traffic position.
If the road is free, green comes directly for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks if the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people should go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will come safely across the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver here must think as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly the lights for pedestrians showed green, a high-class vehicle came through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hanging to rude violence and dumb sexuality, the tightness and unpleasantness - has often been described by the Poem of Karntner.
The Büchner Prizeträger is known primarily as a prosa author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Weatherlights on the tongue tip", which is now seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a Collage from Prosatexten.
For example, the theatermaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Die Körpereigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie bedauerlich" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requisit: a snouted sofa, on which it is copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
In this case, director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overlaps the template with a lot of directions, known from the repertoire of postdramatic play forms.
The actresses are particularly concerned with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenario implementations.
They are touched hard, dived with the head under water, dragged with their evening rods to the wall.
Obstructed in cellophane or meadows, they stuck on dangerously high punches through the stage, either monologizing them loudly or lying completely confused on the stage floor.
The text, however, is hardly in this effort.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only at the end of the show comes a little quiet, and Winkler's imitation of absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a money source to repair the decaying highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that is located in the luminous board of each car.
The devices that record each driven kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Offices to revise the outdated system for financing US-American roads.
The usually boring area of road planning has suddenly resulted in an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertaries have joined environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometers – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax items.
The tea party is terrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while the Congress cannot agree on action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per driven mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the road signs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we'll only possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driven miles with all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes that US Americans pay at the fence column, is overwhelmed.
But in America, no more do as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even for one cent at high alcohol prices.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with road signs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Officecrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is advisable to urban liberals, for the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce staves and air-safe exhausts.
The California planners are using the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally established climate change objectives.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay according to the route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason Directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a report in 2011, asked the Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the progress and thus responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to leave many miles in everyday life on their way to work or to the city.
Several states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, who currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, among which the ministers of transport of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could pursue any of their movements.
"Defences against Big Brother and such things were a major problem," Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want to.
When the test started, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to convert the tachographs into adult surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, fragmented technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the driven kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would also be more calm to the public.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not begin to assist states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in an emerging vehicle insurance market where drivers were to pay on the basis of the driven miles.
However, the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"The people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners try to give drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officers want to develop a tax device that also allows parking fees to be paid, an insurance must only be paid for driven kilometers and speed data collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid stalls.
"Fahrers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay, officials declared that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume low gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is also sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of the Commission's legislative and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team hits awakener
The volunteer firefighter handled her autumn main sample despite lack of personnel with bravoness.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise.
There should have been a short closing when sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, but one of them could send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer's first examination of the situation, two breath protectors of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead to free.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy because a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated storage for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machinery for wood processing.
The first discharge was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place via an overflow hydraulic at about 100 meters away.
Now, three solutions were designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also going to show what can be done with little staff.
In serious cases, support will be provided through the Königsfeld day operation group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Significant networking of universities and companies
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee New Town of where the workers from tomorrow came from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he and the senior heads of the vocational schools, as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the chairman of the parent council, followed this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model training projects.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in the forest city between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and the Occupational School Centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to look at the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, to the phase of care for families," Wolf said.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were taking care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without employer support, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies often retain the regional economy with its acquired knowledge and skills, which helps to strengthen the region," the President of the Landtag showed himself convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered could the needs of skilled workers be covered.
In his view, the location advantage of the county is its advantageous location in southwest Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his train ride from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Stay stubborn and make sure that public transport improves," he explained to the local politicians present.
With music experience a entertaining afternoon
Already for 15 years, the Kaul family invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and a vesper.
Earlier, the older citizens were hosted in the resting place.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the Nursing House of St. Josef.
The residents looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage.
With common melodies, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich spoke.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old schoolyard before the renovation to the Kirchstraße is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was built in the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, to stabilize and static relief of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
The further approach provides that Alexander Misok from the Brüunlinger Stadtbauamt will include the Land Memorial Office in the plans and create a renovation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine the further approach.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, patching and planting of the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, a follow-up must be made to the renovation of the renovation-necessary limiting wall from the ground and placed on new construction.
The historical, one hundred years old delimitation wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, need to rehabilitate and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of crash.
A stable wall is a precondition for one of the students to use schoolyards, which has been done through the current fastening work.
Initially, school court renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures were shifting.
An important word in the historical renovation of school walls, which has already been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the State Memorial Office.
If the requirements come from this side, the city of Bräuunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunling Grundschule, who are now being taught again in a well-sanified old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir will receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now been involved.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart Music University," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, which is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in Stuttgart at the Bundestagswahl on 22 September, is opposed to the Green-Red State Government.
This will force on the basis of an expert study a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
The course of Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug trafficking
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators discovered and shut down a "Super tunnel" for drug trafficking.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and a ventilation system.
So three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through under the radar," said the U.S. Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where this was discovered an end of the tunnel.
Duffy assured the drug bands: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the heavy equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took over a year.
The rail system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the seizure of marijuana.
All three threaten to be the highest penalty for lifelong deprivation, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels had been discovered, said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug bands whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman from the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They would do everything they can to get to the United States.
No details were given about the arrested, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
They have to count on imprisonment for up to ten years.
2014 Become Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
The recurrence of the first explicit mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in more than eight weeks, the anniversary year will come.
Geisinges and Church Houses were for the first time explicitly mentioned together.
A document was produced in churches where both places were mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official opening to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event takes place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, many events are planned both in Geisingen and in Church Houses.
Church Houses will be the 1250 in July on a weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this weekend there is also the church-house church festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote for the city on the occasion of the anniversary a commission composition, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Sunnwend celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is at the end of the last week of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geising City Jubilee, a new Chronicle will also be released.
"But it should not only be a chronology by Geisinges themselves, but also a printed work on today's gedicht, which consists of Geisinges, Church Houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's gestures celebrated 2014 birthday, 1974 the today's space was completed with the communions.
The new Chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversarys.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a regular evening on the occasion of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years old and has the festive banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4th.
The old Leipferdingen works are 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music association is 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was mentioned for the first time in a gift certificate, owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then court.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years behind the municipal reform.
Council takes rail systems into sight
Should the train passage "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway track next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of rail crossings - regular collisions of trains with other vehicles occur across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they will have to participate in the costs of one third, the rest of the railways and the alliance will share.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality council the specialities of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an ex-booking at the height of the tunnel wall west of the railroad.
There are also larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, which could be in counter traffic without having to block the track.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was debated controversially in the municipal council, since some councils questioned the need for road spreading: Thomas Kipp put the mood of critics on the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The "Hirschen" train crossing is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route on the Heberles Bridge because they could not turn there to the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
As it should be foreseen that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the train crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be an important traffic condition for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to let the costs of the proposed spread of the road be investigated.
Nonetheless, the construction of the train transition was approved by a majority, provided that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards the "Bahn Station Road" for meeting traffic to approximately 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the transformation of the train transition at the Trautwein Gerbeerei could lead to a completely different problem affecting access to the rapidly rising "Gerolltzhausweg".
The administration had the train's conversion plans investigated by Breinlinger's engineering office, since it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg would then be possible without any further delay.
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to exclude that road inclination conditions could lead to longer seats of vehicles.
In turn, the city is responsible for this as a road loader.
As a result, the restructuring could lead to liability disputes.
As both the timber supply and the deflection worked in the current state of expansion, it was not supposed to agree to the changeover, Haas argued.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other train crossings, because directly next to the centre stop to which a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked at this point to the extent that no collision threatens.
Most of them refused to agree to the conversion of this train transition, since the city of Schiltach would have to "bade out" the problem of seating vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction.
The panel considers the changes to the train crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements have already been concluded with the train.
Esa decides on large space missions: billions of missions
Far planets, gravitation waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far-distance worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there's a life on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for sublime planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are raised by the responsible members of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to make research a decisive step forward.
The budget for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of them have now come to the closest choice.
Numerous bodies review the proposals and apply to researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, the Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in vocabulary darkness.
A large infrared leescope in the universe could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life occur there?
To address this issue, the "Cheops" space telescope will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our nearest surroundings will be examined more closely.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could picture pervasive planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide information on the conditions for the formation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as its particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be exemplified.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a M-Class mission (where the budget lies at about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Juice Sonde (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the Ice Monde Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there may also be variations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How has the universe emerged and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the primitive.
In addition to our common matter, which consists of stars, planets and living creatures like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
To date, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first parts of the Urknall, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M mission, which is scheduled to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky and thus allow for conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best opportunities for an authorisation as a L mission have, in the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Under this, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could do this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission has a two or three probes detector stationed in the universe.
He could, in contrast to earthly installations, also demonstrate gravitational waves that have arisen during the rush, thus providing new knowledge of the formation of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", to explore, among other things, black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", to detect and investigate remarkable planets.
Among other things, proposals have already been made on the re-transport of samples from Mars, on the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids and on solar physics.
Snowden willing to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Federal Day if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not answer their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a treasury and attempt to criminalise political expression with a criminal threat, where no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to allow this."
The relationship between the United States and Germany is burdened by the claims that the NSA has listened to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, said that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible, 'without risking him and ruining the relationship with the United States'.
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs a assurance that he is "safe" there, according to the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he sees himself subjected to a "reasonable and ongoing" persecution campaign that had expelled him from his home.
However, it is affected by the global response to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the disclosures of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, 'when the problems relating to the humanitarian situation were solved'.
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to dump hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for one piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire dose.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags below the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that it was calculated 25 US dollars if the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid on the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
'We do not want to calculate this amount,' she said.
In 2008, airlines started to charge fees for the first and second luggage given.
Passengers who tried to avoid them have therefore put as much as possible in their handbags, which means that the luggage bags are often overfilled above the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who clearly expressed that it will become increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a luggage free of charge at the Frontier airport, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they arrived at the airport.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only enter into force in summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often shy by baggage supplements and other charges, but airlines like to take it back.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new luggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of flights after years of losses.
Most of them, however, leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first charges for hand luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a cheap air carrier.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional charges.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that the hand luggage fee for Spirit will bring US$50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the airline if passengers were faced with the company's unusual luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth knees and handful discussions at the airway.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went like slimed."
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the entire dose and refill coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had tried shortly in 2008 to demand money for refreshment drinks, but seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company had been imprisoned.
Frontiers step to collect charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchases instead of via an online travel agency.
However, frontier has gone the farest in this area.
In September, the company began to spend only half as many miles on an online travel agency when booking.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25% of the flight route.
Therefore, a flight with a frontier booked with a third party will only bring customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve places only when purchased directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer tribe at its headquarters in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The revenue declined by 9 per cent and the flight capacity decreased by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published by the parent group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier as part of the company's sale.
Spokeswords come from the Bible
Around 40 women visited the last women’s breakfast this year in the Evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house were "Languages from the Bible" and "Languages from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, talked to the Bible’s words.
"Languages contain wisdom, regulations or warnings," she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wood eye be watchful, as shovels fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, the Lord gives it in sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners on what proverb it was.
The speeches from the Middle Ages were adopted by the church councillor Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, a little crushing.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speech phrases she called "Brücken in the past".
At the end, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, mayor Roman Waizenegger was also mixed up.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unlearned tourism
A pilot project for the tourism sector is launched at the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already unskilled in the industry are to be qualified to specialists in hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with graduations," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that a “internal error” and not hacker are faulty at the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency explained late Friday that an error had paralyzed their public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for a few hours this night, since an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spying agency explained in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users.
Previously, NSA spoke to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "no compromise" in any way.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website crashes.
Cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not used to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname once was No Search Agency (No such authority), is now found in the light of the public and looks after the revealings of its extensive surveillance programme in the last few months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculations that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyprus operation.
The number of people without a job is slightly reduced by 22 to 1.307 in October.
Although the ratio was 3.1 percent better than last year and even better than in September, "but we would have hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have so far reacted to attitudes.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Builder, "We have hardly any professionals in craftsmanship, health care and old-age care".
Job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been available again since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Profit losses in Bombardier after decrease in delivery and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decrease in net profit after it had been under pressure due to declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use next September in accordance with the ambitious schedule.
Only three further starts have been made on the test aircraft's Jungfernflug before and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a price crash of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his assessment of "outperform" to "sector perform" with a view to the limited price potential of the stock in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery rates for aircraft were expected as much as possible, we are clearly disappointed by the development of the margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
To date, however, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new nozzle aircraft are appropriate.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that while the plane's standing time, soil tests and software updates have been set up.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to start a first flight and then set up a review period, as we have done.
This is happening throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, said it from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical about whether 12 months after the Jungfernflug, the first customer can operate an airplane of the CSeries.
Bombardier said it would review and update the plan for launching (EIS) in the coming months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even though it clearly corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardiers' net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Turnover declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer worldwide reports that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the aviation and space sector was $32.9 billion on September 30, and was thus unchanged compared to December 31st.
"In the field of aviation and space, the results were within the framework of our guidelines, but the low entry of orders and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Turnover in the aviation and space sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
On September 30, the order stock in the transport sector was $32,6 billion, slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by the resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate management, new requirements will be provided for the fourth quarter.
In mid-day trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share declined by 8.5 percent and amounted to 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google Financial Board Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent decrease in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport manager informed via the short news service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported the man was dead.
A securityman was also killed.
The media also reported several injured persons.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed about the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses reported having seen a shooter with a gun in one of the flight halls, as reported by several media.
A traveler told the broadcaster CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and kids cryed.
Among the waiting was panic outbreaking, many had been hiding from fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA security officer has suffered a shooting injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
Afterwards he had been brought to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are supposed to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On TV images there were many medical and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were put in security from the building.
Users published photos on Twitter of a special operation command and a gun on the ground.
As the airport line informed on Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, formed a long backbone.
Until landing, air traffic had been temporarily discontinued, it was said.
However, several airlines were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss from police investigation has to go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, continued information about underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpooler Crown Court
A well-known defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations on its activities in drug trafficking after he had been compromised by his own cocaine infection.
The lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials observed Scarborough (32) delivering three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner in the lawyer's chamber.
The investigation showed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police under a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of house searches worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, forwarded information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpooler Crown Court, following a three-week trial, in two charges for disability of justice.
He admitted the possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs in a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage tone.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was in the Ewood Park Blackburn Rovers football stadium at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was known that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but refused to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that their discussion was subject to the 'advocate secret'.
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken a hair sample.
During the police interrogation he announced that he operated an office both under his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him home for legal matters.
It was known before the court that he had appealed to important drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed the investigators about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not violated."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a defender, because he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He had an impact on police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus dismissed his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta indicated every misconduct and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the Lancashire police: "Mr Ditta has taken the step from a defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost this confidence and tried to slip behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning for criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total penalty of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the conclusion of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the songkranz Dunningen will embrace two services with the "German Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which enthusiasticed the audience this spring this year, the song crane will, at the end of the anniversary year, enrich two services with the performance of the German trade fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday 26 October, this extraordinary trade fair will be held at the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen from 19 onwards and on Sunday 27 October at 10.15 p.m. in the church of St. Johannes Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called German trade fair with the original title "Sings for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the trade fair", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of birth.
The trade fair is presented in the context of the service, as the commissioner Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the bubble group of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis deviates with confidence
With the 2015 elections to the parish council, for example, the Secular Care Unit Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is only one common parish for all six parishes.
During a joint meeting on Saturday, the panels of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactoryly as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the scepticism of the new one deviates with a hesitation.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish priesthood, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the principal officials of the Seal Care Team were extended.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained, on the basis of a presentation, the new guidelines for secular care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will form a public law body which enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a joint parish and a council of foundations in which the parisher's power office is represented.
There should be at least two elected members from each parish, in which six parishes are formed on site so-called community teams.
It will be their job in the future to promote church life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parish was then highlighted by considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that the accumulated funds will remain dedicated to the parishes.
In contrast, debts are transferred to the total community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then affects all parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only projects that could be handled by the individual parishes have been invested," relativized Haslach's pastorial president Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes, Barbar Ritter, described the chairman of the panel in the Seal Care Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006 they had made themselves the task of "being one, staying five" and had to find out that this is not so easy at all.
The Haslacher Seal Care Unit's bodies then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be conceived at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, the parish community Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must set themselves up for higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed in relation to the South Kurier, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year is paid to a four-person Pfullendorf family.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase of the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy will be re-fixed each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity routes.
These amounts to the additional costs arising from the energy conversion, which they can collect through a levy over the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf city works form the last member in this chain.
According to Jörg-Arne Bias, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company was even based on a higher levy in its forecasts.
Now the actual payments will have to be calculated before the city plants could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, where the number will be more close to the 2 cents.
Light on permanent red: Watch the waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do - driving red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue," explains Stuttgart's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate" which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before starting with a malfunction of the lights.
However, whoever continues the journey despite red lights must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who waits less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the lights after about three minutes of permanent red and had to be responsible for a negligible red light breach.
The lamp was not defective, but jumped slightly later on to green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
Municipal Council is delighted about a sound budget
Every time it's about the budget in municipal council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 financial statements.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget with around €7.6 million was over €1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around one million euros above the approach, with around EUR 1.8 million.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of the income tax.
The real estate budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As investments have been made less than planned in the financial year 2012, the addition of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve has been increased by around 2.1 million euros to now totalling 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of the sleeve," praised Gerster with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the councils of the congregation were clearly delighted about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has in the past been able to waive high rates.
However, Gerster said that this would have often cut subsidies from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory bases.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain rates of increase.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments will come for which we would like to receive subsidies in the coming years," Gerster announced in this connection.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
With 60 years of age as singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the herb festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir that has been won more than love.
In the association, Wermter was also active, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and loyalty to his association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Referent on behalf of the Cacilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him - since the choir is also a choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues gave him the document of the German choir association as well as a graviered zinc cellar.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in usual railways: with the MGV Betra, the songkranz Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the full mariners had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which the 400 visitors discussed.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with humorous songs such as "In Wine Paradise" and "Luxurious, your brothers".
Your Honorary Singer Hubert Wermter prepared a little piece of honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classic choir songs like "Jachterwerbung" by Julius Wengert, "Great, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir" - the song crane of Salzstetten provided for the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulse choir" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" in domestic file, where the full-marine music club offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the children worked well at lunch.
Children's Dreams Will Be True
In these days, the children's gardens and day-care facilities in the customs district receive mail.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkassen Zolleralb, wants to assist the institutions in fulfilling their wishes for construction and enrichment.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Participating in the action can include all kindergartens, dayclubs and child crèches from the entire customs district.
If you have a wish for construction or enrichment for your facility, you can apply with this at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Messengers, Bauhaus and Sparkassen Zolleralb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realised with a maximum value of 2000 euros and on a (actional) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to take care of many busy builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press is upset by controversial media law
'We are in a scary situation, and you may ask yourself: what does Parliament refuse to simply abolish judicial independence tomorrow?' was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be inconstitutional.
"The law is draconical and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media court 'will always be preceded because it is an extended arm of the government' and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
'I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament', he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, by means of the new law, "the media are effectively seized," whereas it writes The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconical".
The adoption of the law is part of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks of armed Islamists on the West Gate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media raised the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping centre.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a shout from the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished with up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, 'one single penalty can force most radio stations into bankruptcy'.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on their description according to Kenya's 'living blogosphere'.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist of the nation, who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"They leave politicians themselves, lead the country into bankruptcy and return to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already in the past raised the public trouble.
In May they agreed to cancel the reductions ordered by the National Compensation Commission and re-established their solid salaries of approximately 532,000 Schilling tax-free per month – they are among the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will be true for the FC
The official inauguration celebration for the art lawn sports site, despite the cold weather and the rain, did not make any sense to the importance of the city and the football club.
It may have been a more pleasant time to celebrate last Saturday, but Peter did not want to attend.
So all those who came without a umbrella or could not hold one of them for any reason.
This was done to the musicians who were frameing the festive act, as did some speakers.
Nass became the FC president, Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were paid to all the mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who took part.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The famous pensioners placed 400 square meters of patch stones for the new pathways.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the Landtag member Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the District Chairman of the South Bad Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalls that in spring and autumn, recurring whitening-related influences were such that he could not be played at the original lawnplace.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first reflections on the solution of the problem when the construction of a third place at the football club or at the real school at Salinensee was thought.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts about setting up an artificial lawn sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plannings were initiated two years ago when the FC took over the canvas in inheritance lease, awarded a cost contribution of €100,000 for the construction of the square and approved the country funding of €104,000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros, and Klumpp summed up.
The start of the 68-fold 108-metre artificial grass site took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were deducted, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of home affairs and justice.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Party on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This should include the issue of double citizenship, where both sides have opposite ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not in the order of the meeting this Friday, the SPD supported its refusal to a car toll required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "fleat rate for multiple vehicles and thus environmentally counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat to road avoidance on land roads, which were already an accidental priority.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be only a first step from the point of view of Pronold.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be abolished at a later time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hairwave on the open light stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be the right summer again?" was not the question on Friday evening on the open light stage Killesberg.
It was indeed a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Drivers severely injured in the event of accident
In the event of an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen has been seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch travelled on the Kempener external ring towards Grefrath at 21.15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left on the street of St. Töniser, she overseeed the coming car of the 37-year-old.
The wheelchair collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: locking after an accident on the skanzlekreisel
The accident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out to the city on the left track of the two-seaway Reichenau on Thursday evening, at 8 p.m.
Shortly before the circular traffic at Schünzle, he noticed that he was on the left-wing track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand track.
There was a collision with the 23-year-old BMW.
The VW Passat behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
A total of around 15,000 damages occurred, the police reported.
The track had to be locked during the accident capture, it continued.
Vienna Airport creates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Bypassing how this will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the speaker's transmissions is thus lost - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced in relation to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of passages for individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning the noiseing calls.
Because of the disappearance of these passages - an average of about 200 personal calls from the speakers in one day - it is expected to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passages have been seen relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight climbs or departure times here a little less," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking car with tractors, there is a second competition at the autumn farm festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday 7 September, the Highlander Games start at 13:30.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabically hooked on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of throwing tree stems, throwing hoods and carrying water.
The tree stem is four and a half metres long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't matter to the widest extent," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be discarded vertically, once overlapped and then come to bed.
This is evaluated with most of the points.
When you throw a hufe, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters away is thrown onto a pot.
Skills and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water timber carried over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a botch are measured at the end.
Two of each "clan" or team are then allowed to participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition are awarded prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the racers can join in the Scotch rock.
But also weak temptation is allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury still gives a few bonus points.
You can log in until an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been recommended on Saturday at the festival.
In the evening, the bubble music friends come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Birabohemical Blasmusik from Schömberg is designed for the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays polka and fairy tale.
However, her repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a solid big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and blackworst baron, will be present in the midst of the rhinestones.
In Dornhan he already appeared at the Christmas Market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the music club will enjoy Leinstetten at the early chess, at 2 p.m. the farmer chapel Böffingen will be invited to attend, and the "Oldies" will then make the party sound.
The stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf is already started on Friday.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions of companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheepshes.
Specially for children there is a streak zoo, Strohhüpfburg, tractor driving (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
Organisers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Zündkapsele".
Milk and egg alternatives in overview
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Paired tofu with vegetable soap is for example a quarry substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation also refers to the World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt lets replace with soya yogurt.
Instead of milk, soybean, oat, almond or resin milk could be used.
Replace traditional seeds.
There are also plant alternatives for eggs.
For example, half a broken, mature banana can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mouse or a dining cup of ground linen seed plus three dining cups of water are suitable for this purpose.
For example, the dough is looser instead of egg with a mixture of a tea cup of baking powder, a dining cup of food starch and three dining cups of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soya yogurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight it immediately started to Brooklyn Bridge, which reached at foot the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous Skyline, which makes a special attraction in the eveninglight.
As a result of the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithfully to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day at Times Square was decided.
Despite Shutdown, the freedom statue was reached on the second day with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, the financial centre around Wall Street went to the commemorative place of 11 September.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373 metres high view platform of the Empire State Building and enjoy the view.
Afterwards, the Rockefeller Center, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay shortly in the autumn sun, was driven through the New York streets.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school everyday at the Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the day of the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertus fair is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the saga after a rather disrespectful hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn bubbles group of the hunting threw Westphalia under Brigitte Kluth's leadership musicizes on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, original French melodies.
The bubbles wear horseback clothing because they mainly accompany horse riders, horses and dog mosquitoes on sledge hunting musically.
The ceremony will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed surf shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
Déjà Vu, according to Lexicon, is called a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In case of a visit to the same name café at the Opschlag in the district city of Kleve in sight to the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the cafe with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but hand-resistant always experienceable.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A glimpse into inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at an early stage.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café ambit looks like a place to feel comfortable.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top confuses the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made themselves a name before the opening of the elegant café at the shop as gastronomers: in Kranenburg they led the Art Lounge.
From the move to Kleve at the affair, the sympathic cafe lovers hope more audience.
Not least also through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner stresses.
Rather, the two young students here want to speak the same way as seniors and all age classes between them.
About coffee lovers.
The sympathic owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the scenting hot brewery in the various variations itself.
Expressophan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," the NRZ tells her.
There were two events in the bright cafe.
Better, one thing.
Because the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a strong fan of events even for this reason: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always only speak to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the very normal operation as little as possible."
Should be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
Regarding the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the Opslag in Kleve.
The road, which increasingly develops into a gastronomic milestone.
To the pleasure of many clevers, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the Gastromeiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival at which the MGV invited "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious coexistence entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivity to make honors.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was made by writer Rolf Wagener this time.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also turned so many rounds for us, for our sincere thanks," says Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for the participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity kits were awarded this year to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations.
Place five ranked grade guard Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was sent by the board to the team of Vereinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets at his regular choir samples every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club room.
"New sang-frequent voices are always warmly welcome to us," Schlotmann says.
UN Announces New Goals in Combating Poverty
The United Nations immediately begins with the development of a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago for poverty reduction.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the advancement of “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They have been included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
On the evening at the summit, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the time had come to 'think beyond national interests'.
"I am delighted that the Member States have agreed to launch a process with which universal, sustainable development objectives should be agreed," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four games days, good mood continues to prevail in the handball superligists.
That's what coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the Thirdliga reserve from Fredenbeck has currently not ripped out any trees, Malmon raises the point finger in advance.
Many players I have still trained in the A-young.
Therefore they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-trainer.
"In addition, it is important to wait for further reinforcement from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
To finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
Especially in the cover work and the switching game, the last time it was huge.
There is also a need to improve the use of opportunities.
So I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns are growing in Mozambique in the face of collisions between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state-founder and the first president of Mozambique, to support a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription 'We demand security' in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the capital's independence square.
For two weeks there have been reports almost daily of collisions between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebellion movement, initially supported by the Belarusian Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to a growing conflict, but the recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas in front of the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent collisions by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional highburg of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government forces attacked Renamo base points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesperson to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collisions and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a 'losser' who 'will use all its remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government'.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted by the words, Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
By contrast to FT, he said that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
'Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,' said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions that have been fired by a number of collisions this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who hit the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mosambik expert.
None of them is good in negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pressing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to achieve concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election successes have declined since 1992, while a newer party, which is likely to improve in the elections by a former Renamo member's Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM).
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the President's office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out unresting attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in Beira, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale are used to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not well," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration over the government," says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life", says an author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against smart tricks", and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "too wild, too crushing and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a 'scrupulous selection' of old-fashioned works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who were 'examinably educational' children would 'pleasantly shut down' because in entertaining stories the messages would be 'underswell'.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angelsaxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse myths and the British Folk Valley, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
The greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy end, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be subtlely represented, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob retired in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years lived in the "Friyard".
The many viewers were enthusiastic about the extremely short-term scene game.
From the arrival of the award of honorary citizenship to his death, script author and Hansjacob performer Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that received great applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children's heavens, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his paraderoll as the great son of the city.
Stilecht performed by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the "Schwarzschwälder Füchsen" and the "Schwarzschwälder Füchsen".
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimik and gesture.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitable selected music pieces and rounded the performance.
Heinz Winkler, mayor of Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler, was honored to award the honour of the citizen, who, together with a part of the City Council, was represented by the then official Hättich.
Their waiting then made the three-king singers who caused Hansjakob to call: "Ah, as beautiful, once again youth memories of my own three-king time will live".
With their song "O Jesuslein" they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the Storchentags children with their loud "out, out".
His criticism of the official church had at that time expressed Hansjakob's concerns about the outbreaks in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A calm spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene.
Many applause and many praiseworthy words were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: the hope of the Neckar giants grows
The opportunities for the league remains of the sportively declining Ludwigsburger Bundesliga Basketballballer have increased.
For if there is a wild card procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball Project renounces an application for a possible backer place.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said Pascal Roller, former national player, who has set up the concept of a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure, as long as it is not established that Düsseldorf is not licensed," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic Bundesliga fit.
To date, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The Arbitration Court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Night meal church returns to the point of view
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year-old Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its public theme tours this year on Sunday, 27 October, the evening meal church.

Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. home affairs.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-olds in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency on the basis of a reference to non-notified circles familiar with the situation.
It said that such a question could be solved inter-stately.
A trip to Snowdens from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he loses refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Since Germany was a US ally, Snowden threatens to deliver, it continued
Long breath is paid
Six teams fought for the winner's title at the club's tennis tournament.
At the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.

With his savings, a pair of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop bowl, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrille's Pipsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hull.
The company has just several irons in fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard uses, among other things, wind farm logistic.
Black shines the coal on the warehouse in front of the dike.
Distribute or load the coal here, if necessary, two huge blue hulls and rechargers.
At every movement of the cover equipment, a shrilly warning noise sounds over the site.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unsatisfactory wind, this is widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the lawsuits very seriously and has therefore taken contact with the persons concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept silent with technical measures.
In the future, he will also set up an open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot left at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 meters deepened bedside form terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can also be finished here.
"This year we want to knock the 3-million-ton mark on the cover," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, more than 5 million tonnes of coal import per year are realistic.
The three ship chargers on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketballer in spite of first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism among the basketballers of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to win even against the best team in Europe of the past two years," bailed Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first created the art piece to convert a 15-point backstand 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Pireus gave a turn to the game again.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague championship, but then made a slight mistake again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of Munich who had celebrated significant victorys in the first two parties against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title player Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, Variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferenceman at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd of jokes in the form of a conversation.
Fay's innovation has been developed over the years, as last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution of Caroline, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known to appear in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefiz event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has also grown the world of comedy.
A number of comedians who attend the festival this year have become known about rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-sleep Fantasy Football Series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation at both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on races W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the largest visitors magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has evolved into a prestigious TV and film director and an inofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a TV program entitled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he walks through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran will be satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veterans and Germany.
"After years there is now an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of recent years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear leader's negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will find a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Kill Boys Game Cameline with Machete
Two children have confessed the murder of a 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to hunt with them for birds.
With machets and knives armed on Tuesday, they threw the 11-year-old and threw the body into a fountain, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in a working quarter in front of their homes.
The body was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half sister of the young man who had taken her should testify that she was sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the tather course before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly called a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily sent to a psychiatric youth centre.
Inmates must go to prison
The Landgericht Constance has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years imprisonment because of exploitable human trafficking, seizure, threat, insult and dangerous body injury.
The former federal military, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in a process agreement.
So in five cases, he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he posted after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of women who bought him for some years.
Through the confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards, he undertook contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who conveyed the women, he brought them to various boards in the southwest.
There he partially monitored them to control their revenues.
In court, the accused first claimed that he suffered a severe trauma after his colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental restriction and thus about limited debt, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any more of the injured women.
As reported by a Kripo officer, after a first announcement, at least four other cases of exploitable trafficking in human beings could be identified through telephone surveillance.
The hearings had been marked by high aggression.
In later hearings, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, in which one of the women in the whole body had discovered blue spots, had not made any statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality", which considers violence and exploitation in this metre to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He had dissolved himself from these circles and wanted to live a completely normal life after detention," he said.
Oil price continues to fall up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, after worrying about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hunger manufacturing sector in China is growing.
In the late morning in Europe, the reference oil destinations for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in the electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices over the past few weeks.
The US Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there was evidence of increased demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates the continued recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after the lowest in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A Federal Appeals Court in the United States blocked on Thursday the order of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk programme ("Staying and searching") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Appeal Court stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until a decision had been taken to appeal the city.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the program for maintaining and interrogating persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the corrective measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the Appeals Court heard the arguments regarding the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she violated the code of conduct of the US judges by establishing that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the rights of tens of thousands of people because they in an inappropriate way targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York declared itself ready to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were redismissed after police control.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic was criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been in different forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to an all-time height of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint which developed into a collective complaint.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police, and influence the way other police officers use the regulation.
Opponents are of the opinion that the changes would alleviate the morality of the police, but not criminality; also, money would be wasted and the broader problem of a police force, which is under pressure after thousands of jobs have disappeared in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-free practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way in which the NYPD's controls were implemented.
From the happiness of the dreaming camels
Lucky is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the "Help Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the 10th birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already show considerable successes.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Afterwards, a further cooperation was developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the bets were shown on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could make a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, intends to work in an advisory role in the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a painful quarter on the edge of the capital, in the record time of just a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be removed in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a doctor, she says, for example, an acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to attend in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, compound materials, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colony by telling from Mauritania of Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and painting the experiences of Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the association on their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of audit as a young member.
When he became aware of how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in trying to confirm a false tip about a relationship between the former Minister of Interior Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voice mails, and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court heard.
"In the opinion of the Attorney General, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them on fresh acts, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said that NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories exploratoryly: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He rejects this, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
rumors about a Clarkes affair were first picked up by the feature editorial of NotW, when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time when the searches were running, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Pawlby, in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the surveillance of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted with a married woman because of a relationship when he himself was lodged with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married then.
Coulson and Brooks argued that they had promised to hack telephones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In fact, in protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will take the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will end without results.
In the conflict about the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered themselves in a sackgasse after a failed conciliation meeting.
Although President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations in the Paris Elysée Palace on Thursday, he also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 % tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite side also remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, said Jean-Pierre Louvel, Head Association of Profi Clubs (UCPF).
The games held between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2.
Chases: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechenen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and present ideas.
He made it clear: "The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which was unprepared on May 15, 2009, had been a narrowing event that raised the question of safeguards for the future, says Häusler.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
Based on the planning of protection against a flood to be expected statistically every 100 years according to German weather service.
Climate change is taken into account by an increase of 15%.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Koußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect national grants of around 70 percent.
He pointed out, however, that funding is only available if a comprehensive approach is implemented.
The municipality is dependent on the participation of its citizens.
A difficult planning and approval procedure should be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the flow of the Irm liquid from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the proposed measures to achieve the desired objective in the sum.
In addition, you should find the most economical solution, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
There was unfortunateness among residents of the old town, who, even in normal storms, are suffering from overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in administration and first steps have already been taken.
He pointed out, however, that the directives for channel systems were different than for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that rain events for two to three years could be handled.
To dimension the sewage channels larger, would swallow millions.
Seriously injured after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured on Landstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police blocked the road immediately, but could say little about the accident.
However, there are several witness statements that should first be evaluated.
The 19-year-old director of a VW golf driven towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles blew together, and the woman was so stuck in so hard that the firefighter needed almost half an hour to get her out of the carwreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both accidents arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route remained fully closed for about two hours.
He could be called the US Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a scientist of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories have also something serial.
Incredibly the relationship in the outside: the sparkling eyes, the bark, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski can be understood with his massive work as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, which is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Publisher, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security waist and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs in his brain.
He realized, early, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguished a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" comes from 1956 and flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles us terribly, mutants look into the future - and the police attack.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the Chief of the Authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, for this we have a criminal camp full of pesudovers." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things are happening, and prevent the criminal idea from being implemented into action.
Dick's narrative works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the hearing robbery of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Takes mistakes and sacrifices not only in purchase, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means always getting closer to the truth.
Proof of Merkels in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. shore store of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorney could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-olds in Russia, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, Green-Bundestag Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the relationship.
NSA disclosures strengthen corporate paranoia for state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. external post located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BBT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the USA and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US did not use opportunities for foreign spying "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former Whistleblower, has started publishing his full horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the floor to the director.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and purchased data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company's paranoia to a new peak because of state supervision.
The facade to cross brought the disclosure that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was attached, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into the vision, business management will certainly also have potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the USA now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data stealing, such a survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, in the documents sent through by Snowden, there has been no evidence to date that the United States has passed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical refinement of the US spying authorities discovered by the Snowden disclosures have shocked companies who had previously seen the greatest risk of spying in China.
Cloud computing is making a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the United States is subject to their jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, the disclosures of US data mining activities with Prism rejected about ten percent of the non-US members' plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that had not existed a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they are physically kept in this legal area?"
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be watched at all costs.
The fact that economic spying takes place is not a surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, President of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The company management does not usually talk about the countermeasures that have been taken, because it gives attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been blown in that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or unwatchable letting a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, mildly said.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Executive Board member of Audi car manufacturers, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listeners.
The German BVT advises managers to use easy prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away after that.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leader in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," the BAT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimates were ranked France, Russia and Israel behind China in two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the Board of Directors of a German Blue-Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spying, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Secret Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The Secret Service knows very precisely that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as the wedding party at least succeeded, gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept back.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In front, the dresses are often equipped and embroidered, often with a sleeve, while in the back they go down the back and end often in a sleeve.
However, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasises, from the fashion house dresser müller.
For men, the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen cream-coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the local, has been explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
Whoever wants to go ahead with the truck, your link has an offer for him.
"But kisses are also popular for boy-friends," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
The "After-Wedding-Photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - that is, recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding boards, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dogfriends Successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful in a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in candel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he achieved 94 points in the class beginners and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month Marley he took it with 87 points in place 12.
With her Woody in class 1, Susi Höpp was the critical view of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenage's parents, whose body was found in a rolled ringer mat in his high school gym, are convinced that her son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found in an upright mat that stood behind the tribune in the school tournament hall on 11 January.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubts.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never thought he died as the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that any logic does not violate the laws of physics as well as the sound mind," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their Son.
"Your son went to school and came back in his body bag," he commented.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation on Johnson's death, since a number of important issues were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of the consequences of "position-related suffocation".
However, a second autopsy had caused another cause of death, says Moore.
'There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed,' he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he would commission the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in South Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos that the investigators checked.
The teenage's parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained indications of how he died.
CDC publishing allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such directives that the U.S. government has issued, as the number of schoolable children with food allergies increases.
One of 20 children in the United States now has food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees and how to deal with children who are allergic.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The federal legislators have recently amended the regulations so that schools can keep epinephrin more easily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: 'It feels like something presses my tongue', 'My tongue feels like a hair' or 'my tongue scratches'.
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex indefinitely"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
According to the new law, parents must no longer declare sex for such children but can indicate "undefined" or "undefined" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make any overhauled decisions regarding operations for the sexual allocation of newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
An intersexual person, according to BBC, said years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the lickwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
An estimated one of the 2,000 children is not born as a boy or girl every year.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group covered by the diagnosis of sexual disorder (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germs (egg stoves or hottes) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States suggest that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible, and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before, if any, an operation is decided.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law 's sounds like a good thing'.
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not have this," he said.
You can make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersexuals are differentiated from transsexuals or transgenders, because their status is not gender-related but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were demonstrated in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexuals and transgenders in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or 'third sex'.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first “sexless” person after a court had granted lifelong maintenance of an “undefined” sex status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs will have a third assignment, X for intersexuals, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French delegates from the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "sex theory" should be removed from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also expressed its opposition to the German law, explaining: "If the world is diverted into a new state where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would feel better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"Parenthood is already stressful, even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine considered the sex as something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt.
But nowadays, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feel when he grows up with the sex assigned to him.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called a ‘psychic emergency’," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals is based on Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins University, who was of the opinion that the sex was formable.
He marked the concept of "sex identity" and argued that social and environmental attacks – as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterised whether a person considered himself a male or a female person.
However, in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He told the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off when he was cut out, to cast the child completely and also to remove his hoods and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he returned to the male sex and married a woman.
But with 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the Internet's introduction, survivors of these sex operations have become public, who are 'unhappy with the result'.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were unclear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a 'satisfactory life' as a man.
So his external organ and the hottes were removed surgically shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive vaginal plastics.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitals.
After he had learned the truth, he returned to male identity, received testosterone injections and removed his breasts.
The operation has made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexuals to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Legal Advocates for Informed Choice group based in California, is concerned that the German law can encourage “to stamp down and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign to the child a ‘not defined’,” she said.
We fear that this will favour intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know yet how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, because 'it allows adults to be recognized as third-sex'.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight at which small children should be forced at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law 'autonomous' both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the recipe efect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to receive a child by adoption or by a carcass.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to take over decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this way everything is all right – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parent happiness.
And you don't have to take an operation that can't be revoked.
"This involves the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents kill because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shooting from car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shot from a car.
The offenders probably fired a group of children with an air pressure weapon in Genthin on Thursday night.
This was reported by the police in Castle.
The girl was slightly wounded on the left wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The offenders also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they went away.
The police investigated, it was said on Friday.
By now, the police inspector Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called two times to throw eggs, which threw them against housecases.
Since the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the eggs immediately, no material damage was likely to have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were also burned in the city area, but there has not been any material damage here.
A resident on the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in with cloning paper and his scrolling blankets were avoided.
However, until the police arrived, the man found his radar blinds in immediate proximity, so the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives wonderfully.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree estate, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders," says Waltraud Ries and shows on a fat spinner on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinning phobia, but the concern to be unable to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment at age, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniskus operation, the mid-five-five-year-old has had to learn on her own, which means moving from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently, a book of her was published on the theme 'Happy living in the age - Which living form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not go at all at age', she begins to tell.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with mid-50, Waltraud giants think differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who are at all dealing with the theme 'Woningen at the age'.
Most of them push it as long as they can.
Old always become only the others', she says gorgeous.
Only when the suffering pressure is really high, you think about it.
'Then it can be too late', says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 housing models for a self-determined living at age.
'But what form of living you choose is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution is not available for age.
Even those who could afford to rest in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you can also unite in Dolce Vita', the author of the book gives consideration to volunteers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioner-WG.
At age, everyone has his ticks and Macken
'But for me, it would not be such a community', she says with an eyebrowsing.
Not like in a student-WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At age, you just need your retreat rooms', says Ries.
The fact that an elderly community can still work does not mean that the bookmaker wants to exclude.
But this must be different from that of the classic students-WG.
And sometimes you just want your peace,' she believes.
In this opinion, at least in the capital of the country, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as it goes,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital of the country.
Your service advises people about the topic 'Become Older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also buy incomforts and limitations, only in order to remain in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Foundation Product Test.
Today there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are dealing with the age-based conversion of their home or apartment first inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for the age-based conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one thing can be realized, and if it's just the toilet seat lift, the interior architect clears up.
But not always the existing apartment can be redesigned age-like and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud giants.
While a staircase lift could be installed inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs up to the apartment door would be a far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it's more unpleasant to her than to the spinner at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue the prosecution of Snowden under criminal law
The U.S. has not changed their attitude to former U.S. intelligence assistant Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of having passed unauthorized secret information.
Hence, he had to be subjected to criminal proceedings in the United States, said the speaker of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent remarks by Snowden would not change it either.
Previously, German Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in fluent statements it was a parliamentarian and not a German government member.
Secret Service Officer Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was clarified by the former NSA employee sought by the United States in a letter not addressed, published by Green politicians Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Federal Day and the Attorney General.
The text of the letter shall, after a translation which is distributed by Strubbles, be as follows:
To the Competents
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
As I was employed in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of my government's law, which caused me to act morally.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have considered the disclosures to a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These spying disclosures made many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefit for society from these findings is becoming increasingly clear, while at the same time the risks acquired have been clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat dissens as a treasury and seeks to criminalise and accusation political expression.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that with the support of the international community, the Government of the United States will adopt this disastrous attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, particularly in terms of the truth and authenticity of the reports, as appropriate and legally.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to maintain international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipality council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "appropriate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," says Maier.
In the budget, EUR 100 000 were allocated.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
It is right to the mayor that Winterlingen has passed responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, like heating, looking for the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Square concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
As director Bianca Willmann raises the tactile at 19.30, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, presented the music pieces.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician's hip.
Report: Obama campaign considered to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have in secret considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times presents a copy of the book that will soon appear and she reported on Thursday evening that the top advisers of the President would have conducted “abundant group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether Obama's hope for re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly describes the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strict secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and the former senior adviser of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite its "short personal relationship" before finally a decision was taken against such chess after the data showed that Clinton's candidate would not significantly improve Obama's opportunities.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible surveys at that time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "required care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train would pay for the election hours.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin explained at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was ‘conscious of the possible change’, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was ‘possible’ that Obama had known it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political surveys had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the investigation whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
What's going on with my email?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service as in the traditional mail?
In the design of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not pay attention to creating a stable basis for an audible exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds more to an open postcard than to a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
The e-mail program or Anna's browser sends the e-mail to the e-mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the track the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the road.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail has a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check if it is a disgraceful and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their next holiday trip, Google can present corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an e-mail is extremely low.
But theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The law enforcement authorities and the intelligence services also have legal possibilities to collect or take note of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal outsourcing actions.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
With an openPGP standard encryption an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that you can't even easily recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google only play a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail were last dropped, GMail from Google was able to make a clear statement.
Mother scratches and retires in the forest
When his older mother died, a man from Wolfsburg had a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to raise her pension and care allowance.
A 67-year-old wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigation by the police in the forest, in order to continue to collect pension and care funds.
First of all, he concealed the death of the 89-year-olds, then he spent more than one and a half years in the money.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, no medication was needed for the needy mother.
The investigators told the pensioner that his mother travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, there was no evidence of a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that lights in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice in the dark – with the help of Quallen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous leakage.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on chills and had been able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eating, which increases the pH in the protein and triggers the lighting.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and light – the more you leak, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice lights.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the turtle lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good for it.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says: 'I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.'
This is in itself impossible because of the lightbreaking caused by the ice crystals consisting of ice cream; but I guess we can find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quarl that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
After six games, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League.
Exactly now, the team of Ingo Ehlers will come tomorrow to the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently wounded Hendrik Blohme, he has finally available his complete frame.
Also, Daverden, as we do, is on the pace game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
However, it is essential to increase the coverage, which last left everything but a safe impression.
After the first seasonal victory against Nordhorn, Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz will be more relaxed.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because everything can always happen in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to go back to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this purpose, the A-Jugendliche Joost Windßuß, who is active with double-playing rights at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffel.
In the last two years I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment with sweets, and I guess I will not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of US $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will represent about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting unleavened objects are the last scream.
Women no longer need to wear sexy clothes, they can now also embodie seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-Weltraummen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of 'hot dogs'.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not simplicious.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate beads, chips, bonbons and rubber beards.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Ministry of Trade, who move through the quarters with the word 'sweet or acid'.
In fact, we'll buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't make any sense – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sugar Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it sprinkles.
They have great names such as 'terror behind the walls' (which, by the way, is in a real prison), 'Howl-O-scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spy houses in the United States that earn 500 million dollars of revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are just pinking in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you are not getting rid of them, and then the guy on whom you stand leave a comment like 'net face expression'.
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Kürbis when we were kids, and cutting a Kürbislaterne is like the tasting of the Christmas tree – something we made up of small.
Fortunately, the 'baby in pumpkin' trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year Americans will spend around 106 million dollars for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin laterne, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to point right, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut some nice from their 921 kilo heavy pumpkin.
Flat fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains cooled body
The firefighter had to break out in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescue forces are putting a coaled body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmbrechts, rescue forces found a carved body in a three-family house.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighter arrived, the flames already struck out of a window.
The crew went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to advertise for the profession of the Pastor.
Background is a possible lack of priests: The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects," said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the day itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned a pastor in a full place to enthusiastic young people for theology study.
At present, less and less young people choose to study theology after academia.
Burfien leads this back to the process of decirculation: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud."
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my calendar and can put my emphasis there where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to human beings.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well from them.
Certainly more paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not just about career, but about sinful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors retired a year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vikariat.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as resin, Emsland or Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien wants, among other things, to organize days of study for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a freephone system.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with the support of Bowler Works Mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventures as well as for an accessible way to world class events.
We are looking forward to opening this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare new people for the Strapazen and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Ways – this will be a entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February, as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called for the rescue of a dog 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock jump in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in a stone break in her nauseous situation
Firefighters seized themselves on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firefighter succeeded in bringing a dog to safety that was fixed in a rock wall on a 15-metre high.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby had run away after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the stone break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and published help calls in social networks when she escaped the stone break after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high slope in the stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried and turned to rescue Rubys, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a rather unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge luck."
It was possible that she was very severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination, but he did not find anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to watch rescue."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jaggers' song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker at night, and that "he sucked me when I was 18."
She added: "It's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: 'Maybe she confused him with someone else'.
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on top of 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scotlands the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a border secured with stitch wire along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde model highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what is really wanted by the Scottish people.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has come in such a way that it is already like a fossil: the first time I heard the 'independence means passport checks'-Entes at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in constantly repeating this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why do the London yoke exchange against the Brussels yoke, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for Europe's unification after the war has come to an end.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties will win on land that are EU-fighting or want to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to have an alternative for Germany – founded only this year – for almost five million votes at the Federal Day election in September, thereby effectively dismissing the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket to which the national economy is required by holding the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budgetary deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to let them do so.
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency, South Europe will find itself with an integrated productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – inspired by Berlin.
A deeper European productivity problem lies behind the current budgetary and monetary problems.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much as the United States for electricity and four times as for gas.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's pay marks do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American squirrel gas.
As a result, a revolt rises, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be held in chess and Paris lifted up with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, which has to do with the attacked French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-handed EU enemy Front National has just won a decisive post-election and thus referred the ruling socialists to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that splitting in the right spectrum would automatically give advantages to the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge a anti-EU anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut out well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go: in the future, not too much further, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the (suveräne) nations' favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to be distant from this project in the hope of getting into the USA.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland with all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could drive well in a more relaxed European association if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against the savings policy in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) reductions that Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to be responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now on independence, only in order to have Berlin and Brussels forced a policy of saving.
Early puberty: faster growing up
Afro-American and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age mates, as research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and shame hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the Children's Association of American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – normally this is not a sign of a rapid puberty,” explained Kaplowitz.
Clear signs of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair, as well as body odour, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch (prevalence of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years until menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Previous Puberty of Girls: The essential adviser to deal with this frequently occurring problem".
Time is the exactest test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is ‘good’ when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth stimulus before eight years of age.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a paediatric doctor can closely monitor.
Tests by an endicronologist may be indicated in a faster advance, so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defence of another consequence: the premature ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant in terms of medicines, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their old-age mates."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter had her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her friend circle.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are cause.
Boys come in puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged 6 to 9 who create a link between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, Afro-American and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age mates.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys are growing in the past, the trend towards a complete earlier puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shame hair is even widespread in babies and infants.
"We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their paediatrics how to speak to their child.
"This can mean that you need to have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute in front of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class during long-range flights, indicating the sound for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who strive most for airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest airplanes of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
This week Airbus called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range airplanes, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new "Mini-Jumbo" design will deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" makes 406 people in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transport 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share hiebe about technical details through advertising in the professional press.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an announcement that might be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, and the title: "Do you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats which are closer than regional Turbo-Props," says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
Given changes in dietary habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between the 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival has a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out which showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus' numbers to the seat sizes and says that it is not in the hands of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between air tariffs and facilities.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It is really about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they feel to be successful," explains Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly a topic that may have an impact on transactions.
A race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least USD 700 billion by listing prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements on the results depend partly on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore runs more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose the tighter arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper flight tariffs.
"At eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat," says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin facilities, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world traveling jet sellers even carry band measurements to measure the establishment in competition.
Even if they price comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compact design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not sold any according to its own statement yet.
Until recently Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats at the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably be punctuated, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garrison
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine infection for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before human tests, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying to test all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine infectiousness is stronger than these approaches,” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant current of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so that a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccined mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
However, mice without vaccination would have taken a 'outtime', the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given to maintain the antibody level so often that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to humans if it was safe to give children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine infection.
But more likely, smokers would use it to stop.
"Then they know: when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to stop their habits," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denied to have been influenced by Obeid
An investigation is initiated by the state corruption supervisor against the former minister of the Lab Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales.
The former NSW minister denies that he had changed the lease arrangements at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three lands in a state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of State to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a call for notice after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation that Tripodi had known the hidden interest of Obeids in the lands after Tripodis' former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had declared it appropriate on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had insisted on public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which introduced the Obeids 2.5 million dollars a year, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had initially voted for public tenders.
However, he refused to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reform of the government's lease arrangements.
One of ICAC's phone records showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Where was the issue discussed in these telephone calls the development of commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli combat aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night, confirmed a leading government collaborator to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile delivery in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The Government is considering an 'authenticity test' for foreign workers with 457 visas in the framework of extended measures.
If the test was introduced, it would use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former member of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insulted by Australia's neighbours.
“Loud explanations like , foreigners are supposed to work behind , and ,Australians first , are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the region melted an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once envisaged by the former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who held discussions yesterday on trafficking in human beings in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended amendments, others still being considered.
If the 'authenticity criterion' is accepted, a person applying for a visa may be checked as to whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or to a relevant person of the assisting undertaking'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 holders of visas after, in the past, hundreds of companies who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have ended up.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri-lank asylumian probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disrupted nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The UK Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England from the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring Britain closer together'.
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed road between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in discussions with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further routes capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of traveling from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are going ahead with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for "unambiguous" to engage in the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: 'The high-speed railway connection is the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast railway connections throughout the UK.'
Therefore, we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed railway connection in Scotland, creating benefits for all and supplementing the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, see or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "fly mode".
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies observe the decision on the implementation of which US airlines are required to do a lot of work, but do not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA also stated that the announcement would be reviewed, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia were still valid.
'Casa currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft', has been announced.
The subject is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA on the extension of its Wi-Fi maintenance system to flights and explained that you are open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas explained that the current regulations will remain in place until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when launching and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change this," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons for that.
The decision is different in US companies depending on the fleet's age.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After a carrier has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any level," the FAA announced.
In rare cases in poor sight, the crew will advise passengers to turn off the devices while landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices should be stowed safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the districtderby against Schalke, with the BVB trailers with luminous rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already psychic acoustics that offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesligaspiel between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
The guest fans were most to hear with their songs.
The southern tribe, on the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stood, first presented themselves exceptionally quietly: No songs, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the tribune, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Prohibition".
Only as gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, burned short-term joy.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and hurting scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribe, nothing was raining.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over arsenal, extension of the contract of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebrity.
Only five minutes before the grip, the Capo climbed his podest - and the touchable tension until then fell out in a loud scream when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the edges of the stadium.
The last was the south tribe, as always, on the line - and finally again was the most loudest place in the stadium as usual.
And at the latest when the loud invitation "Derby winner stands up" came with the tip of the southern tribe, everything was again like usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the spectator's tracks and on the square - and almost hit the gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather unpleasant date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday evening on a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure Watzke forbids the ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I banned that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke says, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This will be cutting," Watzke assured.
You can be thrilled how the reactions to the southern tribe then come out.
Farmhouses boom in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armband, a ring and a pair of earrings in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and also works her husband, the monthly family income is not rich, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of South East Asia – where the debt of the households is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, was the third pand house listed on the Singaporen stock exchange this week.
It is not only a faster way to get money – 1 300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as a bank loan.
Typically, deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, there is an advantage that there is no need for a review of the creditworthiness or income certificates, so loans are faster than possible for banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pans after families feel pressure by increasing living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a lesser fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium income seek to compensate for the difference in a sturdy economy.
This week, the Rating Agency called Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, an increase of 60 per cent still in 2008.
Economics are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has almost come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued export weaknesses and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end effect, this means that, in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices in the last two years have further strengthened the trend towards the housing of personal objects, as people use the opportunity to convert the jewellery of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the landfilled items are in the 200 deposit houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai trustee, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders had fallen into the cross fire because of high interest rates, Yes explains that banks not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but did not directly increase their debt.
'Clients borrow items that they already own and the liquidation of personal value items does not increase household education,' she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted in society as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people using mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social shift come to us.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies who have to bridge shortcomings in cash flow," says Yes.
Sometimes they just need very fast money.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Edward Snowden, a secret service officer, has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly brittle NSA business.
According to the presentation by the Green-Bundestag Member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia focused on the conditions under which former secret service employees would testify at a German prosecutor or before an investigation committee.
Snowden had referred to his complex legal situation, Strrübele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with the US$ 325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money.
The Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take 'unanimity measures' to address a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consulting with the independent Tasmanian representative Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has set up an emergency rescue package which, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package comprises 31 million dollars of emergency assistance for election services.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for gray star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, specialist training, services in the area of mental health and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that I have been told by the clinic workers concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Government of Tasmania.
The federal government must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-person Commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would not be useful if 'they were not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the public health system to a more sustainable course'.
Notwithstanding that, he praised the Government for having responded to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state's public health system from the concern list," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these election services will largely compete with the recent cuts.
However, the opposition's health policy speaker at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today's announcement is only a 'flaster solution'.
"We are in today's situation because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government cuts almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth into 300 million and then pretends the good news.
Dutton called for Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more expensive than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the striking story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips away in luxuriousness or sensational desire – and there is its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a tortured shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, as a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and Gitft gas ammunition, said the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while there were serious collisions in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances were suspected to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which the Hague organization Damascus had set up to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to make them 'inoperable', including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to begin with destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
It is assumed that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when battles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say that there is here a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in the UK.
The group of activists, who persecuted the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria, declared that on Thursday 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad that 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2.202 desertified army soldiers and 5.375 opponents of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have links with al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights underline the threat posed to chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous weapons arsenal is a race against the time of a blazing civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced their destruction."
Therefore, 'no further inspection activities are currently planned'.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus.
The inspectors said that, because of safety concerns, the visit of two institutions would not have been possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two locations had been "released" according to the Syrian statement and that the objects of the chemical weapons programme there were transferred to other designated bodies that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
"I am taking care of the courage and courage you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have fought against the government of Assad and their security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawites, a division of Shiitian Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger about judgment for bombers of Bali
Surviving and relatives of the 202 people who had died during the bombing in Bali in 2002 were annoyed by the judgement for the last of the sponsors who were brought to court, since Umar Patek was supposed to be shot by law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in South East Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year imprisonment for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
An indictment was also made in a number of terrorist-related accusations, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on the Holy Night in 2000.
The Public Prosecutor had demanded a lifelong imprisonment, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also called the "Demolition Man" due to his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has brought painful memories to June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day with that I won't have another grandchildren and I won't see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equated to the ground floor when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23:00 a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicidal killer exploded an explosive-filled backpack.
He fell into the coma three times for a month after the attack, while hanging on a life-saving system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbad and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should have the death penalty before all the others.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali Bomber who was in court.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. military forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has not shown regret for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The judgement took place before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which was held with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not hold phone calls)
From departure to landing, air travellers can now hear their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and use the view of movies, but can not phone with the phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As quickly as they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA collaborator Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight personnel and the arrangements for the installation of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start again until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing aeroplane, passengers must turn them off again and do not start again before the plane landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when launching, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft re-equipped for the use of Wi-Fi at larger altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional association of professional crew crew members, welcomed the changes.
"If the new scheme is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit," Glading commented.
We are honestly sorry to feel like guardians on this subject.
However, Internet connections for surfing, e-mail exchanges, text messages or downloads of data remained prohibited under three kilometres, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game played by the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the airline.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be dumped, as there is a risk of injury in this case if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift bans on certain electronic devices when launching and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security expert on national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones were still considered to be a risk.
"Phone is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitters," Rosenker said.
A sector advisory committee, set up by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Criticists like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become universal.
In some studies, it is said that up to one third of the passengers forget or ignore the switch-off of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of interference of navigation and communication devices by UKW radios carried by passengers, which then constituted the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not matter electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a few years when the altitude is reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment according to the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally produce much less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-readers only give minimum radiation when re-leasing.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the defenders of a relaxation of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, company employees lodged a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but no one could find.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the opinion that the disruption caused by the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there are only individual reports of pilots who speak for a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
The Committee, however, recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the disconnection of the devices by passengers in the event of instrument landing under poor visual conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would now be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Reliberated by air rescue service of the North Sea drill island rescued bird
A bird flew by air rescue service on the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water roller was flew last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was picked up by the Scottish Animal Welfare Organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rail was probably a winter bird from Northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: 'He was unable to continue flying, so we were contacted with the request for help.'
When it was released, the water rim was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK who provide prosperity and work want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, representing around the British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They wish that the government promotes new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of stopping the long and energetic process of reforming the overriding EU institutions.
Asked in their view on certain legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be restored to Westminster.
There was general discontent about the internal market, as, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now be greater than the benefits of being part of the European trade zone – even 40% of the large companies agreed to the most European-friendly ones.
Finally, and that is probably the most saying, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a path towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing for a ' sensual change' that brings the booklet of action back to the UK.
There is much to do – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the EU stay in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for re-negotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, since the euro area is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means that businesses are more focused on trade and that the Brussels regulatory approach is fundamentally changed.
Alexei Miller by Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects,” said the Gazprom Board.
"The present event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk in conventional routes, as is to be heard from the official side.
Mr Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project starts in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no way passes the property location of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th day of the stock exchange paper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country in a European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa by Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out on the 9th day of the stock exchange paper.
According to Ulbrich, the view on the volume of transactions shows how German commercial property is sought.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6% and in France 19%.
"Immobile investments offer an attractive interest rate," Ulbrich said.
The return distance between real estate and federal bonds is historically high.
The FAA facilitates restrictions on the use of electronic devices in aircraft – even if telephone calls with the phone remain prohibited.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual offences related to children before charges against the childcareer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that 'the organisation had never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse'.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of the abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's lawyers, that he knew of the first case, but that he did not know the second case.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission had also been incorrect in the claim that 'there were external inspections by the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety'.
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed 'from me downward' in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been sentenced to the YMCA for sexual abuse of twelve boys during his two-year activity at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, contested that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord's breaches regarding the safety of children.
Employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, she was privately cared for as a babysitter, let her sit on his foot, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chief lord was and who had asked for training on child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the senior lords in the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very inaccessible”.
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have been able to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, had rather affected her friendship with Lord her judgment, which is why they did not report to him.
Hare stated that he had informed the Executive Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the "Jonathan Lord's Transition" did not concern "not reporting" by employees, and the Executive Board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to press employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations occurred had been taken by YMCA's CEO, Liam Whitley.
He said that this would prevent contamination of the evidence, but what had been 'exaggerated' and misimplemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there were "stricky problems" in the recruitment, verification, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the opportunity to return as a British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his withdrawal from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy topics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador of the Middle East Peace founders' Quartet.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the Horseschau experts arrived in Cardiff in Scareds to cure the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was coming.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, who isn't even in the kindergarten and did his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee hit loosely through the three rounds and took the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both as large, was praised for its appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a frequent angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which lie far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with Shetland-Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great tension."
They had to go against the entire field of participants and left the place with goldpokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The young boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been presenting horses for over ten years.
Howells told: "The whole audience was like electricized and everyone fired it and knocked it."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he has started, it won't take long until he's on the "Pferd of the Year" shade – and I'm sure he'll cut out well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jurys evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they would have beaten and presented themselves in the performance ring.
They look after good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed to their part, which really fits perfectly for the occasion.
The Chinese newspaper is to be reformed after the call
A Chinese newspaper, who had called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery money to counterfeit reports about a state company.
The new express is now being subjected to a 'completing correction', the regulatory authority said.
The 'rectification order' was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, a member of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to 'enforce an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's licence.
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been advised to complete the correction of the New Express and recommended that the relevant accountants be identified at the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on the state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the State news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I did the wrong thing.
After Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and explained that they failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still being forced routinely, despite a change in law in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned from compeling someone to accuse themselves.
Discovered drug tunnels with own rail between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120-time 90-inch tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless unseen warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug loaded trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before unrecognized drugs could be transported in it, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentences between 10 years and lifetime in the case of a guilt.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network of dewashing channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 meters long passage with rails, which went from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "sometimes life doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope it".
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and her son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism is, according to Lexika, subject to vegetarianism, but differs considerably from that.
For while vegetarians allow the consumption of sawnets, ice or a strong Edamian, these slurries are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the abandonment of meat and fish, the Vegans abandon all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains may be wondered, but in a closer perspective, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable wealth of invention.
"Brothprints are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for Veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander lives vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian."
By the turn of the century then took the next step and I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers normal leather.
He recognized that it was also in other everyday matters without animal products.
First of all, vegan being an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the Vegans, which extends to the whole consumption behaviour.
Instead of chasing Burgers, Eggs or Rubbers, the Veganer quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually vegan does not represent a renouncement, no ascesis, but it's an enrichment." Assuming that with the diet conversion you reduce the selection of food options, Proctor is more likely to return to the power of habit.
And just these conditions made some still so well - meant attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor compares.
And use: "Definite tastes are not to be fixed on the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," the Vegans explain.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue party.
It takes care of a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste well once.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
"It should taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
He did not suffer health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I don't take any other cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are best, I often check," Proctor tells.
In particular, many Veganism critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are fed with feed instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the proportion of vitamin B12 is high in the meat purchased in the cooling box," says Proctor.
Veganer also has the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are all right," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food supply.
Finally, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soybean milk and other products.
Everything I need can be found on the spot.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
"Many people ignore that only the finished products are expensive, but that is what is known for "normal" finished products."
Nonetheless, the preparation of vegan dishes is far more favourable and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knives you can achieve good if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cakes, Proctor could also make his grandparents astonish.
Family festivals give the Veganer a new sausage.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new importance.
"The situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
But, of course, he has already been sceptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - In such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to be enslaved.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as it is thought - and the vegans do not seem as restricted in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are pommes everywhere!
"Many döner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he departs on pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slowly engaging in it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people to make them aware of it."
"When enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the combous in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes other restaurants to have at least a vegan dishes on the menu.
In fact, vegan dishes are available for all.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Fishing dishes are exclusive, however, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand that also in nuts animal additives can contain it as a colourer, you seem to quickly leave the courage with compliance with ethics with so many obstacles and traps.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning products.
"A scanner view is developed gradually and you know what characters and logos you have to look after "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stay standing or stumble," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingertip that strikes consciousness.
He may not be able to put away his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
Trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour for errors in data transport.
In August this year there had been two pans alone in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively defective purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
The stock exchange operators then took almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the United States came out for several hours because of a computer pane on the Nasdaq exchange.
Facebook's stock exchange was also taking place last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC established and awarded the company a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Radler runs around 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 26-year-old man travelled on Thursday evening, at 22:00 a.m., with a lady bike on the left walkway from the station square towards the marketplace.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man entered the walkway from a place, the cyclist, according to the police, could no longer brake in time.
At the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and attracted a 15-inch place wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police grants Assange a declaration of extradition
Today, the British police handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a 'requirement to stand up' calling for him to appear in a police station, and added, if he did not comply with it, threatened him to be arrested.
Assange threatens the extradition to Sweden for the prosecution in a sexual offence, after its possibilities have been exhausted by British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its opposition to the extradition in the beginning of the month.
Since he feared that Stockholm would deliver it to the United States, he had sought refuge in the ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said that 'a 40-year-old man had been invited to attend a police station at a time that we chose,' said a speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the submission of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spy charges after he published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks' revelation website.
Driver who was stuck between the legs with 210 km/h and hot drink receives a penalty of 1,000 £
A driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester Court of Justice, Howie confessed guilty without having driven the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of payment of costs of £90 as well as a victim supplement of £100.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% in the 2012 budget on apartments costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, revenues from the stamp tax for housing in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in fiscal year 2012/13 amounted to 708 million pounds, totaled revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, the northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-cost dwellings and the introduction of the related legislation against a circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant in terms of buying real estate in London, or stop selling owners," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market after price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased by the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging 'inland market' where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a upward trend, according to a survey by Savills.
Scientists were able to give more light on the context in which a dog’s cockspoiling is in his mood.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs with the cock turned more to the right (from the view of the dog), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimulations that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right-hand brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheries played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side swings of their fellow species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behaviour.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock moves into one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and thus we could control the movement of the cock more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how a otherwise unprinted dog moved the cock to the right (seeed from the perspective of the twisting dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when the tail inclination was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog who weighs), her heart rate rose and they looked unrest.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and wedding with the cock is more linked to friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behaviour, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol, stated that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, it was said: “Hunds go to a robot dog when his ‘tail’ turns left and not right, instead of being disturbed – exactly different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halfs are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been ill of throat ignition.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in Hydro on Friday.

The band's announcement came after she had to postpone an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a throat inflammation, which is why he cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now held on November 20, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.

Pope Francis appointed first Cardinals in February
On February 22, Pope Francis was appointed for the first time as new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will finally participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Pope election – this is the case for a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that there will be a meeting of all Cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new Cardinals, which is also known as the Consistory.
"Pass Franziskus has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Constituency in February, so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals who are elected will be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistorium next year is therefore important because it was the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, says Valero.
There are currently some overhangs on the sides of Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of Cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinals Council established by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world, who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Franziskus has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He stated that it was 'very possible' that Franziskus asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far, we were not in this position – this is all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called Cardinals, but Franziskus is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints”.
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the United States to repair the seat lining
General Motors called back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat lens, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulatory authority on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for the reposition of the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines on Vehicle Safety in Head Supports.
"When driving from behind to the vehicle, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the message was read on the NHTSA website.
The retrieved models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the 2009 insolvency restructuring.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government Shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20% in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Screams of a Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made praiseful efforts that have been ruined by the blockade tactics of the Republicans
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm currently reading a terriblely sad book.
It's a book that I thought it would raise me up during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (but to win) and paints the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and could rob a speech.
The election became an earthquake victory and spokesperson held in order to highlight the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates were crying for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% of his consent.
And then I'll close the book.
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening as if one was cut out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that political blockadetactics have stipped too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to mention only some.
But after many times defending the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I ended with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why you allow the listening of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in the overseas world.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is being punished to disclose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trials, nor why the public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House's efforts to rest the media are 'the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government'.
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Parliamentary Office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massaker characterize the public debate.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to have been largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidateship.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unfinished alternative, he seemed to be unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of so long.
However, with the drop in acceptance values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees to come back to course and follow the purpose of their business.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree much.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those expressed by Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott had conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer said Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters would become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The Mining Magnat, which is in a court dispute about the payment of $6 million of CO2 tax, raised the claim that he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes will be abolished or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer election committee officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Costest session of Fairfax with 53 votes.
Palmer called for a revision of the voice counting process so that it could proceed faster.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you enter the data into a computer, immediately select it and then at 6:30 in the evening have the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of lead pencils when marking the polling tab.
Do you use it because you can wipe out the results if you don't like them?
To vote with pencils today is unbelievable.
The Election Commission has examined the options for electronic elections and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is concerned with the service to the public.
"We are not seeking reward except for history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation of the alleged manipulations in the currency market is taking a fast start.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were working with the authorities in investigations in the world's largest financial market, changing the owners $5.3 billion daily.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation to draw the scandal around the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, related persons indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPM organ.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was released this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The immediate message group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said about the situation.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority declared Finma that she was investigating a alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks pass instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has put the dealers in a riot in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies reduces the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the deal and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and high-quality liquid currency market, but leading dealers are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks would lead to “it is possible to influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had terminated a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds Office this week after he caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is closed," Credit Suisse explained.
Painted the Bauzaun on the Bechtle basepiece
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has decorated the Bauzaun on the Bechtle base at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the path, says a press release.
The planned cover of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site threatens to decay.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparency with the message "We have been for it" had been placed.
However, this did not make any difference to the about 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was called "We are against construction ruins".
So she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day.
In a conversation with many passers before the "Bauplace" it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will be much better, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city delays these answers further, it says from the BI.
As was heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an impact.
At the municipal council meeting, May had said that he feared the outage for the thermal bath, the people should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadows when deciding citizens.
Some seem just scared because others feel that they are a "plumpy extortion attempt" in the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick beads for Schiris: Mane no swan king
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick is with the current high-form of the Federal League table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed the sports director of the "Bulls" by the arbitrators.
"There is currently a dangerous trend that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönigen," he protected the two offensives on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
Latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grodig last Sunday, where Senegalese became a supposed actress - which was obviously no one, as the TV images showed.
"A disappointment," said Rangnick, who referred to arbitrator Harkam as "massly overdue".
Harkam would also have contributed to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grodig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German landman decided: "I would have acted the same in every individual situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself doesn't want to have contact with his colleague after the hatch.
I don't know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," stressed the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success race, Rangnick agreed to a lobbieshymne.
"There are only two words for that: quite good," he said.
There's not much to be put on.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
That's what I'm supposed to do.
There will be hardly any change in the framework in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"In addition to a player's wish to leave the club," Rangnick made it clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The US Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it obliges US citizens to complete health insurance or to pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional in the framework of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also considered that the provision of the health law that states should either extend the conditions of access to medicines or would otherwise be abolished by all state medicines would not be contrary to the Constitution.
The proceedings against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decidedly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low sunset, the smoken in the Vestfjord valley usually falls from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters height, a century dream was realized on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in TV2.
Some inhabitants corrected sun chairs, while others put sunglasses on safety.
So far, in winter, sunhungers had to drive with a rope track to a close peak.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After a multi-annual debate, the City Council had finally approved the expensive 5 million kronor project (about 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian alpine town of Viganella for several years.
Post hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sundays are still on various mailboxes in the core city and the districts, but if you read the small prints on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP informs.
A question from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays only before the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptyed.
Whether it is still empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's question.
The social and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up here.
Sunday rental is an important post service just at the time post.
"This company, despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, dilutes it radically and unpleasantly."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and Urban Association, supports his fellow Members: "What is annoying me is the fact that in this area, in secret, the time of emptying is changed or deleted."
The post is a mile away from the citizen.
"At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be empty again on Sunday," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sundays.
Röhrenbeck asked in the City Parliament whether the city administration was planning to talk with the mail about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, his knowledge also provides a Sunday loan in Hofheim.
Your party has voted in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The City's Magistrate will advise this morning on a presentation by Transport Desk Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, the parking charges should be increased by 50 percent.
However, the price should not be increased, but the time interval of parking clocks and parking card machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Ordinance Assembly will have to decide.
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this "no good idea".
The possibility of parking directly before the business is "a non-underestimable advantage for smaller traders".
The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "very reasonable and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions overrumble hosts
With a narrow frame, the men of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to come against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbian Alb.
Although the elders were on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it turned out that they were not able, even old-fashioned, to hold up with the rapid actions of the joy cities.
The Gönninger became extremely difficult with the hard and placed lifts.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not on the spot in the block defence.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and game-determining performance, the third sentence was then won a little lazy and unpleasant to 3:0-end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent in the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to pass clearly in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were confronted.
They delivered a hardly fought two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and points gifts especially when taking the ball; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes deficient and in some critical play scenes the overeifer prevented the view of possible points gains.
In this highly balanced meeting, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team voted for the great physical use and enjoyable commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
For the fifth day of care, following the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cut free," said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Emperor, described this area as the shrine of the gorgeous staircase, where the landscape offers the ideal framework for wonderful views.
He thanked the attendants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate tool to strengthen the connection between human and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourism aspect, environmental consideration could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting of Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the rule and wished the action a good success.
The tourist goal of the wide view is, according to Tribukait, covered by the aim of maintaining the now highly growing old allmendwidveld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and lawns, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free links to artery maintenance.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lans for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current action is not merely seamlessly included in this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the previous day of care for the future.
After these various presentations, head Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff included the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in the foreground, and the slider could be ready to retrieve.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of guardian bushes and the care of a dry stone rod.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Löffingen: Cupper still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Bar Town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, child, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own city works can be called an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet reported.
The 46-year-old bank buyer and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen is the only candidate for the success of Mayor Norbert Brugger who is no longer a candidate for age.
The application period expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei charged for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday enforced a lawn of claims for patent infringements against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overloaded by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for 4.5 billion US dollars, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies of patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents concern technology that brings search terms in the Internet into line with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After the Nortel patents were overloaded by Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library to obtain patents.
"While Google has failed to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the letter of appeal.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt obeys first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi is resigning the office, but his day of the triumph is not likely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a 'new Egypt' when he was promised as the first freely elected president of the country, and thus the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath in front of the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, who had their seat on the Nile and had imitated an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who since its establishment 84 years ago had been most frequently taken into the vision of the respective government as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11:00.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential punch from the Mubarak time, the traffic was stopped only in a short time so that the car convoy could cross the usual driven road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypters are today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said the Mursi dressed in a blue suit with red cravate to the judges in the wooden boarded chamber, in which he laid the official side.
Later Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel who played the national hymn that he listened to.
The military leader field march Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendees in the University's largest hearing room with speech choirs of 'The army and the people are a hand'.
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a high-bourg of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday on the Tahir place, the birthplace of the rebellion, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and he promised to revoke the presidial powers which the Military Council had taken over by the Head of State chased out of office.
But with the formal oath to the court and not as usual to the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech on the Tahir place was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it will continue with a 25-Occupation party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed from head: severely injured
When changing a defective external feeler, a 51-year-old worker crashed in Eggelsberg by a head and hurt himself seriously.
The man from the right-hand house wanted to change a defective heater at the outside facade of a guest house.
When he climbed to the ladder on the roof curtain, the ladder slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg State Hospital.
raper in South Africa: two lifetime detentions
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two lifetimes on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim had later died of the consequences of serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had triggered national shocks.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours, the doctors fought for the victim's survival, but in vain.
The eyes of the young people were so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
During the process Kana had admitted to have been in a bar with Booysen in the night of the act.
He also confessed to have beaten and raped her, but he disputed to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially left several offenders, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient.
During the proceedings, the Attorney General also stressed that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa rapes are almost all day: there are about 64,000 reports on sexual violence every year.
These are almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women's associations in South Africa value the dark figure for sexual violence at 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the television broadcast "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pork bulbs, turbomast is not a good condition.
Can chins that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"German's favorite ham," as Jumbo announces the black forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can use the microphone.
Jumbo viewed for reinforcement at fast snack in Waldshut
"Here I'll be working in large quantities," the TV makers, black forests chins as a mass product.
16,000 columns a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters with quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
TV with a level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph value.
"I'm thrilled when you test Roberto Blanco what happens then," said Jumbo cynicically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's worth watching.
The viewer sees that cutting the pillars continues to be handwork.
Because: Black forests ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoking fire are an optical reminder of a U-boat.
The trick: tanning branches here in smoke provide the special taste of the black forest ham.
Twenty days in smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will enable all interested parties to live.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre won eight percent in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
'Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are in good direction towards record year revenues before interest and taxes,' he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia, the recreational sector recovered in the second half of the year, which compensated for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while here the business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third consecutive year for the whole year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, writing and grammar
In courses of English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination will also include "unseen texts" to encourage more broad reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students have to carry out an independent GCSE language test, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core areas will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, announces a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less course work.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a 'wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence', stressing that the GCSEs would become 'testing, ambitious and stricter'.
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent in mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week a year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive mathematical examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Attractive beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and color beats present the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
Evaluations have already been made on Thursday
The local association W514 will once again present this great exhibition.
The breeders of the clubs in the Soest district show their best animals as well as young hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six award judges made the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m. Mayor Hermann Arndt.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors from 10 a.m. on Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m. on Sunday, to which the winners will join.
Guests are also invited to a Tombola and a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecomenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecomenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, the New Museum of the Castle is about the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological reflections on today's dealing with the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The ecumenical discussion forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Communities Salem, the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Bodenseekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the question of how people now classify the "last things" after death.
If the people of the past centuries had known too much about it and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "which characterize our ideas until now", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes for completion is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She has provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the call marks.
Johanna Rahner continues, "But the crucial challenge remains the anxiety of death".
This involves the question of that desire, "who dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She obtained a PhD degree in 1997 to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecomenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been a lecturer for systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Prisoners: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their confession of faith
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Seal Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been established.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the service, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and invoked the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous community members, the company had prepared for the big holiday.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the day of youth in underpoweral.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
During wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to handle the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This informs Ulrich Knobel of the organisering sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 metres of altitude, were also numerous Eachmansradlers who once wanted to practice their hobby in the competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz received good placements with the recommendation at the German Championships.
Both of them were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time forward to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
On second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it up to the winner's staircase.
In place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race, even more absolute topathlets were at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to withdraw from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain biking semi-profi from the Black-Tusk-racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate were two times world champions on 12-hour cars.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls his own two German championship titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 metres of height, a whirlwind final was reached in the front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl was the first to race over the target line.
Only one second behind that, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall valuation.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as the third of the overall valuation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers showed themselves very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through sludge, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw his sick father constantly lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that extended to his brain and caused there a haematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and is not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the proportion in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditure are private.
'The only problem they have is poverty,' says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, who travels weekends in rural areas and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced to get in small buses and drive onto the villages that need help with the fastened medical equipment on the roof over unmounted terrain.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and sludge.
But when they arrive, they will be received like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its wide smile and its unlimited energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning the team then starts testing hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per ride," said Bwelle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometres around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crows, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply can't afford.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations with local nausea.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the intervention the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the group generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a busy pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then returns to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of cameran doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a blast break that he had received now allows him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," he said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest is from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteers in Bwelles Group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to collect practical experiences that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we can help digest blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated health material.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Kamerun people do not know any limits.
For Bwelle, almost permanent work is not a burden.
To help others make a happier life and thus fulfill a promise that he has given to his Father, he makes great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Excellent master of the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut to the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, the art of play.
No one can pretend to the old man Santiago when fishing.
That's how they're just a great complement.
It's almost meant to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of life bending on the chair, that is true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who doesn't give up and finally wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his strength of will.
Janson is on the stage in many distances as a single performer.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so his monologists are not boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat act in front of the fishing village.
During the performance he puts the active scene in light: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, which with her songs and her glorious voice sings the sense of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewage channel from the Roman era has been obtained under Cologne at about 120 metres.
If you visit Cologne, you don't come by the Dome.
Around 157 metres, the two towers shove into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrane churches know that there is a lot to discover also under the Dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's subworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the service centre of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Dome.
The tour begins unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-right city, and therefore the rest of the old city walls remained only that which was not too big.
Most of the users of the parking lot are also passing by the Roman remains today and only drop off their car.
But whoever looks more closely in Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological discovery separated by metal grid bars.
It can be seen about five meters high ruins of hand plate sized stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the well of the old Dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next station of the tour is the Pretorium, and here the participants go back to the depth.
Here we experience the seat of the formerly powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman Law and City of Agrippinens, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the pretorium is the former Statthalter Palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage channel, which is preserved here at about 120 meters length.
"You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze mutters the guests.
A surprise still has Schulze.
After picking up the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washings.
Until now, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different levels of water can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction works should begin soon.
However, until completion, a few years will remain.
Fast cut off leg: new edition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be rerolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous body injury and material damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The defendants are silent to the beginning.
They were supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and had been among the bandidos then.
In June 2009, the Attorney-General referred them to stick and beat three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely wounded, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have been part of Hells Angels' competitive group.
One would have been a high-level member from Berlin.
There was apparently a persecution hunt with several cars.
According to the charges, it was about district fights and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been released in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
At that time, a court spokesman said that it was not possible to prove that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feast.
The offenders had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof repealed the judgment after revision of the Attorney General and referred it back to the Landgericht for further proceedings.
One of the accused is currently in open execution for another delict.
The opening was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night of the act.
As a witness, the detective was invited.
In the centre were phone calls of the accused and other persons who had listened to the police.
It's hard to say that Rocker is almost always following a law for her - and not to testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had been packed out.
Attorney Stefan Golfier from the Frankfurt (or) Attorney General said, on demand, that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
A further eleven days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The discard society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but sometime it's going home.
Only: In the trees of the people on the passenger and back seats the hunger becomes noticeable.
Sure, it may be the responsibility of some cocktail or sect!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to get a little bit?
I admit, I'd like to be with you when it's late night or early in the morning to go to Fastfood Holen.
A few pommes, a cola, a burger, and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangs are noticeable.
For what does one need to miss that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with steady regularity?!
Especially on weekends, wasted paper bags are located on roadsides and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home or the next garbage?
It's not just that the paperwork is spreading the landscape.
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as control boards and caused accidents.
But about something like that said "wrecking society" not after, probably she doesn't even know what this word really means.
When you travel more often in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage storms there.
There would be a few bags more or less none - unlike the street, where no one wants to trick on the food remains of others.
I've already seen the day when the cities and communities are going to have to get rid of it - and the fast food chains have to ask for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After a strong criticism yesterday, President Obama made a withdrawal in his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands have received a notice from their insurer, the Republicans have thrown the president before the last few days that he has deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the notices, Obama asked those Americans who received such notifications to look for a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than expected.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the people who made insurance themselves had to look around for another tariff, because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a Sebelius who was put behind her at the last hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with the Republican representative Billy Long from Missouri, about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly insisted on why the "Architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce a state-funded insurance in order to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government officer who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday to the American news station CNN claimed that Israeli combat aircraft had attacked an air weapons base in Syrian Latakia one day before.
The goal was to have been "raketten and related equipment" which the Israeli government had feared that they were intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, said CNN.
The Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab Al-Arabiya broadcaster had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot in the night of Wednesday on Thursday, and the Israelis were responsible for this.
The Israeli Channel 2 television station showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles were visible, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government officer saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
In the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hisbollah earlier, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply the Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented confession that the US spying has gone too far.
John Kerry indicated, with an unexpected recognition, that the United States' defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes was disregarded by saying that in certain cases spying had gone too far.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive disclosures of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The US government has come into a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the part of its allies.
On a video-linked speech at the London Open Government Conference Kerry said: 'The President and I, as well as others in the government, have undoubtedly learned some things that have almost passed through autopilots, simply because the ability to do what is still going back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War as well as, of course, to September 11'.
He then admitted, as the first high-level member of the U.S. government, that the US spying had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to make it clear, so he conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of the good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added: "We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop this before it happened?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned before such plans.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to scatter the concerns about the alleged American spying and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board in our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is a Democrat in the Senate for the first time and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their trouble with the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies, although the Head of the Secret Service this week stated that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from documents transmitted by Snowden, according to which the NSA had supervised the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult Murphy said that his authority was preparing the congress trip to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route will still be developed.
While Murphy emphasised that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "first words".
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes that they themselves have been using for years.
"But we can change our monitoring programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also be met with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland on the weekend to discuss the role of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jumping joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from using the FSV Mainz 05 Federal League outward game at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is a member of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
To date, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his mission in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best hits with six hits.
Because the mainzers already have to renounce the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian lodges an appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of having made a false statement after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10th, while two other men held her.
Later, however, video camera recordings showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after having been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to have developed the story.
Until the trial, she was in custody on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phukets instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her to go back to Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she makes holidays in the resort Krabi in South Thailand.
On the part of the court it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand might have been trying to improve its attacked tourist image, and therefore there is a statement.
