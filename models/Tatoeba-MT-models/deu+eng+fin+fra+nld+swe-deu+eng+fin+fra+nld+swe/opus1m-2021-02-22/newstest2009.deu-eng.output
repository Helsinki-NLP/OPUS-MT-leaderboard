The Prague Stock Exchange falls down against business closure.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange joined the entry from Monday at the beginning of Tuesdays when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time was the reason for the invasion on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector in the Czech Republic, also shows.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the shares on the Asian stock exchanges on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the business day, but later it was possible to offset some of the losses, thus the decline decreased to about 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8%, and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6% according to its index.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," says the Head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent from the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to the words of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected by the invasion.
A bloodbad of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbad on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the largest invasion in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost 7%, he had recorded a similar break-in last in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft was not going to pass in the House of Deputies, the index experienced a free case.
Congress admits: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
The vote will be taken at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, this does not mean any victory yet.
In fact, Congress Members still need to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank said this to the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, different reports suggest that the plan could be agreed at the earliest time on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor in boosting financial markets.
However, then there is a "deprivation" due to the complex mechanisms, as can be used to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how a package to stabilise the market should look," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to their words, a final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of non-selling mortgage assets from financial corporations that fall into serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective in the market.
You have to continue the health plan even further, but I think we are at the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's democratic senator Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
In fact, this would help to calm investors before business on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congress decision could affect business on Monday.
To date, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, it is also unclear whether the negotiations could still fail in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will continue to experience some changes.
The total amount allocated to support the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush asked.
However, the Congress can block the dividend of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush appraises progress in negotiations positive
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote on its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained based on the acquisition of funds for the purchase of poor mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American president Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "value the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The President of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, announced that the legislators agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for this.
"We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages that it buys up, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek does not consider it to be decisive.
"A lot more important is that the congressmen agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that there is an adoption is the most important at this moment," said Marek.
Duell on knives cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone yet.
So it seems, of course, that it is better to buy just one phone.
Despite everything, there are enough reasons why you should put yourself on an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Surely you hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also simplified with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
Here too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for one player, but a pink-floyd fan will probably hardly handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranged.
The lifespan of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do, they don't even create a meaning.
No modern device is used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phoneing and simulating, it can reproduce music and videos, recording both, it has a better, a worse photo device, and maybe can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
However, the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than 10 to 12 hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (particularly the simplest) are much more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones to be unable to play music for more than a few hours.
If you make calls from time to time, you prefer to buy yourself a charger for the office for safety - that is also true for more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one loading time.
Another problem is that if you want to overplay the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB closure, and not every phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be finished with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
For players you do not need special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves set up a music library, arranged according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices represent only the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can use more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular ask for the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, also the operating comfort.
If music is especially scenery for you and you just listen to it briefly every day, for example, in the tramway, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every cell phone can do.
You don't have to check which music formats a phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding websites of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a suggestive argument for why you should put a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of providers is bad and is usually limited only to rapid radio heat.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that in the future the music industry will dominate this kind of sale of music (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet).
The cell phone is wearing most of them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
It is important, however, whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless free speaker.
If not, you can rely on the integrated loudspeaker that has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are present.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player in turn lies in easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest - player (see selection) can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar to the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile internet and a subsequent horrifying invoice for data transfers.
Which device should be taken now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (Type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then take Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort comes to one single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually, is the most important one here.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider comes to the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something lacking here - a virtual provider who makes the classics at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting for him for long.
The fact that the Czech mobile providers work on the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on mobile.cz.
This also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming fees, there is so likely a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a pénétration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators are happy to shy on the fact that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) also often agrees to this, Pavel Dvo.k, who had often stated in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has so many opportunities (almost he would probably not find any more frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market led to a significant price reduction, which then also had to respond to by the classic mobile operators.
There were similar votes in the UK to those in the Czech Republic before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market.
However, it has proved that there is room for such providers and that these can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples long.
In February, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus climb to the five largest provider of the country.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually look out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it may also be quite a good move to put on a non-crystle target group.
This provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Good guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar approach as in Poland could be taken in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic chancelessly, mobile operators mean
But it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile provider conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"While we talk about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
The market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region is more likely," says Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, a press speaker of the financial group Penta in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in the launch of a virtual mobile provider has long been showing the Group GTS Novera, who wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have negotiated on this possibility with all Czech mobile providers on a number of occasions.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiations," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that in the Czech Republic there is room for a full virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
To date, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srše. from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Further suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová rarely adds to O2's statement: "We have not yet found a viable and both-sided project on which we could continue to build."
And she adds: "A virtual provider will hardly appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer already in place in order to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is precisely what we view as the best from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to seek a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand; another provider would be more competitive, this would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be facilitated to enter the market?
The fact that the suppliers can draw a string when it comes to something also proves the long way and then about the emergence of U:fon.
At the time when U:fon came on the market, the strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ was due to the company T-Mobile.
This also proves the information available to the public from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is right as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive field of the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would have high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is amazed.
This is not just the position of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately, unlike the UK and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It owns exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to the whole problem of its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
To date, no such agreement has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers," says Kristián Chalupa in his answer to our question from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a wording would not be surprised by representatives of the suppliers.
This is more than worrying by an authority representing the interests of consumers and, inter alia, ensuring that no one abuses his position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it should be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost already touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely equal petrol price at the petrol stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not found any signs of any action against competition in this case, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their activities on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the Telecommunications regulatory authority," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is one single market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different viewpoint - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile provider - logically - has monopoly for his network.
This means that he must take a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not support this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting noticeably similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera mentioned) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The waging of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS is distant from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent Novelle of the Telecommunications Act, the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not been achieved, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must only know that too well, but probably they have other interests.
I'll be fine if no one watches
Notwithstanding this, the operation of any pseudovirtuous provider, of which there are just a few in the Czech mobile networks, remains.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
Normally, they are companies operating in the field of multi-level marketing.
Private mobile telephone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to selected companies.
The joke of the case is that the company appears to be a classic company customer in relation to the operator who orders a lot of SIM cards.
As an important customer he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that something like this does not speak around with the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator resists such an approach.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not result in negligible profits, at the same time, as opposed to actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone on their name, so they cannot fully possess the normal customers of mobile operators."
This alone, however, would have to happen to the ČTÚ at least strangely.
Furthermore, another question arises for the ÚOHS.
Mobile operators close their eyes in front of such an approach, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want it does not have to satisfy itself with the supplier's statement that they would not know anything about it and their terms of business would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasised several times in the text, the entry into the market of virtual providers led to a significant price decline in the various services.
In practical terms, in all countries where virtual providers have emerged, classic suppliers have tried to prevent their formation practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which tried not to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers, were involved in these moments.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are thrown up all the case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot lose the impression that ambiguity in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider will soon appear, the Czech mobile market may soon return.
If a provider permits the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And then the Czechs will not finally call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymne on the day of the Czech state, where is my home country.
The hymn was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji★ Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir and in an instrumental version.
Kateřina Kn.ková and Adam Plachetka took over the vocals.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi★ and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can just listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier, he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers for the solo variants with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you could understand the text well, so that there would be a harmony," said the director.
The Czech national hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj sounded for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the stable theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic component of the national hymn after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols remained after the creation of the Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" hymn
The Prague transport companies also transport for the first time on Wednesday to a chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of Prague's transport companies will enter as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket enter a metro, tram or bus.
They can currently buy around a hundred thousand people who own the chipcard Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (used from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously play it on their chip card, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations of Muzeum, Můstek, Nádra. Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Latviaany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons have also been available on the websites of transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have been waiting regularly in long snakes for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon on the Internet, which is played on the open card in one of the 13 branches of the city library.
"In these places there is also a switch with trained staff available to travellers, who advises interested parties on the Internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can also be played on the open card on self-control machines, which are mounted in some subway valves.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remember ticket devaluers, the passengers may have already noticed in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it will be eighty," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The use of the machines that will work from tomorrow onwards is easy.
You just have to import the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow onwards not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia come mainly into the capital.
"In the trains that are part of the Prague integrated traffic, the train crews have readers with which they can verify the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation's ticket control. This organisation sets out the schedules for the Prague traffic operators.
The pre-urban buses have card reading devices at the checkout by the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place on the side of the cash.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to verify the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive pre-urban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudets called for a referendum from the United States
In 1945 the Sudet Germans had requested the joining of the Bohemian Forest with the United States.
This comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a desire in 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans would have turned to the US presidents.
This comes, among other things, from a letter that has been kept in a private archive and which is stored today in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure that the American units do not enter the German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as a liberator," says a letter signed with the words "Men who are in the heart of the fate of the Sudites".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudet Germans - knowing the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, ignorance, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection rule over the Bohemian forest for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter million inhabitants, you will speak to a state that is foreign to us, trying to oppress and eliminate minorities, and having contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," reads the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubts the sense of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or want to live under the protection rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, some witnesses believe that it is a good picture of the expectations of the Sudet Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had a chance of such a situation at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudets.
Again others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
In the war he was employed as a German Budweiser at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British prison at the end of the war and was brought to a camp of war prisoners to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemical Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would pass on to them," said Chalupa.
No one of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia expected that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
It would also be possible to characterise the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš .eb.ek promises to put drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on the radio, on the cinema, on the internet, but also on flyers.
It should take the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
And they also remember being belted before driving.
The campaign aims to speak especially to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people calling for emotions.
This also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are on a sign in large letters.
And in a blood spot the word "pay".
This is intended to mean that you can pay a moment of ignorance with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Angel Saxony countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic recordings of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and peaches for drivers
"For the drivers the motto applies sugar bread and peaches.
Sugar bread means, for example, that when driving red, it saves time.
The squirrel is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Ko.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective are in his view Tables that alert the drivers to a danger.
"If you put up a static table that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer perceive them," says Koʹn.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has voted for the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan hills, if peace could be concluded with Palestine and Syria in exchange for that.
He stressed this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Akronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to depart to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israel territory), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to abandon part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty across the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he further confirmed.
Deduction from the Golan hills
Olmert advocated Israel's deduction from the Golan hills, which he considered is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the side of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a deduction from the Golan hills," said Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to renounce to get the Golan hills back.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with the (Shiitian) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiitian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," concreetly the Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to run
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus by the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers may run on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-twenty-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment with all the unfortunateness next to the driver, on the least secure seat in the car, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or severely brake at the moment when the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing spaces after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided in the bus, travellers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing spaces; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed in relation to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not agree to travellers' movement at first.
Later this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travellers are allowed to go to the toilet during their journey when they have their seats," he said.
The law doesn't know any steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes that role.
However, there is no legislation that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the concept of vehicle crew, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law covers this issue later.
"It depends whether the bus also has standing spaces in the product authorisation.
That's all," he emphasises.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing pitches and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing pitches and a higher permissible speed and remote buses without standing pitches with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the specialist says
The BESIP traffic safety professional Jaroslav Ho★n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid way of driving, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulences come, and the stewardess can hit his head."
"But if a bus stops sharply, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just as in the city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal rules," he says and also says that this issue is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services by Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his or her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers when entering.
This would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the absence of Stewards in his bus. His company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we're fighting from the beginning.
Earlier or later this ends with any fatal accident," he had not quite a year ago said to Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who had worked for society for two years, was accidented in the accident of a line bus to Naples.
The Slovenian truck was probably curved off the standing strip without flashing and had blocked the bus's drive.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two places were sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgement, but it also expects a financial compensation from the guilty person.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a 30-person expert team of the Ministry of Transport has already worked over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the road," says Ho★n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Stewards as something that could significantly jeopardise the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with control of the safety of buses within the competence of police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf’s hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of great words in the letter from the WestLB Board to the staff of the House.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could arise, says the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incentive to further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
For the attacked WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute, which has recently made clear by the North Rhine-Westphalian state government that it is time to find a future solution.
However, the WestLB has for some time been talking about a connection between the Deka Bank, which knows the savings banks because of their investment funds, and the WestLB - even on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank Manager Franz Waas has informed the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, each carried by half of the Landesbanken and the Sparkassen Associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve capital market transactions or parts thereof.
The talks have, of course, just begun, as it says at the financial court.
The Deka Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt Financial Place, is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked like the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing became from this Trial League.
The Hessian state government opposed the participation of Helaba in the project.
Even the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there has always been thoughts about a connection of the Deka bank with Landesbanken.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, president of Helaba, had voted against plans for a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the knowledge that a collapse of the various houses in the public sector is needed seems to be mature.
After the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, BayernLB could first become closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, it gradually assumes the partners.
In the south, she would only be more junior partner, although she has so far been through the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In conjunction with the West LB, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen- und Giroverband, which is involved in the Helaba with 85 percent, has moved a rifle in the beginning of the year.
At least stay the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question with which the business model should ensure the future capacity of the Landesbanken has not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a disintegration of the West LB, but there is no wish.
In the letter of the Executive Board there, it is also mentioned that a "total solution" for the House is certainly being sought.
How this can be brought under a hat with the connection of individual units with the deca bank will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer facade of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bear and proves to the about 200 October party travelers that deep sounds can produce his throat.
Elena's giving Luca a blow, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking place next to Puorta Nuova train station, start four buses this evening at 23.45 pm, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected at 6.30 pm.
Three buses are reserved mainly to the Italians, on a bus traveling exclusively Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they celebrated already in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelcimitate food and a glass with wide silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been driving to the October Festival, three tours are on their own this year.
At night, on the meadow, back at 22:30.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Beer, faithfully to the Bavarian purity order, the health insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Fast it will be quiet in the bus, travelers sleep.
All right, they'll still need their powers.
In Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian marks on the highway 8 will take a break just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at half seven in the morning on the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow cap.
On it is left "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, along with Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it is said to run!", Marco calls into the morning.
Run! Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, screaming Marco, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget about drinking money.
"The security officers show that we are acting well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone."
Thirdly: "Tonight, find point half eleven again!" Do you understand?
And now we're going to meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap is bound to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be warned for the retreat.
It is the second weed week, known as "Italian week".
There are no exact figures; the talk is of 50,000 who travel through the Alps and come into the beer tent, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have traveled extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics, in which the Italians (approximately 60 operations) and Austrians (approximately 80) are first with about 200 medical services.
The farmhouse is particularly popular among Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Bundesfinanzminister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How well the politician used the word "relative" and also added that the German banking sector is not spared from crisis developments.
For it has now occurred in the weekend.
The Munich real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in Dax, receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from the turbulences on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should only interest the part it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which the State financer had refinanced himself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible due to the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve was reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also slightly dropped from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net returns from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous period, revenues from credit bonds and certain securities and from the resolution of provisions in the credit business had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the repayment of downstream settlement costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest according to the tax regime and from the business management of group companies, the yield reduction had still been moderate with around 16 per cent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state-financer had first speculated himself with commercial real estate credits, which had then been divided into the Aareal Bank.
Because classical state funding was too low, the Depfa had then increased its commitment to infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciations which will have a "essential material effect" on the Group's profit and loss account, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financer since Depfa took over.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the crediting among the banks is resuming to a large extent, as the banks were hearing their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for a part - around 50 billion euros - of the Depfa loan portfolio.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the Group's funding needs are covered with the loan for a predictable time and the company is "protected from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets".
From other sources, it should be heard that the funds would be refinancing secured by the end of 2009.
The HRE CEO Georg Funke, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for a predictable time.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the Bank to hope.
But given the dynamics and imbalances of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unimaginable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be slided out.
After the late Sunday evening the hearing after the bank was still before the insolvency, even the at least provisional rescue could not calm the minds.
The stock price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the borrowing rates are quite good.
If priority debts are hardly moving, the rates of priority bonds are more pronounced.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are concerned and, understandably, the maturity beyond 2009.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds formerly appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their worth after the sharpening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Depfa crisis, must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the banknotes, governments and less-favoured business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely retirement of pensions can be assumed.
Or there's something that hardly anyone else dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports overwhelming with sub-nationalization, the probability of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is especially expected for long-term believers to prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitment.
Short-term investors can still use a final indent to form a loss premium for future repayment tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to present itself at Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to scream: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I didn't walk away.
The beginning of the class at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from 8 o'clock until a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room' at 20 a.m.
But before the class began, I was about to introduce myself.
I am not the guy who likes to speak before people, nor before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I've worn an old skirt of my guest mother, including blouse, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the punt and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, coming from Germany and having a birthday in a week.
At the time, I was very happy that I had started learning the language more than two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all whispered, kicked and whispered and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'small, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me shook pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was stunned.
All of them talked up and spit and asked me holes in the belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break then all their Bentos packed out.
My guest mother also made me such a lunch box - that's something different from the deserted German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu mantle.
Mostly I don't have any blurred glimpse of what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It stands that everything is really delicious.
Well, besides the salty prunes, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then creates particularly artificially - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm so excited if I can watch this too.
'Why Japan?', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I started learning a little Japanese sometime.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a poor place for tradition, morals and customs.
And there's a great value for it here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here either, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Also rats have feelings
A rat or a squirrel fleeing in danger means that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Many animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check if they feel the same if they act like us?
For several years, contributions from famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine Edge.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers in a series to the question "What do you think true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other state of consciousness, without that I or anyone else have been able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and touch questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter an invasive area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, she does the same thing as many other animals: she dies, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, which some scientists conclude from a similar subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the side prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man even differs from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic is likely to be in the linguistic nature of man: As such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, is likely to differ greatly from most of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or analyzed on the basis of our own experience because of the special hardware, its research poses great problems.
Most of my speeches refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
One could examine the awareness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one is more likely to rely on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasises the importance of prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What is the result of the feelings?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own conscious brains.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain-located defence system (or its consequences, like physical reactions) proves memory.
In this sense, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and especially people.
Combined with linguistic nature, fine graduations of feeling arise because we can differentiate and categorize states by means of words and grammar to attribute them to others as well as to ourselves.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of Cortex and the brain tribe are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain tribe.
Since this network had not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could be involved in cross-generational feelings.
I cannot contradict this purely theoretically, but I think it is invincible.
Pankseep argues about what fear appears to be in rats and humans, and it is likely that in both cases it is the same: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they act similarly?
A shark flies at risk whether it also feels fear?
In my view, behavioural similarity can not prove even equal experience.
Although neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, however, they do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if one could prove that to man: How did one want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sharks (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circles and language), I prefer to explore emotional behaviour rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neuronal level, provided that the same is seen in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than walk on a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must now work at the highest speed," said the Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
Following numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN Association has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The Commission had met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Several first-classists had been convicted only in the last season of manipulation for forced depression, and then even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Emperor Dennis Quaid defeats
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outdated her goddamn Dennis Quaid as a adultery breaker.
He shys - and beats back.
Late Rose War with the ex-wife Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players now have an unpleasant dispute with each other - in general.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had for the first time commented on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud had not been experienced until after the divorce.
An occasion for the soul triptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - is told the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quad's response to his outing as a unfaithful husband was clear: "It was unfortunate", the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" said that "Meg repeatedly recycles and denounces the history of our relationship".
It is also "deplorable" that Jack's 16-year-old son is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and controversies that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has been married again and recently became the father of twins.
And so close his inspirations with the side hip: "My life goes on anyway.
I appreciate being happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Lower prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany were even cheaper for up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become more affordable - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant break in the second quarter after price increases in the first quarter.
After years of price increase in the hotel market, overnight stays in many places have already been cancelled.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities still rose by an average of 6.9 per cent compared with 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year earlier.
As a reason for this, American Express sees the weak dollar price that led to a "decreasing travellust of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the trend also showed upwards in flight prices:
As a result of kerosin congestion, travellers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1% more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-range flights were even more expensive than 29.2%.
From April to June, prices for Economy Class flights decreased by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class prices were much lower.
In Germany prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 per cent and declined by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
In German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the price decline is the decline in economic growth, explains the company.
Demand fell in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the USA and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of tension were the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have bankrupted in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is a table guide.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a working eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge breaklanding for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher was only late in the game and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precise, she went over his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger swept in the cabin of the Hamburg arena.
Much was not going into the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were sitting back in their places.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than a few fluffy actors.
And so his request also found hearing in responsible place.
Assist coach Cornelius Jol nicked and lifted the thumbs in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation was not yet carried out.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "please wished".
The 1:0 (1:0) was due to Mladen Petric's headball match (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their association as a class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to arrange this," said Marcell Jansen.
He believes that the table interim certificate is more for the unpredictability of the League than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-commissioned entrances - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torschütz Petric and the Jansen resigned by FC Bayern - finds itself slowly, but she can't shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," Jol said.
After the loss of vote
There's anxiety on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package broke the Dow Jones by 700 points at times.
This was the biggest loss of points within one day in his history.

No title could be added.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares decreased by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
The rescue plan will provide funds for the purchase of so-called fake mortgage papers.
But the sum is not to be paid on a beat, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive equity option notes from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of the corresponding price development in order to reduce the burden on the public fund.

Dark matter influences flight from space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research ensures ratlessness: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manöver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory could not be quite correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold teddy.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among scientists - the swing-by-anomalie.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, in which they receive additional vibration in the gravitation field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been astonishing for years: the aircars do not behave 100 percent as would be expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by-anomalie.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general relativity theory, which describes the attractiveness of matter through a curve of the space, could not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomalie using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made out in the universe.
"A responsible for the anomalie could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
Obviously, it is based on an attraction, whose effect can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter is good at least a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists dragged in Egypt will be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
At a shooting before release, six hostages were killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Losses negotiations are already scheduled to run.
Germans are always getting into the sight of kidnappers.
World ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists dragged in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by the Egyptian public television, the Arab television broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media consistently.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well-safe and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the abductors were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the abductors.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was "only to receive the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling for a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led a woman to kill herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had confessed eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal Court in Truro learned that he regularly attached his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs Randle killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had bound her and tied her eyes before he carried out sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had given up her life.
In April 2007, her true father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a confession letter, which ended so, "I used to attach her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would end before the court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet Officer, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged with the "public security law".
The man was seconded from the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intention.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You thought it would be internally addressed by the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Attorney General recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he transferred contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in mind
British housing companies could have a cost of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerant" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged each year to the 700 financial undertakings accepting deposits.
The Compensation Programme for Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted cautiously ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest rates for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies need to obtain 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted cautiously during the real estate recovery are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
Interests due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since building companies are both sides of organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting company have been carried out.
The retailers should decide themselves whether they would like to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied deposit
A court in Bangladesh rejected a warranty request from the former Prime Minister Shech Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused bail regarding the charge for extortion of 50 million taka (727,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the military-supported transitional government to grant her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that, although their detention was suspended to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, as part of her release, whether she will be able to remain free if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's cheques' petition because it says that she does not have to receive a cheques because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers agree that they need a deposit to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance party president on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-supported transitional government had taken over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Shech Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears for the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent Anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a United Nations speaker, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or impede the thousands of vaccinating personnel.
BskyB loses action in the case of ITV
BskyB lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of ITV's share raises doubts about the independence of ITV, which has motivated the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing the pressure on ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that BskyB wanted to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. US Attorney
The US Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The Special Detective Nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officers who were interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious accusations including criminal action have not been fully investigated or clarified," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal to a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to declare was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 resigned nine US prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the public prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the termination as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-level Republican Congress members, while others had refused to investigate the accusations of electoral fraud by the Democrats.
U.S. US Attorneys are mandated to investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
Alberto Gonzales, then head of the Ministry of Justice, was fired because of the redundancies and, in the final effect, has set up his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has critically addressed Gonzales' role by bearing the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, giving up his leadership role and showing himself "extraordinarily desinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Consultant of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the "Q Award" award for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold price next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for awards this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released as single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and has sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems over the past few years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after it had collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, singles, side roads and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is hard to tell even experienced taxi drivers and long-standing residents where extra place is located, simply because most people have never heard of it.
This tiny road is located in East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without accessing Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty street than after an active transit road.
There are no street signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants Extra Place to repack in order to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the building block.
However, the urban department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers to keep the road in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the District Officer in the Municipal Council 3.
"Only very little room has remained in possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There might be offers to repair and operate the road what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago to reinstall the small streets and seats that are intended, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed street and make it a public meeting point," she said and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Building Protection Department said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than to manage.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood, The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street was named in 1802 when a large farm, which belonged to Philip Minthorne, was divided among its many children and a narrow country was no one claimed.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrock Memorial, closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as a scenery for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the Gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the extinct city"), has published a part of the city story discussion about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorkers" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow hole that remains dark even over the day and is marked by roasted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rains."
With a few exceptions, the road looked exactly like this recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that led earlier to CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing shop.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of excavated newspapers.
Some passagers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up slightly.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, humid and disgusting.
Discussion on bilingual training: education in English language environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-language training.
Lance T. Izumi, Chief Scientific Officer in Kalifonical Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-writer of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing the Spanish voters is a complex task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of completing school successfully for Afro-American and Spanish students is lower than for white students" - what is right.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama's education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a two-lingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to the two-language training, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing the distance in school services.
As an example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Spanish and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent of students of the fourth class have passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were well assessed in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, continuous control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach to training in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should observe, according to the head of the school Linda Mikels.
This approach focuses on the almost exclusive use of the English language in the field of teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual training, said to me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school such as the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English learning students?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easier, but the educational positions within its own party (the national imaging associations have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and his own consistent support of bilingual training make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by pointing out that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialise them.
The oil price is falling as a result of further fears about the economy
The oil price fell strongly on Monday due to the fear that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The raw oil terminals on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel during the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences on Wall Street and by strong storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak in July of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, and then again, as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again concerned, although Congress representatives had announced that they agreed on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from being completed.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup is supposed to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on weekends and led to a rescue plan, it seems to have failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to fall.
Analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"With the outlook of the goods markets, we are most concerned about the spread of the US virus worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year and their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 have decreased by 20%.
Team record by second-quarter series
Interior Defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been on the Jets Tricot in the last eight and a half years more than anyone else.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like that before," Ellis said.
After a silly game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once shook out as a defenseman and the other once 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make much effort," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catching, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner split up.
Foreign Defender Darrelle Revis took off a crashed throw and turned it into a 32-Yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then made a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the crazyest.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recuperated the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into 34 to 0 leadership.
These were most of the points the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, because the jets allowed to reach 21 points in the third quarter without reaching a single one, Mangini said: "Truly, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Outspoken Gebrselassia strikes its world record
Haile Gebrselassia from Ethiopia has once again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to reach the 42.2 kilometers route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassia improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
==References====External links====External links==*Official website
Last month, Gebrselassia left the Olympic marathon in Beijing out of fear, which might have been exaggerated in the aftermath that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since trackers such as Gebrselassia and Paul Tergat have changed on long distances from Kenya, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassia told the press that he had had cramps in his wad two weeks ago and could therefore not train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after break and not roasted back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end everything great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopian rivals from East Africa - that he orchestrated his races excessively, avoided many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relied too much on the race leaders as if it were a train race, and made world record of the race.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassia had reached the centre of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassia after the Tempomakers had dropped.
A little more than three miles before finish, Gebrselassia made its last start to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all time.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her course by sending a quartet out of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and strains in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the excavations of the recreational parks around Orlando, just a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, lies a quiet city in which the pride and complications of the Afro-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crocodile places, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrim.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida guide, which was produced by the German writer project at the time of depression – is in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, committed and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what he escapes."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial relations, many here are still tired of being observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a community member of the oldest church of the city.
It must be true."
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a fortress of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on guard.
And so rightly, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from heart and were written in mouth like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five points in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freak like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston reader led to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Besides the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white modern school, with its maintained gardens and playgrounds that always take care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and always fits in hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said Ella Dinkins, a 90-year-old, one of Johnson's girls, exalted the Hurston by citing the men who sang songs about their beauty, full of sexual appeals.
She added, "Many people didn't like this."
Here you still remember Hurtson as a lively excentricity who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she usually did this without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed with pants, in a city that today imagines something on her respectable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most people were fascinated, while many disguised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "they never stayed too long," he added while he swam in his chair, on a backside terrace that looks at Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and had lost her books.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was put in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous tomb.
In Eatonville there was no big commemorative celebration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance at least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-speed motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-speed main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"In that time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting off the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955 Hurston, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court's request to force integration by calling its decision against the school council in the case of Brown "political rather than respecting my race".
People today say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, they weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his young people.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning and were embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, the citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurston - black authors, actors and artists who have gone away from prejudices, as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book boards, and made it again part of the American literature canon.
The remote road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter once again stood in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy by building the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-way distance revived the city, accelerated the whole at high speed, woke up real civil pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more trainers, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos it can sometimes feel like a backdrop in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black today.)
Exteriors looking for the history of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white and black men in field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, are still afraid that her sheltered community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival became larger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and busy, foolish and pervasive as any other race and peoples in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that you can hear in Mr. Franklin's nephew's voice, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college, to work in the city administration or in the police that he might need some help.
And even the young people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who go through here alone will think, "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and for a moment look at your story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are in New York, we are talking about a flowing financial latitude.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the box-like offices with the glass façades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror work day every day since the stock exchange crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea weighs along the townsides and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still sneak around between apartments, like human packing animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like bar lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for their breakfast bowls on the bargaining dining stands and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16:00 and 19:00.
It didn't feel like a crisis until Thursday afternoon, due to all the world's fall, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to place my duty in time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people stood snakes.
Not to the cash switches to collect or pay money, but to the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to Macy's store and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I snake.
Contrary to me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, from places where they traveled, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had picked up money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to a building parkasse), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers as a family.
Last year 15 of these banks have gone quietly and quietly.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went into bankruptcy management and when the Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings facilities worth $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and store employees brought their bars before me to a bank considered safe, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
All normal New Yorkers have dedicated themselves to a flowing financial credit in recent weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket, with so much confidence, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went out of the house and their deceased executive president Dick Fuld, as if she was getting rid of a coward.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my residential block, came out of our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going into risko anymore."
Muslemic graves shaken during right-hand run in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Flemish, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is represented, stripped with a red line.
The police accuse legal extremists of tombing at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend in the extreme right parties of considerable profits in the country's parliamentary elections.
In the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were seriously damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The offenders sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officers consider this to be an attempt to hide the motive of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said they were " deeply shaken" about the message of the grave shame, which took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans tends to end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is taking place in Austria after the country went right at yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties received almost 30% of the votes, in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their voting rights were criticised by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, was in favour of a ban on head towels and Burkas and even expressed his reluctance to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last gathering in Vienna he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minettes with the argument that these political symbols of continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe are.
Surveys and analyses that were carried out immediately after the elections and which state that the extreme rights of the country's most politically strong block are, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel lock for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who has been convicted of the sexual abuse of children, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judges put Glitter on a six-month lock after informing the control authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kent were allowed to impose a foreign travel lock last Thursday after they presented evidence to the judges of Glitter's crimes for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Court in Kent, but was represented by the Attorney General Corker Binning.
EIn Speakers of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday 25 September, the Kent Police Office at the Ashford Court requested permission to prevent foreign travel by Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the Register of Sexual Crimes, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a 5-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual criminals in the country in order to minimise any risk that could exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after a few things.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter him and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers insisted that he would return to Britain.
Lastly, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request his registration as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior Jacqui Smith was calmed and satisfied that Glitter was stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no rods, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the great flame dancers who abandon the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical for the personality, the depth of a stolen view or the strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer represents varied theatricals of some stages on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. He was not very well known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamecoplay at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of the photography of the Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day, explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the largest flamencomasters with the camera."
Bauer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', went on a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that reminded of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, singing or instrumental play in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, which with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, something that becomes visible in the form of listening, being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to catch up with this idea two years ago and to realise it as 'portraits of the sports veterans' ('sportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer is too happy to photograph the people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult generation.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you don't know at times at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco from today with the title `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he just writes is `a fabulousness'.
He doesn't know yet where the novel's action takes place and what it's about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project that he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived for twenty years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel prize winner admitted that the project with which he is concerned is ‘a great skill’ and ‘all points out that he should not write the novel’.
`If I had made a good idea, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel at some point', so he closed his participation at the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days, he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the premium of the Festival Hay Festival and which most attendees gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had a public before him, which realized that the Peruan, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not given enough time to go through everything again: how his appeal to literature was created from `anormal adventure desire', `freude in reading' and `more than it appears; how he writes and maintains discipline' to complement `the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his appeal and what `memoranda's' are the foundations for his stories.
The Spanish novel writer admitted that there is `no way' to measure and how to know whether books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience', emphasised Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is `effects' and `the people even more apart', so I asked the writers `don't leave them with ease' and `accept the responsibility' for his vocation `accepting'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: the bullfighters were partly out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfighter to complete the festival in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bull battle.
Thus, the festival of inconsistent weather was suspended, so two of three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bull battle could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadores consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bull strugglefarena.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
The same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galopping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a majority of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava two people wanted to escape the control of their car, loaded with two thousand kilograms of Haschish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Traffic checks in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers urged the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilograms of Haschish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man 28 years old known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The person arrested was charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the region of Álava had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped a few kilometers on the perimeter. At the moment the drivers went out of the car to escape to a forest area over a land road.
The police of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2.178 kilos of Haschisch, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschisch bundles, which were later led to precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundle to other police stations.
In addition, the officials noted that the mark was `double', so that it did not conform to the mark indicated in the vehicle papers, so an additional arrest was made for the falsification of official documents.
The Ertzaintza city police continue the investigation to arrest the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was brought to a police station for hearing. He will be presented to the detainee in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A witness had observed how she tried to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesperson of the California traffic police report to the magazine `People'.
The Witness told me in detail that Locklear `d pushed through gas pedal after 16:30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and when she drove backwards, she caught herself on her sunbrows a few times.
Sometime later, the Witness, who at first probably had not known the actress that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and left the car.
The Witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had ‘life fear of Locklears’.
When the police line came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thus blocked traffic.
'They seemed to be unorientational', so they brought the cops to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine', says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and brought to a local detention detention at 7 p.m.
Two months ago Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Left Association should be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the Chief Coordinator of the VL and Members of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Education Association will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the Town Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the way the party has to be confronted with the city council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the infringements of the rules that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted on the maximum transparency of such cases'.
With regard to this topic, he stressed that the education has `a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de Mayo': Hero book by Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish rebellion against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment in filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to ‘present a lot of personalities and social analysis’, which he has always admired at the works of the famous novel writer, today Carci explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de Mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and will later be shown on the telemadrid broadcaster as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures that his ‘childhood dream’ was fulfilled thanks to this work. This was thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story was based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made for spinning by the Autonomous Community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he added, the `one-time opportunity' with the help of decorations and related clothing, the image of `the confused Spain, which chose the false leader for the fight, because the people had been resigned by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that funding could not be expected, such as for `Alatrist' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as for `Sangre de Mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be turned.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of the film in `Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual work: he stood on the stage with the actors with whom one first has to try before you start to turn and for those who had not done casting, he appeared `humiliating' and giving respect, `a part of the career of the director of the film consists in providing help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what happens in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many performers he encounters in `Sangre de Mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete messas de billar francés' and not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
`At the beginning, you think you work for the descendant, later you realize that it's only for the benefit, and now you're happy if you have produced another movie', Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert for Eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian and was in favour of the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in time between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
`We're not trying to tell about her life, especially to preserve her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, I felt the butterfly's dance like Guajira, or the serpent's dance like Tango.
Her dance was sensual and I've been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The stage expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again in one of her ideas, as he did in La puerta; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored."
The scene also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he ` assumes the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in whom he is always in love.'
This work also tells a certain way about the life of this woman, known in places as far as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
`I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a given era and whose works are no longer appreciated today and they are even less appreciated', Bayón claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, offers a similar atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008).
The Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' published by Pedro Tabenero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can imagine bad without Paul Newman
`Many times God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in `Sensation reporter', and from the then ruling image of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he returned in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
"What sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford crying, "my life and my country were the greatest dreads of his life."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerated.
As the `father' of the cinema and the country of the father, he died at a sad moment when fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, in which the defeated self-esteem of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to restore dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you do not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered, like various losses, both profits: from the foundation, which has enjoined the fight against drugs and was founded in honour of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country where it cost him a lot of effort to fight a deadly nutritional culture.
A wide wave of surprises suggests to take over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
‘We have left the greatest of us all’, George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few who are trusted today to try to live as Paul Newman lived: earned high standards of righteousness, leading a responsible private life far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He was divorced once and then married Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?’ he often jokeed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
They say that of all the great roles he played, he was no one as proud of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentionful grandpa, and the Philanthrope's.
The streets in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we prepared for it?
Yes, we follow the example of old streets, I say it's not true!
It was described as the perfect road, and after my assessment, it was the worst road with everything around and around which there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to take account of the evaluation and I could examine it, something like that would clearly not have passed through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, they should also give you everything (including chips to avoid the staves on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is to go there only for that reason) and (after an infinite waiting snake) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it true that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
All right, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting snake of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks behind, even if it had succeeded, but it would be harder to get it back.
In addition, in these 40 minutes it looked like a waiting time for rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a folk revolt and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear at the time of the classification because of this chip I have received, I can think that the output was wrongly stamped out.
Of course, if I was asked for a perfect road, that road would never come to me.
So I think we will dream for a long time of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtually) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft introduced the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planer to move on the company's campus). The system observes what it hears during the entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this `receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place the attendees in the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that leads to her conversation, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only one finding when you consider that Microsoft added one or another feature and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The direction change is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google chrome appeared on the network, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skilled many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, for this more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the 'Fensters'.
What is half used in the computer of existing applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easy, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without any doubt. I give a small example.
I made the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing drink machine is a sign attached: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used for the searches on the network.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso used it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just as Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well-built priest.
When we start counting the countless Stars performances, we can return to the image of a very strong man, with a spit beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circle.
Basically, this is a typical male cotton T-shirt, sleeveless and tailored.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called `Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the name creation is connected with sport and stems from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' overhears all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut, and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmeres, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very exciting.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is charming, but full of life joy.
Currently the Sisters Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved her home and also made the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in Valentino's dinner.
A very intense working time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and observe women as they are dressed, as they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything is happening in one area and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was a kid, I was enthusiastic about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to whisper in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch out for the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in teaching and at the samples to look into the mirror and feel good.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you turn into the real role of the performer.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and its professionality.
Recently you've become 30, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, yeah.
I feel better than ever, than I'm 30 years old, I feel good.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time I have known that I am becoming a mother because that requires my body and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
I'm not worried about the candidate.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and educate it with much love.
As far as the art of film is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and the last year was played.
That is exactly the case and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very patient and unpleasant and want everything at once that of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not that I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charitable event of their organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothing items from our collection for Mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they are not correct.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing that she is involved in.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this big-hearted thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do so.
To support women in the Third World, what is necessary.
The drivers who can be withdrawn due to the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level to install this system in his car, which prohibits him from launching the car in drunk condition. If he is alcoholic, the car does not jump.
The initiative was already announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the Attorney General. According to it, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for retraining the traffic behaviour.
In addition to the General Public Prosecutor, in accordance with experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of the drivers who were reported more than once because of driving under alcohol influence were again taxed.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the air out of breath and prevents the start of the car when the driver has made an alcohol test; or if a concentration of alcohol is found higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of infringements in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action before it becomes an offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
The House of Deputies will vote tomorrow because of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party's initiative, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British timeliness, at 17:40 a.m., at the time planned by the programme, next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed with the Prince and Prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays have still forced to use the hand as a umbrella to see the royal pair, which went out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, there you can take no people at the airport at this time she's from here or so
No, she's the Spanish woman, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy who give the honorary salve.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long, wind-woven hairs, without ordinary `peep-toes', maybe she was told that there is a storm expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a mexican television reporter waiting for her to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no very excellent fashion designer and bonuses than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and increase young fashion talents internationally.
This is awarded with a cash price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the Mango branch window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried for the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1.335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with the wish to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair in the competition. Everything ended with a luxurious dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken from pain because his brother died recently, ripped himself together. He has drawn the suit from the fashion house and wear some jewelry from ELAH, which were breathtaking. He stood on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honour.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango House, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended with the baron of red shields without jackets, because they borrowed jackets to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the business and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, seized a rod and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always creates a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed linen and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starful sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's how life is.
1001 Council against Stress
There is no 1,000, but a way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the books on September 30th.
The wake-up is a punishment when it rings at 7:00 in the morning, but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computers that lead to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to fight the daily exhaustion and the problems of switching off the working world.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga classes, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 opportunities to relax' and so the rest that gives the book comes into the libraries of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think that it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as work by means of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer rises in your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Sleep Talking
Some children speak at night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened on the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Sure, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, such as during high fever), or regularly (every day, one time a week, one time a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often, connections with other appearances in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (beds at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason to do so.
As we have mentioned earlier, it may be due to very high fiber, stress situations or excessive demand.
Anyway, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite the opposite (scream, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and advised with a specialist to check whether there is a problem, which causes anxiety and is thus created.
We have said it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What can be done is to carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child sleep calmly.
When talking occurs in the sleep, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will remember nothing that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will take it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, when a couple of appearances show fear, it is recommended to be advised or to find out why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams of and why it says that they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear it at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long thirst, Illhouses on the field are finally on a success course again.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torque opportunities and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had difficulty showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long shot passed close to the corner, Illhouses should easily dominate the game, and then Fonderflick succeeded with a long shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the top of the foot, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let through the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with first two torque opportunities fought by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately thereafter with the first gate for the Ill Houses by Marais, which was exactly right to accept a ball again, which had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Ilheusian shooter should not be able to enjoy his happiness long and to be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so his teammates had to continue to play in number.
Denmark, however, did not know how to use this and did not confront an Ilhaeusian eleven with major problems that only a little backwards to ‘compensate’ its defence, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a great confusion.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another exit to Brittany.
In view of the determination of the fishermen to block access to several Bretonian and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to find himself in the finalistère in the port of Guilvinec Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit’, and hoped that he would come with ‘concrete proposals’.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, set up by the Bretonian fishermen, to implement measures in view of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which reached an average record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elysée Palace David Martinon ‘the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their businesses become competitive again and to secure the working conditions and the pay of the seafarers’.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning, they launched protest fairs at Morbihan and Calvados, which caused staves of almost ten kilometres of length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was closed with a lock.
Already on Monday, the seafarers expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the sleeve channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not drive out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvre of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique solved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The members of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before they decided on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the debate planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Bretonian fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible members of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently costs about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 at the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes also said goodbye to the cinematographer Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 supplied aircraft, despite the threatening recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, maintains its supply forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
Up to today Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider providing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday edition, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering spending more than 15% of its assets to repay the 85 billion dollars that were forwarded to him.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a majority of its businesses, beyond their life insurance at international level and their pension in the United States.
According to FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained with the AIG.
The FT continues to explain the assets of which AIG might be separated, including its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate assets and investments in the Private Equity.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, FT continues.
AIG has to make the sales at the earliest time in order to repay the over 85 billion loans that it has granted the federal reserve, also to the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of the prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the afternoon 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.88 points to 10.365.45 points.
With regard to the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had been recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final release figures, the Nasdag index, mainly regarding technology, has fallen by 199.61 points to 1.983.73 points, and the widespread index Standard &Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow some stability on the markets again, Wall Street, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter, broke up.
With 228 votes against and 205 for, the MEPs refused the funds he had requested to the Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
‘Here is a bad picture put in circulation, which represents the congress as unable to adopt a plan’, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be `too late'.
`If the project is actually convicted of failure (...), it will be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Note d. Red.) and other central banks to cope with the crisis, which would restrict the credit conditions even more,' warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed the feeling of extreme urgency even more, ‘that every day that passes, brings the ruin of a financial company’ in the United States ‘with itself’.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the US authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia's banking by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are ‘not only facing an American crisis but also a global crisis’, added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The market for basic supplies has grown sharply.
The revenues of the state bank within ten years have fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% in Friday evening, and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV duel
After the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another one followed to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats, which was to be persecuted by one third of the American families.
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance was not `brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to which Obama is at the forefront of five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
With the still undecided voters, i.e. those to whom it comes now, Obama emerged from the surveys with 39% as a winner, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-five-year-old McCain did not cease to give priority to his undisputable experience in the field of foreign policy, underlining clearly his opponent's 'naturality' on these issues, which were the centre of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama seems not to understand that...' he stressed several times.
‘I do not believe Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become President’, he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican advertising spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He spoke briefly and accurately, without getting out of the version.
He focused on his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, Obama has already,' this weekend put a democratic advertising spot against the fact that the Republicans were accused not to have captured the full extent of the crisis that the `American from the road' burdens.
‘When the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you’, Obama previewed 20,000 people yesterday who had gathered in the rain on the occasion of an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle' or 'worker'. ' The financial crisis brings Obama, which the Americans consider the most appropriate to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a crucial turning point', estimated the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's government, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' with Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final judgement of a eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After once again stressing that he would probably even be able to reduce the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully address the questions raised on the $700 billion plan to save the financial market (470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and is extremely unpopular to the people.
Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred White Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the elections on the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no outcome had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they haven't even chosen: 'What is it useful if they do with my voice what they want', says a young person.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is willing to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the non-remission of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the hostage of certain assets, could be lifted if the observers considered these elections to be clean.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting', regretted Juri Potemkin, press spokesman of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change," emphasises Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move to Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television time, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of intervening in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
For if our economy, which is heavily owed to Russia, comes into crisis and we are not reforming, we are at risk of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that the number of voters appeared too high, and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk voters) had opened the way for any kind of manipulation.
Have you noticed that an election took place?, the leader of Social Democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the election rooms.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who are most consistent with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night decreases again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Speech - The blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its establishment, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has recovered the public's confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donor service of the Canadian Red Cross were infected with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the discontent of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and developing guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to file his report, several provinces put a committee on their feet to develop a new system for the administration of blood conserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started working, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conserves and by working in this area over the next few years, we have recovered public confidence," she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced numerous cases of human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
`And we did not have the least idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we are referring to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which states that exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is apparently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than a month.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, this disease was proven to be transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of precaution that we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs) which allow to demonstrate the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests previously used.
The NST enabled the incubation time to be shortened between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing and could not be recognized has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmission of AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, this means that you need to distribute 12 million blood containers before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec is distributed between 400,000 and 500,000 blood containers each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transmitted via a blood container.
I believe that you can feel comfortable today when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe to restore your health," says the head of management of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which disease agent can get into the system.
Only last year has the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We have to keep on monitoring', Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate care in addition to a secure supply.
`The need increases because the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, with an average of only 3% of Quebec's residents suitable for blood donation.
Any healthy person who is 18 years old or older and meets the criteria can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available are not accepted because, for example, they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, and whoever has travelled to a country where malaria is widespread is excluded from blood donation for one year.
`With these 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Deficiency in stocks is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer give blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to keep them and to make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that one rarely finds time to spend an hour on blood donating," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conserves, but also human tissues, including bone transplantations, heartfelts, eye apples and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are intermediately stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public nabel cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the navel cord, which was previously considered to be biomedical waste, stem cells have rich blood that can serve to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th nail cord blood sample, and we are planning to lose more than 1,000 per year.
‘We should probably start making it available for transplantations at the beginning of next year’, says Dr. Décary, who describes this program of navel cord blood loss as very popular.
‘Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to it’, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinal
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all gates) against the Sounders from Seattle at the second and decides on the quarter final series in the Saputo stadium, in which the total gate ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the award games of the first USL League.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without a gate both for one side and for the other side, the middlefield players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Let's remember that at the first game of the pre- and backplay series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in a suburb of Seattle, had brought a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semifinal, impact will be measured with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to offset a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota with a 4 to 3 wins, but the Whitecaps moved to the semi-final round with a total gate ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev converted a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of the entire shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.'
`He was too attached to it in the first half of the time, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest set on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude opening elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's General Assembly ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today's part-election.
`The course of our last major border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis, with full follow-up to the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of painting mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mining plants, Quebec's view in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources like during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused, by the way, to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he declared that his calendar was very full.
The `Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a `Vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely a `new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has recently been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern area in the 49th degree of width - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined itself to explain why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not call date, investment sums or precise priorities for future projects.
At most some prospects for what could be worked more on: especially water energy, forest, but especially mining, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest's list, the north has `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area is twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to clearly demonstrate that he is looking for a national foundation room to realise.
Quebec has grown very much by its connection to the north, he stressed: the street to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James-Buch.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind himself.
The North, 70% of Quebec's area, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, said the Prime Minister to the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border which has not been agreed for a very long time when the opportunity is given, I will take this position again on behalf of the government', he said.
In addition, 'with climate change we have to reconsider our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the Northwest passage, which will be operating due to the ice melting all year round.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would handle them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly a Pecist MEP of Ungava) have already initiated discussions with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Resources) takes an important place, has begun its work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the plan North will be ‘discussed, regulated and environmentally sound’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this `vision' as if it was a continuation of the Liberal Prime Minister who was in office before him.
`As the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethinked to transform the challenges into new growth and development channels.
This was, by the way, one of the themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's taking over the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant into Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about the reading that has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew to determine the future," Jean Charest said.
With regard to the press, he referred to another conservative project this time, namely the programme `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Water Power Dam Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I am going to be there', he trusted his party members, which triggered those applause storms.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of making a choice this fall, which is possible for him from the law.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal Head of Party with a platform of nationalist plans, especially for "constitutional objectives", which were adopted without further delay: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the "Quebec's speciality" in the constitution.
She also wanted Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The directions of the North Plan were included by the opposition with scepticism.
The leader of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry Government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply it.
If she had done so, ‘we would have been much further today’, Ms. Marois judged Françoise Mercure at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today).
The ADQ has voted in favour of supporting the adoption by the government of a plan for the North.
‘But what we want is that this is not just a big idea’, said Sébastien Proulx in representation of Mario Dumont, who comes back from holidays today.
Letters - A Deprived Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (what irony) in the Harper Cabinet, allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that it was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a non-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that, as the only one in all the countries concerned, did not bring home its landman caught in the concentration camp of Guantanamo.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that were accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier grow under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parodie to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers advocate to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes in front of torture: it is little interested that after so many years of suffering a young adult will certainly be emotionally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently experiencing a concealable circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper keeps wearing like a flag before himself, and which sounds so disgusting from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and lock up a Canadian citizen, rightly after a head of government, who is supported by a minority until now only (if he belongs to a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party that preachs virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has dismissed the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this loosening, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwell Speech of Barrick Gold
In her issue of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an orwelly logic, that the world's largest gold winning society sought a slander against over six million authors and a small undisputed publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slander charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to drive everyone into the ruin that dares to represent one of their opposite views.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publishers of the Book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very inequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the Gold Mine.
The tactics of these inequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force an agreement that kills the opposite side and also discourages anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by knuckleback.
So it would have been enough if the Goldmine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and erases the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time and not respect the views of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice-President only includes the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very beautiful view of the concept.
In a democracy, slanders themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the Gold Mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a sneaky complaint (in the course of the `public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom to academic research and truth finding, which are fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to control debates and inconsistencies and resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what she does, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and the leading Congress Members, Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, has still to be accepted by the two congress chambers.
The main contents are: Better control by Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public funds used, new provisions to reduce the number of houses held due to payment residues, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the subsidised companies.
The American Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, the President of Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representatives of the Republicans present in the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day bargaining marathon.
‘We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-efficient’, explained Bush’s representative, Henry Paulson.
‘Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street,’ said the Democrats.
‘This is the fundamental point: if we do not, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous,’ said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, due to fear of the effect that a further failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, proved to be a supporter of the agreement, but without failing to express their discontent that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain orders for agreement, especially those that should allow the owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the senior employees of the state-saving companies.
`If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to be congratulated for.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another broadcaster whether he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing that we all have to digest, and with which we can make progress.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollars plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of the risky mortgage credits (subprime) before it extended to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally into a freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
It was a group of Republican Members who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of the societies in distress should only be secured and not purchased by the government, one believes to escape the deadlock.
In order to round the angle of view for everyone in the Congress, one has also added an order that, if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, it will then be able to collect new taxes to recover its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion, if the President considers it necessary.
The further 350 billion payment must be approved in a re-voting vote by the Congress.
In return for his assistance, Washington receives shares in the supported company that brings dividends to it in the event of profits and that can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to suspend the detention procedures relating to the dwellings bound by the real estate credits covered by this plan and to set deadlines for the repayment and cancellations paid to the senior employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Members to vote on it today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday, there were further votes against this project, both by the Republicans and the Democrats.
‘ Washington obviously doesn’t understand us,” said the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Financial Commission of the Chamber, of his electors.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to pay the cash.
The Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress, called 'the Kaucus of the Scepticists', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell us: we ask the Congress not to be under pressure and to carefully consider the way to be taken', he said yesterday.
At the same time, we again received proof in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis bank group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank BNP Paribas announced that she would refrain from buying her competitor, who has been in great difficulties since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
'This isn't lost money,' said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate for this, we have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the sparses and households appreciate, now that insecure times are promulgating.'
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank in difficulty by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion US dollars (75.5 billion) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the British Bank's branches and customer accounts.
According to North Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azur blue eyes was his drum for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor with the charming smile free himself from the narcistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity and his obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a big permanent runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he was like and for which he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his play, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of the sprinkling of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jewish and Hungarian mother.
From its European roots should be one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him was reflected a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific war, who studied play art in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he succeeded in theatre, television and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Man's second 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, even though he lived in a demonstration relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, conservative, committed and oversensitive star of the show business disappear, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the movie lovers this weekend to Taumel, while on the dark screen of memories all his major roles were played.
More than a half-century American film art in constant change moves over with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is once again in memory, and the young man who returns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is awakened at his sensitive Mr. Bridge, which at his age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of its promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, after his death again, and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
Still him.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends, who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should remain in the saddle for a long time, with Hollywood, his fortune, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the `Underplaying' when he judged his too powerful performances.
It was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to fly the roles for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fiesles or desperate people with whom he perfected his representation and reflected his revolt.
As director, Newman unveiled unknown pages of his true subtle sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence) and his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew a fine-tuning women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son to this 1984, a work full of fine feelings and sadness.
His close friend and former weaponmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said that his presence improved my life and this country.
Abundance and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's deportation, is now going there.
We've often seen him standing with his feet in shells full of vinaigrette, in sauces, biscuits or other foods, and we thought this was quite tasteless, even though we found it funny at first.
However, the profits from his transactions flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these phrases: `Everything and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actress.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Extra &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against Jáno's award and his accomplices began.
In particular, the accused is accused of participation in organised crime, as well as gross negligible damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document falsification.
According to the Attorney-General, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often subject to counterfeit bills.
State funds and grants from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly flown into the funds of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private banks of individuals.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tendering funds were used, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were counterfeit.
The billing blocks were purchased on the market by Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on the tour north of the Lake Platte, which was sent to István Lados by Jáno's surcharge.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on consumption to be able to issue invoices later based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These bills are supposed to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András Ελλάδαri, who, according to our information, should have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of Lados' "exploration tour" goals was a beer place.
As two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003, the Gastronomy company is expected to have hosted the ninety-foot group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
Now, however, the manager of the company states that such a large group would not have adapted to the premises at once.
Another invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than 10 people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to have stayed.
The fantasy of the counterfeiters was apparently not as limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not appear in the first place.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, he immediately realized that it was counterfeit documents when he was submitted by the Attorney General during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp."
And further: In addition to formal errors, the fact that the company should have hosted one hundred people was also wrong after they had a total of eleven rooms that could not offer so many people space.
Also had been mentioned on the bill of food, the restaurant had been out of operation for a long time.
The current counterfeiters have also refused to verify that the Budapest travel agency taken by them offers travel abroad exclusively, so they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As has been known during the investigations, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
In total, the amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company charged only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and only machine invoices were issued by employees, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been subordinated to the "computer" was that in a case they had indicated "frequency transport", although this was not offered by the investment consulting company, the Attorney General informed.
Further form errors - false billing format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were revealed as counterfeiting.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sport camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors paid charge of never issuing the invoices.
Another "false" has been subdued to the falsifiers at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was at the time of (2001) in a resolution just when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület should have eaten there - the mass administrator thus declared that the invoices were not issued by himself.
Consciently fake
The other group of accountants are persons who were fully aware that they had to lay fictive bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the indictment, the director of the Collob Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictive invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is also currently in liquidation, is also expected to have worked with surcharge and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH has provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlase Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület Associations with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to non-provided services.
However, there was equally little payment, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the interested parties have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants comprises persons directly linked to the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postbote of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices on the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. in liquidation from Kiskunhalas has acted as the buyer of these invoices since 14 September 2005.
The company's CEO was a Romanian, to which the company documents should also be submitted by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has issued invoices on behalf of GmbH to the Atlasz and Hopá associations, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and has collected their value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which was alleged to be the result of a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szene, who was responsible for preparing the company's foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the surcharge, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The Attorney General assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the total of the accounts and VAT each.
Kubatov even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issue of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were settled with the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts were not intended to be used.
To hide this, they presented five fictional bills of the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
These invoices were also secured when searching the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some accused are now counting on an acknowledgement of the method of counterfeiting, as they have already been made before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main defendant, Jáno, decides to give a comprehensive confession.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report comprehensively on everything, his confession still stands.
So the question remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of HUF's damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether an increase in return is ready to assume responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the "insulted" will now play the "insulted" after his attempts to mitigate the detention and home arrest had been encountered on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have caused much greater damage to economic offences and have not paid compensation, are on their own foot, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of overflowing - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the bidder.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lottery while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the overflow of the opponent plays an important role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore argued that the price increase could be explained by avoiding a overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, economists in the research group have also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should be involved against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, and then they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward in case they emerged as winners of the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis was on the one on the profit, the other was on the loss.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologues, the members of the "game against losing" group were prepared to make a higher stake than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results can be derived from no previous economic theory.
These have, in fact, only motivated the behaviour observed at auctions with the joy of gaining, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the visual neurological processes, so we have now a third statement prepared" - Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economic Faculty at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be consulted?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated to be a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowishness are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogens, hepatitis viruses are spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, secrecy or spice).
Travellers are recommended to vaccinate against viruses A and B in any case, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show approximately two-three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and fracture.
Afterwards the yellowing occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the healing can take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, around 1 million people die each year of the much more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth of the infected is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the pathogen destroys the liver cells intuitively - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who were subjected to blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
At the right time, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th, the World Day of Hepatitis, was held for the first time by patient representations worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their formation and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show, religious faith acts like a kind of "painful agent" that should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent faith in God influences the feeling of human pain, reported the British paper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre study, each 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Through a brain scan technology, it has even been demonstrated that the Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which philosophers and theologists from various departments of the university also participated in the research project.
In the trial, a sparkling device was connected to the left hand to the subjects, which gave the electro shocks.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: On the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the believers would create a kind of religious trance while selecting Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as calming.
The subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during that time, while they should either look at the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that when they looked at God's Mother, they felt "in security" as if they were "cared" and they felt "rest and peace".
While viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, said that one could also produce similar effects with other, highly active images also among the atheists, just to find the appropriate photo.
"We need to find a picture that causes very positive feelings like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and does it in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image Leonardos or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you tell about yourself
On her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it is found in people's pockets as well as about their heads in the sky: she knows where the people spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what they move.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
In the direction of scepticists who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he lets it be directed: these would just ignore the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus get closer to the company's original goal of "all information on this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still at the beginning of the information gathering.
Asked after the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google could answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs were not yet able to do so because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses that were sought from, and the pages visited.
For example, the "personalized search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save its own search course and later to use it, so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and based on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" that the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, the users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which is awesome, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or the desire against power that many Internet users are opposed to.
However, it is proven that the search terms are not only stored, but also transferred to third parties, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was the response to paedophilia in Brazil recently, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of paedophilia.
However, in May, users concerned with personal rights were able to breathe when Google, together with the civil rights organisation, successfully brought the FBI to court: so Google can be forced to publish information to the FBI on a secret request, even in the future with no point in the Constitution.
(However, the federal government has successfully produced the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms in reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list backwards to two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who don't like to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google's services, the company is reluctant to resent the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which thanks to Windows is the market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users identification codes in contrast to Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program pack seem to be much more attractive, younger and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks perceive the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet messerscharf - a relationship that has been focused, particularly in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is nothing but collaboration, say, the users deliberately leave tracks and benefit from the available communications channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can manage its profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, via other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are osteated on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is dismissed because in his blog he is just too honest about his concern about corporate management - one is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever lives an online life is what he praises of himself - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to deal with the Google monopoly, can like to do this - like Scroogle, a tool that can access Google's search engine, but willingly leaves no traces.
Not only do few people deliberately register on community pages so that they are not found, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
However, public opinion waits for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly faster introduced services not only provide Microsoft, but also other software developers with headaches.
Critical viewers, however, also find the worrying counterparts: For example, the management of the Group has completely rejected a protest by employees after the fees of the company's kindergarten were doubled, as well as the management said that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive. But all of this is all too mild to say that Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed to an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those who violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be requested in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could again severely alter: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project now assumes that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in the best orwell way a future in which a person becomes scaryly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help the double killer of Ózd to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped with the removal of traces, said the speaker of the Borsod police commission on Tuesday.
The young people were stable and are currently accused of the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it's two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a sentence of up to five years of freedom.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion that he has deliberately murdered several people from money greed.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a higher amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he attracted his creditor to an area in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned a long-handed act - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murders with a gun hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police now investigate the crime weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
About EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, but they want to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech newspaper "E15", the offer of Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far presented offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, a number of leading European leaves already spoke of "September 11".
The global financial disaster we owe to the American President, said "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to find his own party for the bill behind himself, which should bring some relief to the fearful situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be better to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also found the sinbock in Washington.
According to the El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is the fault that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in the Congress, there is a risk that Washington has no political means to manage crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the biggest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "days advertiser".
Although some countries could still provide rescue packages to their money institutions that have become in trouble, banks could save the money of taxpayers from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there is no need for more banks, then no further financial injections or other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States should jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to shy financial institutions, recalls Vienna's "Standard". Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns that the Americans now also need to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis are increasingly realistic.
To date, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is now like a tsunami across the old continents.
While the "saving" would not have to "save" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to see in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the barrier sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln in creating new systems to prevent accidents.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C-type biomimetic system controlled by authoroboters, a mini car equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collision.
On the flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180-degree face field within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to Board, which immediately launches the anti-collision process.
The obstacle is recorded in second break parts, and the authoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the appropriate angle.
Contrary to previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively.
"If not, the authorobot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authoroboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innerst and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is currently considered inevitable within the accident.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that must happen in the fraction of a second.
However, the evasion, unlike the bees, can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only towards the turnability of the tyres.
While the bees here are infinitely open to avoid other bees, the researchers at the authoroboter could only use the rotational movement, or the acceleration and brake.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it is important to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store them.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not need to store it, or by using previous manoeuvres, to produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so it is constantly using only a handful of KB Memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate anti-collision technology, which, according to Nissan's assessment, will be in production in the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously guiding the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion heavy rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and is aimed at buying the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, the congress delegates, after several days' debates, reached an agreement on the 700 billion dollars heavy rescue package, said Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House of Deputies, and said that the agreement had only to be documented.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
As a result, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: the programme will show effectiveness and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, it wasn't about saving Wall Street, it was about breaking the tragedy of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, Washington time Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Media European time Monday at 2 p.m.), but has not triggered an altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Deputies first vote on the 2008 bill on economic stabilization, then the Senate is on its way.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be issued at once for the purchase of lesser securities charged with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This amount is to be used for the purchase of credited, bad securities, and the President is to decide on the other 100 billion USD.
The programme is reviewed by a separate Commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time purchase poor loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the responsible persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or to avoid a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, Paulson says.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their executions, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang, to be reduced by the government.
A reduction in wages will only occur in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the department buys in an auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the paid bank manager is withdrawn to the pension.
In the event of direct purchase of the cowardly lending, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that managers' salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake treaties are not being amended - the limitations relate only to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State is gaining participation rights in participating banks, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank are recovering.
The bill provides that the President will have to submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how the taxpayers will recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were scepticists on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not at all protect the taxpayers' money, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were promoted by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistics Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared with August 2007 by 12.9 per cent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year's prices.
Due to changes in domestic and export prices, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 per cent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices were only slightly higher than the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also risen little - 0.1 per cent - since July.
The largest price rise in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 per cent) - mainly for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 per cent, and for shoes prices rose by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials pushed prices for chemicals and productions significantly (1.6 per cent).
A decrease in prices was recorded in raw oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent), and in timber processing (0.1 per cent).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, price increases were measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
In view of the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 per cent).
In the metal manufacturing sector, an increase of 13.2% was observed, while the increase in food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 per cent.
Price decline was observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 per cent).
The level of tarification in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
In total, prices in manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2% last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water increased by 18.7 per cent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic market, the highest price increase (0.7 per cent) was recorded in the investment sector in August.
In the production sectors of consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and further processing sectors they remained the same as in the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sectors (16.8%) compared to the 2007 comparison period.
In the consumer goods sector, prices increased by 6.8 per cent, and prices decreased by 1.4 per cent.
Export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but in the year-on-year comparison there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent.
The domestic currency became 1.7 per cent lower than the euro, the dollar was 7.1% weaker, and compared to the price of August 2007, it was stronger than the euro by 7.5 per cent, even by 15.9 per cent.
No more visa to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the American-Hungarian Visumab coming will enter into force around the 12th century, as the Foreign Ministers explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "it is all that depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced in time in the overseas countries."
However, it also stressed that the new system will not provide an entry permit, but that tourists should register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is negotiating in Washington from now on.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over the "Mittlere Verdienst Kreuz mit Stern" of the Republic of Hungary, and also holds discussions with the foreign policy consultants of Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, promised their support for the $700 billion heavy rescue package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After days of Marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the Congress and government representatives announced that they reached agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the break-up of the frozen credit market, became a key issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its advancement thanks to the economic themes, while McCain Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was at the same time fused.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly adopt the bill of the 700 billion dollar heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also included those aspects of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened," he said before 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete".
In an interview given to the broadcaster ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have a lot of trouble (...) but nothing is definitely an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also required the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the executions for top managers - something he insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that the House of Deputies would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking space
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more self-conscious within the camp - so "The mirror" commented on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-handed German news magazine Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys her fathers".
According to the renowned politician, CSU's erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the breaking of the era is a problem of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The CSU's disaster was not surprising, but on Sunday something ended, however, which was already quite exact ten years ago: the doubtless hegemony of a state party
For already ten years ago, 1998 the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty percent mark
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Federal Day Elections, i.e. in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization carried out consistently by the CSU in the Federal Republic of Germany has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at a considerable pace, but without impact, the secularization, the educational success, the entry of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain in the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more self-sufficient.
It is noticeable that in the last few weeks, the classical civic groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with academia such as university degrees.
Here the CSU's support fell to even less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders reluctant in coalition issues" articles on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the re-elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the involvement of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is turning around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders were hardly looking into their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reaffirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very well possible - in some Länder and in the social partners, this is already the case.
Faymann was open to the question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current CEO of the ÖVP as Vice Chancellor.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the bowl-molterer course.
It would not be possible to repeat this direction.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann attempts to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which is currently directed by the French Presidency of the European Union.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz member of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to education segregation, since it is one of the most serious violations of the law that the Roma children face, and this is also the biggest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Fidesz Press Office, Járóka pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be banned from the labour market because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can obtain a university degree."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education was a fundamental human right that would play a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the opinion of Members, it is important that this context become aware of a widest possible circle - Roma and non-Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be completed" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, target-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disegregation in the education sector, which requires correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the devil circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a full-righteous citizen," Járóka said.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit is organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also at national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debacel, there are no heads at once, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were delayed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the Tandem after the disastrous 17 percent loss of vote will be decided on on the extraordinary party day on the last October week.
However, the much-coloured duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their chairs.
They want to calm down the annoyed group and the party base that one day after the "Bayer Tsunami" demanded personal consequences, given the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stiober at his career height - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stiober they could secure only 44.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "Allregisseur" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state that is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of party-internal restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads exploration talks with the liberal FDP or the right-wing "free voters" on a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of destiny comes as if with the list of "free voters" those Gabriele Pauli came into the legislature whose anti-stoiber appearance used the Huber-Beckstein Duo first to serve the goalful politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU President called on 28 September the "deepest day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - he believes that the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a great deal to success at national level in 2005, is not put back on the ground with a common power act, Merkel cannot become a Chancellor after the Federal Day elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has been disappointed by the fiasco, believes that the land loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6%, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
During the elections on Sunday, no MP of the Opposition managed to enter the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is a matter of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects legal irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
De Legislature of the 10 million resident state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposite party gathered under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) has seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "renew its presidential mandate for the fourth time" this time, would allow some members of the opposition in Parliament.
Therefore the ODS has even removed the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on the rise in prices of natural gas imports from Russia. Loans have even been borrowed for the reduction of price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the context of the opposition's expectations, Ukraine was hoped to improve its relationship with the EU, since Lukashenko and other high-level politicians have been banned from entering the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
For a temporary relaxation, the OECD election evaluation report, in which the emphasis was rather on the positive movements than on the deficiencies - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign on Monday - which is why oppositionists should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been put freely, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse the recognition of the independence of the abyssly Georgian provinces of South-Osetia and Abchasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on the paper, has been regarded as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevitsch on our paper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the mighty have been afraid to let only one opponent in parliament".
The opposition does not intend to protest against the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of the distribution of stones, but yet I see that more and more people support change, even the elderly" - said Milinkewitsch, suggesting that even the most supported pensioners' shift is not in agreement with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time until the "social security" reminding the silence of a cemetery begins," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe in the acts, not the words." The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now breakfast is cooked before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
From now on, the measure will come into force against those slurries that first stamp down and then go coffee drinks during the working time.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
">"Rable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher presence rates and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta reiterates.
With the Chigi Palazzo, the establishment ends in all the structures of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says, "the choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, so there is no more breakfast during the working time; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino works miracles at 7 a.m.".
During a meeting of the High Committee on Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
from Rome, the Minister declares that "in three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people are present in work per year".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"These wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have in the last 8-10 years doubled the size of the private sector and far above inflation."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have gathered together to counteract the Brunetta Decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with numbers of less abstractions at work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of 'active fauls' grow continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to declare war on the unlawful standards of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory home arrest of the sick worker, during which check visits can be made and other aspects of the minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2500 work accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain invalid.
For 2007 the data of the Inail ( Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were approximately 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as those caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work in order to bring the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the support of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion.
"An enraged "Basta" has raised itself on this; understandably, in the case of tragedies that, according to their size, trigger some spindles in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is at least a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of the educational environment by young people who feed the labour market are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not distract from its social seriousness. We need to put in force and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and obliges all institutions to work on determined rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of deaths due to work is far too high," stresses Anmil's president, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that one is basically not doing enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against them through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already in school."
"An additional effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness raising of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility is required by employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency."
Mercandelli also mentioned "the progressive worsening of the protection of the victims of accidents at work" and advocated "the abolition of the social system we have fought against in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employee a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations which are decided by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 Player under charge: Risk of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report which is widely disseminated in Brussels today, cite the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
"The report – as it says in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable music for at least five years a week longer than an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume will harm their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – as the European Union says – show a clear risk that urges to act too quickly.
What really matters is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information common.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the Independent Scientific Committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - the EU Communication concludes - confirm that we are rightly concerned and that the European Commission will now, together with the other European Members and stakeholders, examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from noise from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could be caused by excessive noise.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the sound setting can be used.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that when users of portable music devices listen only five hours a week to music (right as 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded, as regards the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, we're going to have a balance in June.
This is the procedure set out by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome, which took place this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermals.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - Alemanno said. "The Commission will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains the municipal and municipal council.
There is no redistribution of competences, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve, as such a project must have a time-limited endpoint.
In June - as the mayor announced - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence, because their opinion is lacking in debt, will answer Alemanno: "All depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, she delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then her contribution will be fundamental.
Too often policy is concerned with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in mind to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The Mayor of Rome places great emphasis on clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think. It will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to own a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to jump in quality - which it really needs - and thus to make a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which will "restrict itself not only in the current local borders but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much about being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated by his decisions, the economy of the United States and had relations with the enemy Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more violent, right now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheerful: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
But in fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great advance.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the election hall will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which was kept hidden until the last time.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll decide for whom we'll make our crows, whether for Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its traces to journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "mörder" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on their situation and mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information about the controllers.
You don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the reductions in the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from significantly shrinking.
A clear but complex pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors in the press believe that journalism at national level is in the wrong direction.
In the local area, the executives are even 65 per cent.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction of the web.
The most important publishing groups run the way into the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology in the hope that "it brings something good for journalism".
The biggest break is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the journalists who work for them.
56 % of editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while they are only 23 % at local level.
Some think it has to do with "security at work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "redacteurs", note d. Red.) is always a topical topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer as popular as they are and so it will be a question of taking it or leaving it.
The chief editors often receive very high wages, while the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros per month, with pension and insurance funds.
As far as holidays are concerned, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But, as they admit themselves, American journalists will often be "sick" over the course of the year.
It's a question of the climate.
UNIPOL: ROOM COURT: DANILO COPPOLA BLEEPS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate broker, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bank red in the context of the Counter-Agreement Investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his resignation from the house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate broker to be moved from the province city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (which the Attorney General had spoken against) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and bring evidence to him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago when the House of Deputies voted against the $700 billion savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the course of the Republican party, which is becoming more and more divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to them in Washington and the financial world and, inter alia, win voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party is due to its rise, for example, to the voice of the party I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or is already: not only in the United States, also throughout the West and perhaps beyond it will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-lasting feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery of the state's unprecedented renaissance in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links with abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of households living in a single State.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to act towards the families concerned, which are also a huge electoral mass.
The crisis therefore appears economically global, and politically, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen away from itself and lost its right to speak: the EU's instructive evidence of this has been given, which, due to its division in different national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of his own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, inter alia, distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became increasingly serious, only the United States is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that are not overvaluable – in certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to resort in a similar way.
This new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is, by the way, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that has recently been linked in the economy to a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, right now that we were so convinced that we had long gone into a networked global empire, into a empire of ever-differentiated technologies, the immaterial, that we need to see at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of these can be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another person living in an invincible, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second new one, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Whoever territory, whoever government, who says politics, says Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for prestigious leadershipships, so the need for someone who knows how to deal with things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing guides, e.g. those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and in some sense annoying aspect: a loss of confidence, independence, an image of inappropriateness, a feeling of distance, which all focuses on a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems thus to be the belief that in large parts of the population it is not only the acts of the social elite, but also their ideas world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority as ever more alien and superior.
The demand for Leadership thus underground is a branched but powerful movement of the deception of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unexpected "revolt" of the voters and in the unexpected revolt of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, the revolt of the American parliamentarians against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, its parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value for what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is further strengthened from the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open is certainly not.
The super collar that lets up on walls
The forces of gravity to defeat thanks to a glue and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is apparently almost at the target.
With a adhesive placed on a surface of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, using a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and sleeve paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the ability to hold the foot of the reptiles and at the same time "can easily remove from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as an essential adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Maybe, but the researchers think of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could be part of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that cleanse itself from dust by moving like hair on a surface itself and thus always preserves perfect liability.
Medicines: never take fruit juice
Careful for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, may cause serious health damage when they are taken together with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on their absorption by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he reiterated his alarm: A glass of orange, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the ability to take certain vital medicines to ensure that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN CHARACTERISTICS – The same agency of the medicinal product had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture two years ago, and stressed to watch out what is drinking in combination with medicines such as diazepane or metadon.
IT IS NOT GREAT FRUIT – according to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal made by Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers, which are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are any doubts, to ask a pharmacy or a doctor," the expert from the Ansa Agency stresses.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The economic Nobel Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the Bush Administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had argued in a key article of the New York Times that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prediction that received not little polemics as a response and was kept to the economist even years later, but today proves to be absolutely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals disappeared from the public view field in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style, which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the audience with some new features: in addition to a revised and now Spartaner-designed start menu, one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is finally reached, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
Aware against was also the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, e.g. facilitating sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files in graphic editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
So you can also generate "hybride" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: Tables can now be processed by different users in multiple hands, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a chart to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result is to be published.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, if free of charge is an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: in the end, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a training offer, which is an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at the removal of Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of more famous access; and lastly Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – an objective that can be easily exceeded by already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Coal also positively tested and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case mi frame of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is third-class and winner of the tricot of the best climber.
The message published the newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the third generation ep. Previously, this happened with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as with the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohls are ones that have been carried out in the last few weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the countersamples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and informant, according to the Associated Press, also the Austrian experts.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for himself.
Theme IMPLEMENTATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAYS: Is ITALY RASISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with opposition.
Do this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is asked by the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy, which comes out of the case of the young, Burkina Faso-run Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case shows what the Times call "North Paradox": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is seen".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times appeals to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants introduced by Lega is also referred to as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President of the State also emphasise: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euro per room high rental prices
The student housing market does not know any crises.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples and 600 euros in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already accepted very serious trains. A whole series of students lose their right to study so effectively, because their families are unable to support them at this level" – says Sunia's responsible, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the great demand of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, lack of registrations, no lease limit, unauthorized sublocations.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which lead to lower lease prices by reviewing taxation.
When looking at the investigation, it turns out that a sleeping place in the Brianza quarter is needed in Milan; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera quarter or even 900 euros in the Vittoria quarter.
In Florence, an average sleeping area costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the neighborhoods around the university, are 250/280 euros for a bed of need, 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters around the university are about 600 euro for a single room, 450 euro for a double room.
The rentals in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome are less deeper: 550 euros in Eastern and Cinecittà.
Only those who go outside can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping area and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vosero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350 euros.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they are more important in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomalie: a rental of 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multisalle complexs in the periphery, in the long term means death for the singlesale cinema in the centre. A process that does not only seem inevitable and irrevocable, but also bear the trains of a cultural crime.
Most of them are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with which you've done a piece of road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which 20 years ago brought him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes. It's the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-for-ever lost cinema world.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this book largely paid the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main guilty are the multiplex cinemas, because it is just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years the Lombardy has put on the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures are also created, but first of all, the preservation of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all of his parent customers are willing to visit instead of the old multiplex cinema in the periphery.
And here is the lack of budget for the trade union fund: the debt burden recorded by the state is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame of the ethical-moral view that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinema halls, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax concessions for cinema operators and benefits for the public in relation to transport: it will be possible to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the centre and to park at more affordable parking charges.
"It's a joyful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join us and develop new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to counter the superpower of the multiplex halls, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of the traditional cinema has always been an important subject for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to set up the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass at the Rialto or the Quirinal in the Via Nazional, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid having to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and Nrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations made by the law firm of the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his alternate Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation amount of 10 million euros for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm disrespecting," the lawyers write, "the two local authorities had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"So the mafia group had been made possible – according to the judges – to enter the council halls in an official way and to agree on public administration policy."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "all other than an exception to encounter connections from local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Nrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the police of the Clan Piromalli were dismantled.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even at that time due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians of their municipal offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the middle-right coalition after the May 2006 election.
He cried scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He drew attention to the Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he ordered to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons. However, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, the judges declared that the Piromalli-Clan had even dared to apply for a change to the A3 project.
From an audition in connection with the investigation of the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-sweeping source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems to understand this to the great energy companies in the world.
Wells, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and also looking for opacity, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not randomly, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke in 1980, the idea of marine energy was gasped, but now the environmental organisations and the rise in oil prices are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
The currents and tides would also be added.
Giant at the attack.
The first company now relying on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are more and more companies from the traditional energy industry who are relying on marine energy generation.
"Chevron is studying these technologies" – according to the speaker of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and considering the possibility of working with us."
This is about the acquisition of an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project in front of Alaska's coast.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, i.e. when you consider that oil continues to be promoted by the US in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are also unknown, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Technologies that can be further improved.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in the process of breaking up, not least because the last doubts are not cleared by the environmentalists.
To date, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment need.
There are different ways: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected bends, for example.
The sliding of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers via pistons and cylinders.
This one drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a merchandise store and a park latz using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator as a result of the rotating movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electrical Production Research, special interest deserves at present the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind flows, sunlight and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tide energy that has led states like New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest already $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million is already planned for 2009.
