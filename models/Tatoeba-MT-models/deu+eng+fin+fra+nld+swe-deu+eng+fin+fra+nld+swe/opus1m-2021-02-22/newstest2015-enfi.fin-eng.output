Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the Eastern Ukraine separatists.
This moment Kiev's leadership does not want to engage in an essential political debate with its eastern part of the country, said Putin, according to Itar-Tassi.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiev and the West say they are assisted by the Russian army, were trying to push the U.K. troops away from their moments where Putin said that the U.K. military forces were shooting civilians.
The aim of militia fighters is to push these armed forces and their missiles away so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Fridays and Saturdays at the Ryrmi repair house.
It surprised the people came right from the beginning of the night.
There were visitors in two days expected, says Promotor Tom Kangas.
The Wall River Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hiphop festivals, i.e. dolls aren't allowed, Kangas convinces.
Finland enters into force on Tuesday, a law restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply for authorisation from the Police Board to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitrometane, nitric acid, potassium chloride, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the specified concentrations are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen nitrogen is present in cleaning and washing materials, but their concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethan is used, for example, in the acceleration drive.
However, raw materials obtained prior to the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Choice: Super Raheem shine - Mario stayed in the shadow - Choice - Night Messages
Only 19 years old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he was considered to be the hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere when the Liverpool, a fortified by Mario Balotel, arrived at Tottenham.
Super Mario’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw an Italian 24 - year - old work in the field with a different attitude than Manchester City.
The Balotel was still far from its peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality finishing places and only put half of his sixteen feeds to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already been popular with the player will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotel in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the second attacker of the team next to Daniel Sturridge.
As a star of the team, instead of Balotel, the head of the middle-field diamond Raheem Sterling was sparked by Hugo Lloris in a 3-0-winning opening painting.
Sterling, 19, it's not just good to work.
The English is 20 cents shorter than the Balotel is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common to a player who has the highest speed of about 34 km per hour on the lawn.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irelander told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the growing northwest of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the chief master of Helsinki City Orchestra, "I'm happy and proud."
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki City Orchestra as the next master of the city since autumn 2016.
The magazines of the Los Angeles Times have asked what orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki tells me she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country’s music life for over a hundred years, including by presenting a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestra has led the best Finnish chapel masters and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm," he says.

The organisations have promised the job solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate it would be created during this week.
Oh, my God.
The Rovaniemen women's football team Woman Volley tripped with the Vampulan athletes at the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
The vampire turned to five of the 3-2 winners of a boated match.
The last batch WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was a step ahead of it all the time.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Theemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVon's cube was ritual to the point that a 190-century American pilot Jennifer Keddy was back stuck on the side.
As a senter, Sara Niemi played.
Karolina Kyllönen was playful in spite of his thumb injury and formed the most powerful combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarise.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make space for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 batch.
The best part of Vampula was a skilled Russian pastor and libero Hillaelina Spinner, which WoVo was running as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinnan HPK arrives at Rovaniemi training camp.
The team meets on Saturday at the "deal" at 18:00 at the official training game.
On Sunday, we will meet at the Sports University again.

The company published its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that for the last financial year it paid almost EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Memberl group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarial cancer dies more often due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment in few populated areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video to honor her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women in rural areas are more likely to die of ovarian cancer than those in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1100 Australian women receiving ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005, and found that only 35% of women, i.e. more than five years after diagnosis.
Senior researcher Susan Jordan QIMR of the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in few and far-reaching areas died more likely during the research than women living in urban areas.
PIENI RESEARCH: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, past diseases and socio-economic status also affected the survival potential.
In older women and when cancer was spread to a wider extent during the diagnosis, the probability of survival was the smallest.
Women living in few and far-reaching areas were more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside towns are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers that there are possible causes of delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly in large cities," Jordan says.
Although remote treatments are becoming more widespread and the importance of distance decreases, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors in order to enable specialists to treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support remotely treated patients.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival percentage of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, which stresses the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the 33-year-old mother of the family, Elisha Neave, who lived on Gold Coast, was found to be malicious ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the stationary chart of the bucket parking in the Friendliness Park, which is located next to the Hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposal for a position plan for the Friendship Park and its nearby environment would be set to the publicly visible service point in Osvit.
Opinions are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
By means of a change in the position plan, the city wants to allow for the continuation of the tourism-related motor rolling activities in the area.
The site is intended to form a park area that contains the existing Friendship Park and its area with the river.
During the period from 15 November to 30 April, no more than 200 motorcycles will be permanently available on the site.
In the area, tanking points may also be invested in the specified part.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area for safari companies for motor rolling in winter.
The lease agreement has been renewed last spring 2014 and the agreement is in force until spring 2018.
Cockpit parking and formula change have also raised strong resistance.
The residents of the neighboring layer houses have been close both to vote and to concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been investigated and there have been no findings that exceed the indicative values.
The new equipment is even older than low-emission.
The friendly park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further, safari customers in the hotel should be transported to the departure points of the safari by buses, which would be estimated at 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of the Friendship Park and its surroundings are also sufficiently wide, better than the places presented as substitutes, such as the visit to the east of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The Friendship Park is good for its location, even because the activities in the future can be extended, for example, to the Ounaspaviliong area.
The establishment of car parks is part of the urban strategy adopted by Rovaniemi City Council, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business by providing adequately high-quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for the motor rolling stock in the centre, which has not yet received legal power.
Decrease of property properties can be seen in garden stores
The reduction in the number of housing owners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions when today's young consumers reach their ages of garden shop “the main target group”. Financial Times reported on the study by the British Garden Trade Association (Horticultural Trades Association, HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, housing tenants spend only 55% of the amount used by housing owners in garden management.
The study also showed that more and more people live in highly urban apartments with no gardens, and that the size of the garden is reduced when the foreground is more and more covered as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated to be approximately GBP 5 billion per year.
In the London area, housing ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, and there the least money is spent on garden products per household throughout the country.
However, according to HTA and the United Kingdom Garden Association (RHS), the increase in the rental of dwellings or the decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The leading garden drivers of RHS, Guy Barter, says that "for example, plants in transferable breeding containers are particularly popular among tenants, because such breeding containers can be included in the change if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the flowering period in the garden sector, as the ownership and wealth of dwellings increased from the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that the trade will increase this year thanks to better weather conditions, since the weather in March and April last year has been worse.
Turkey interviews the U.S. diplomat for a report on spying
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on an American and British espionage report in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the United States Embassy Officer and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German Der Spiegel magazine and the Internet magazine The Intercept have written that the documents published by the former analyst Edward Snowden of the United States National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy destination of the United States and the United Kingdom intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report, saying that all the major states have spyed each other.
The previous report on the spying against Ankara by the German Central Intelligence Service has led to a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, present in several success stories, has been attached to the female main part of the new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights in the morning, whose descriptions start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the best women's award for the Cannes film festival for his role in the film Barbarie invasion in 2003.
He has performed in the film of Steven Spielberg in Munich and in the film of Julian Schnabel in Perhone's glass.
Two nights in the morning film's man's main part is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be released in Finland's first night in September 2015.
Majorca Magaluf Police Officer accused of corruption
The report submitted evidence of the extortion by the police and the City of Calvià officials at the Majorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvià, located on the island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of the corruption accusations made by the movements and barkeepers in the Magaluf area for having been celebrated in humidity.
Colonel José Antonio Navarro was put in custody after several commercial owners of the Red Ballena street made charges of corruption against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diarion, the evidence of the case provided evidence of the extortion by police and Calvià City Board officials at the Office of the Majorca Anti-Corruption Attorney on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police in connection with corruption charges, and they are being interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
ABC, a country -wide newspaper, wrote about the neutrality of the angry authorities of the nightclub owners, which made their business a lot more difficult.
"There is no longer money in the matter, but survival," said a business owner to the court.
You won't destroy our business.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the titles of the magazines this summer, when a online YouTube video was broadcast by a 18-year-old British vacationer who had sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to control the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf tourists by reducing the number of notorious alcoholic pub crawlers.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organiser of the pub crawl Carnage were ordered to pay a fine of EUR 55 000.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular destination of Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called balconying trend, which has caused a number of accidents due to alcohol use when people have jumped from balcony to balcony to hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after having spent the summer in bombers, when rockets and granates bombed their communities in the 50-day war of Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed during the recovery of the region.
The opening of schools caused joy and tension in missile bombing in the communities of southern Israel, but the traces of battles are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod, in Pashosh, workers removed traces of chips from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket hit into the day care.
"We're a little scared, but we're also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in the Saad kibbuts, the Israeli municipality, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area need ruths.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart thinks she'll be back to school for a long time after she feels a little weird.
"We have had some difficult times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts near the Gaza border.
Before the beginning of the fire break last week, thousands of Saad border communities had remained indoors or left homes to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape from the fire of rockets and granates.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza border are suspicious about the return of the Palestinian granate after the death of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, the fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was subject to heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be provided".
Israel and Hamas agreed on the current ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas's demand for the removal of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of the Gaza air and seas.
Israel wants to remove Hamas's weapons and return the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen during wars.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died during the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although they had no substantial evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including Thai workers, died.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 missiles and granates in most Israeli cities in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and approximately 250,000 people fled to shelter to over 100 United Nations schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While ten thousand people were still in shelter and while fighting continued, the school authorities moved from the beginning of the school the previous week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said the 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in shelter in the city of Gaza.
According to the most commonly used meter, the prices of dwellings have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing, measuring the prices of homes in Australia's capital city, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP data on Monday.
As a result, prices increased by 4.2 per cent during the summer, July and August period, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding the year 2013, but prices have not risen consistently throughout the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
RP Data results show that housing prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% and Melbourne by 11.7% in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adela, Brisbane and Darwin are next the most vibrant; the average price rise is five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring started in Australia to increase the number of dwellings in sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"Bearing in mind the increase in sales of auctioned dwellings, the overall high sales rate and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that the increase in housing prices will continue in the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänta
The new museum and art have attracted record audiences this summer to Mäntä.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Museum of Art.
The new Gösta museum was opened in June and has been presented with classical pop art works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mäntti’s Art Weeks again told me on Monday that he had made a visitor record when the Momenten event had visited 14,500 interested people this summer.
These figures have not been used.
The people have laid down the doors and windows," says Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors throughout the year will come to Serlachius museums this year to approximate hundred thousand.
In previous years there have been about 40,000 visitors.
In the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, there are about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum director Sivonen reminds us that the new museums are always open when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the period of art will continue long over the summer.
In autumn, the art museum opens new exhibitions.
The police are investigating the last four days in Kajaan.
On Sunday night on the North Channel, the business property was broken by breaking a window.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday, deep-rooted roads had been stolen fuel from the truck tank.
Once again, between Sunday and Monday, a boat and its trailer engines had been taken from the petennisa port.
The rowing boat was Kalapalta-marked out of light and inside yellowish.
In the inner bar, the text "OVA" was read on the bottom.
A couple of suspects of stealing the police have already got caught.
On Sunday night on the Tikkapurontie, there was a break into the business property.
The police dog got a trace, and a 20-year-old palamo man was found in the forest in hiding under the six.
On Monday, the police caught another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected to be guilty of the same burglary.
The missing amphetamine brought a murder accusation in Kajaan.
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamine brought a murder accusation to a Kayanian man born in 1977.
According to the Attorney, the man had gone to a house with his husband and his husband and shot with a shotgun the house owner, a 34-year-old Kayan woman, suspected of being an exporter of drugs.
The defendant contested the charge and claimed the other man involved as a shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when the police team stopped a passenger car with a company burning the clothes used in the bloodwork.
In addition to the burned vasculars, there was a broken gun in the car.
The Court of Justice of Kainu will issue a judgment later.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the Air Science Institute, August is as warm as it is on average once in ten years.
The statistics of the Air Science Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In the majority of the country the deviation was from one to two degrees.
As a result of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
During the first week of August, the highest temperature of the summer was measured in Por, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, my father never embraced me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in 1958 in Dudley, a family of settlers from seven children from Jamaica.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary discussion with his father and is developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
Sound sick is a mix of reggae and rappie in upbeat.
Henry's had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he is thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very hard to read.
He never saw his face, just a voice said, "Stop noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with his father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer or the beauty of a cristal.
I never talked to him about things like that.
Most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner of me, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened the metal smelt shop in Dudley, and thus got an idea of how his father’s life must have been, although working conditions are now better than at that time.
Nowadays, the smelters are slightly brighter, but they are practically dark, smokeful, labyrinthous depths, where flames, smoke and steep smelts are smelting, and that bring into mind the cereal.
The father used to go to a bath and just go to bed in a bath, and quietly he began to sing himself when washing the dirt from the smelthouse.
When I walked around the smelthouse, I realized that he had been doing it for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness offered by parents.
My father never embraced and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we began to repeat that we loved each other.
Henry has daughter Billie with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love that she was missing from herself as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you all the time"?
Don't fuck with me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn with French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why aren't Dawn and I friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one reason that led to mother's death.
When I started suffering from overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I started doing a lot of exercises, and I also had to start a tough diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may picture his change during career development.
After having received a lot of good feedback from critics on their role as Othello, he has fallen into the theater.
The next was the Errors' comedy and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Doing a theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedys Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry only started his business when he was 16 years old.
He was noticed on stage by an imitator and contacted the New Faces Competitiveness Competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "How long was I the only black imitator and comic on TV," he says.
Henry learned work when he was doing it.
I was supposed to grow up in the light of publicity, I had to learn to produce jokes from a slider between 1975 and 1985, while living starness and I was on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had scenic rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared black-made, so Henry ended up in a comic program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I regret it.
Although my position was strange and disgusting, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
However, "the rewarded, multiannual favorite and light entertainment program of British TV" was at the same time "screaming parodie of black people".
Henry worked in the 1980s in the second series of comedy, where both were made a joke and admired black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character as a cook Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with advertising, documentary, TV series and movie parts, but after his 2008 LennyHenry.tv series in BBC, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that the trails are just on your spot or on the side tracks."
The next one was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?"
In the first part, Shakespeare was discussed.
I've always been trying to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really properly taught to us at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class that wears socks and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
And you know why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 rays of Othello's last speech for a document and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your bag, do a little background research.
So the training process was hard, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The show was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but that was not exactly the case.
Soon after that, Henry played the main part of the Errors' comedy.
Suddenly, I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At some point I was thinking, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry felt clearly that it was his mission to entertain the audience.
"Small voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation will be continued as soon as the problem has been fixed.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me would be relieved.
It's not my duty.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
Henry Fences play at Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to study the "Fences" play.
Panic is a good thing. It makes people more sustainable.
Also this play was well received, so it was like a sign of gods: This is what you must do.
This, of course, is what Henry says with a VOICE.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comic: small humor sons are constantly interrupting our conversation when he switches from imitation to imitation.
Rejection from stand-up committee is a question of will, as it seems dangerous to get immediate thanks to the unknown audience.
If you're thirsty to it constantly, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo theater when it feels like it, but in general it no longer inspires me the same way as before.
I'll ask Henry if he's going to a new stand-up tour.
I am really happy to sit with the director who helps to edit the whole journey at the beginning, the middle stage and the end, and I don't think I'd ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really funny.
The show keeps telling the story, and I am enjoying it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares a register of officials to remove "spook workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in trying to remove "spook workers" from the government's pay lists.
Employees who were not registered in the register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, reported in the government press release.
The government doubts that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to break the public sector corruption after entering the post in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, wages for "spook workers" and other economic abuses amounted to at least $1 million per month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person died or left his official office, BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials should register themselves in the following weeks at identification centres in order to ensure that their data are stored in biometric form, was reported in the Government's newsletter.
According to the information, anyone who fails to do this without an appropriate reason will be removed from the pay lists.
"This measure makes a significant sense for the public sector, because it defines how many people actually operate in their duties, and thus cleanses the pay lists at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of "spook workers", says Anne Waiguru, a staff member of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The result of the 2015 financial year of Wandäjoki may remain a deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adapts its activities and expenditure developments in the tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual deficit is about 9.4 million.
Possible means of improving the scope and level of services, the purchase of services, the sale of property and grants, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
The EUR 10 million reduction target for investments is 8.5 million.
There's no relief for the situation in the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the insufficient increase in tax revenues, the increase in unemployment and the reduction of government shares by 5% further weaken the prospects.
The purpose of the Talousse seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government is unanimous about the need for savings.
The ship must be translated into the strategy's objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Council.
The City Board returned the proposals made to the management group for preparation.
The proposals of the City Government are the basis for the preparation of budgets at the delegation's economic seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After a delegation seminar, the draft budget will be forwarded through the board of directors to the city administration and the city council.
Ten Turkish police arrested suspected of "drunk" government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey, suspected of "company against government", reports local media sources.
The police didn't comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations in December last year, involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey for the organisation of a large crime unit and for the monitoring of telephones.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (which served as Prime Minister during that period) said that police activities were part of the Islamic Director Fethullah Gullen's planned action against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not held at every school.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slavianski school, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
Traditionally, children’s shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers are included in the first day of school.
According to Perry in Texas, the disgraceful tweet was unauthorized.
The Twitter account confirmed by the Governor Rick Perry of Texas was sent on Sunday night with a devastating picture of the district lawyer of the Democrats during the hearing of the accusations about abuse of power.
The Tweet was removed later, followed by a new tweet, where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was unauthorized from my account.
"I don't accept tweets and I have removed it," the later publication said.
Perry's backup forces did not respond immediately to the clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first twit included a disgraceful image of Travis District Advocate Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to drunk in April 2013.
Perry stopped the financing of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, leading to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is the possible candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
The title of Tweet was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times allowed with greater profiles... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for showing his finger."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg agency did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called charges a political plot.
His influential legal team has asked the court to reject the accusations and said that the law on the charge of the governor most far in Texas is unclear in the way of the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in State aid to the public inviolability unit operating in Travis County and handling public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted the left-wing monitoring group to file an official complaint on the matter.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After reaching the fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to stop playing the game by publishing a picture on Twitter on the lake, which is self-driven, with the text "Here we come, South Carolina!".
According to Berkeley, the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's main builders has warned that South-Eastern England's housing market has "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The capital of London has been driven by enormous demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which has led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, the founder of the high-level builder Berkeley and President Tony Pidgley said that "from the beginning of the current economic year the market and the number of transactions have returned to normal after 2013" and added that this has enabled a "stability environment".
During the decline in the London housing market, foreign investors sought a herd to the capital.
According to the data of the land register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the year before alone and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7%.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by about the fifth year, reaching a price increase of GBP 423 000 by the end of April.
However, the fortified pound has made London's properties less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also affected new real estate taxes and political rhetoric of possible "cart tax" before the May general elections.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April housing loan report, which reported more stringent loan orders, would lead to the level of market growth for matt lamb in terms of both sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
The recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, indicating the cooling housing market.
The real estate broker Hamptons International has declined from London's 2015 forecast real estate prices, according to which the prices will fall by 3% because the index of the housing owners' views on prices has already begun to be weak.
The number of transactions in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in a quarter of a year ago, says the real estate broker WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who raised revenue from sales to over GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, correct product in the best locations has remained stable and therefore the sales have remained vigorous".
In June, the company reported its sales of 3,742 new homes in the year preceding April, which is almost one third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual profits before taxes rose by 40 per cent to GBP 380 million a year ago and turnover rose by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday before the Annual Meeting of the Company, Pidgley told me that Berkeley’s years’ earnings correspond to the current expectations of the market.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's share sold on the London stock exchange at a fair price of GBP 23.96 in the afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures on the net
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards Awards Awards.
The hacker, who claims to hold 100 other stars pictures, leaked Oscar's photographs of Jennifer Lawrence on the internet.
The star star's representative confirmed that the images were authentic and condemned the hacker's "unpleasant insult of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and everyone who publishes the photos stolen by Jennifer Lawrence will get the charges.
The images originally published on the 4chan image publishing page were apparently in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud recording system. The 100 other hacked star list is claimed to have dozens of other women like Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
We don't know how many of the pictures are real, but Scott Pilgrim vs. World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"To those who look at pictures taken by me and my husband in privacy in our home years ago: hopefully you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
However, the Victoria Justice of the "iCarly" and "Victorious" series of Nickolodeon forbids the authenticity of the pictures and tweets that "the so-called naked pictures of me are Wrong, you don't understand".
Let me put an end to this immediately at the beginning.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
Only the extract from the new novel that we have received from Howard Jacobson's praise, which tells us about love and the j letter
They dissolved, it was the best picture of what happened, gradually they separated each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from a woman that was too serious, difficult, intense, separated, and perhaps also a little bit tricky.
That's when he whispered his hand.
He identified the brick.
Yeah, he was a spark, like a silk.
His last victim was at the beginning a relationship that, however, had been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have facilitated his lonely boring, and perhaps it could have brought some content to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had unsustainable hairs and was a sensitive, breathtaking beauty in a joyful heart, from the northern village, which was even harder and farther away than Port Reuben.
He had come south with a parent traveler, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. He had inherited a house in a wet but paradise valley, and the valley was appropriately named a Paradise valley.
No one had lived in the house in years.
The pipes were leaking, all the bathrooms had spiders, the quads had left their trails in windows, keeping the whole place in their own, the garden grew with rich grass, which resembled giant cabbage.
The cottage was like children's saddle, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Reported by the writer: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is conditional on the Booker Literature Award in 2014.
Proposals will be published next week
Kevern had sat in hand with Alinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long July, enjoying the surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening disgustingly to a receiver through which the whole country heard calming music and calming news when Alinn’s crosses, sun-brown legs brought Kevern’s mind into a song that had long ago been sung by a forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to the hoods below.
Your leg's too big.
These songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not forbidden — nothing was really forbidden — they were simply no longer called.
They were wanted to forget, as was the word "forgot" itself.
The general opinion resulted in what had not been achieved by laws and pronouncement: just as in the book of literature people chose to read heroic memories, cooking books and romance, they favored ballads for music.
Kevern, who was wildened by the day, started to tap an imaginary piano and sing a serena to Alinn's big feet with a rude comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a jazz pianist Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and at the same time he naturally lifted two fingers in front of his mouth.
That's how his father had always done before the "j" book was able to escape from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was small.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let a word out of your mouth with j and you didn't remember raising two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game then, and it wasn't it right now.
He knew it was expected from him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard anything like that.
Even Jazz was not really banned, it was not just called.
The improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was room in life for only one if-word.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to nostril.
Its unpredictableness made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's parial CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Taking into account the age of Alinn, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws, nor for sanctions.
The celebrity society meant that each part of it accepted the principle that each group did natural things to it — thankful for having been saved as a business of happiness.
Based on their Temperaments and their physical characteristics, the African-Cariban tribal roots are best suited to entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Initially, those from the continent of India were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that each family had a functional phone used to handle things.
Those who were left from the Polish community worked as pipers; the last Greeks broke the board.
When SE, WHAT WAS, WHERE WAS WAS, they came from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear that they would be accused of the gripping of flames and feared that the flames would follow them, opened restaurants where the labneh yogurt was served and the water pipe was burned, and continued their lives looking at the land, created and depressed.
Let everyone work according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballades, and he was hard to understand how the insulting words of Kevern had never been dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except maybe they think it's big-ass.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage leaves.
Still, Ailinn didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers on his lips with Alinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird now.
"It thought Dad was funny," he said instead.
Ailinn fell his head unfaithful, and his hair covered Kevern's sight field.
There's nothing else to see around the world, except the huge, black-stained hairdryer of Alinn.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say that," he said but didn't sound convinced.
But it doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too early for it.
"You're attractive to me because of your thick necks," he tried to fix the situation.
Well, I'm a little twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to laugh, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the persuasive charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons rose red and rose from his terrace chair and at the same time cast the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drink.
The wine was made only of spine flowers, so he couldn't use it as the cause of a collision.
With his nervousness, he seemed to tremble like the leaves of the palm trees in the storm.
"And your thick head is the one that screams me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry on behalf of Alinn, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the time when Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd beat?
He had never told Kevern about life in a great northern archipelago, where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been the same as life here.
The same huge, shiny sea that waved against them.
The same men, though, even more pale and devil than their smuggler and distraction parents, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to beat every woman who dares to resist or tempt them.
Big head?
He'd still see a thick box if he wasn't careful!
Ate first — kissing had become the most common word for the erotic encounter of man and woman; ate first and then attack the receiver out the antidote of irrelevant love ballads.
Kevern thought it was too much, too, because absorbing itself was already hostile.
Ailinn Solomon's body tongue urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Also Ailinn felt tired, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed his way — just as his travel partner looked at Kevern’s way upstairs — a man who himself was responsible for his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He had a feeling of compassion for Kevern and men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike him.
A man who turned his back, bended, shameful, beaten, who had lost all the desire to fight — why did he feel that that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that once before this moment he had seen such things?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the just described event, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old scientist Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private institution of general mind measurement at Ofnow, carried out a short study on the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in the regions of the country where the decline in violence, or the end of violence, was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to break it.
"Many has already been achieved, and there is much to be done," he wrote, "to compensate for the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in the abandoned and peripheral coins, where, despite the church offices across the penguins, human suffering is rarely known in times.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it gives rise to.
The people are crying with sentimental ballads, slandering stories of defeated conflicts and swearing to the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps in their indulgence both rural communities and urban communities, and there is also evidence of a new, more solitary challenge in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
"You have to deplore the tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
Besides, I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbian?
The Agency continued to appeal to its right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I am opposed to atheism, lesbian sex and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of unprecedented society.
Although some kind of hypersensitivity itself is completely acceptable and respectable, it may sometimes lead to distorted results, to what you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or maliciousness, others usually call natural energy and physical power.
Understanding what happened, if it happened yesterday, would destroy the basic vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon-wale LED light proclaimed the instructions that Ofnow had distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballades, go to music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and singing word is better than writing, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered with a silent voice when it was certain that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as efficiently healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we will repeat the same mistakes that were originally leading to HIS, WHAT WAS, WHAT WAS WAS, WHAT WAS WANT?
This time, however, we do not pour out our hatred and our mistrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you describe as 'fellows' the works that our grandparents may have done or not.
You also go too far when you say that they spilled 'their hatred and distrust to others'.
One in a position like you should not have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we do not speak of 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was the time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say that they have been doing well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done, what was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk more about it – we agree.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, neither do you have to make corrections, whether appropriate or not, and even if there is any way to do them.
But for what is the past, if it is not learned?
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said that Esmen was time to leave.
The next day, when he was working normally, he was hit by a motorcycler driving on the pedestrian hall, whose passing travellers described as "a bad soul and anger".
Randoms happen.
Lesotho Army forbids to plan a strike; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The military officials of Lesotho have forbidden the attack on the government and said they were acting against the police suspected of trying to weaponize political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country saying that the army had surrounded his official home and ruled government buildings in the capital of Masero.
The Head of State travelled with his family to the neighbouring country after telling him that he had been threatened by death.
The military representative Major Ntlele Ntoi banned the attack and said that the army responded to the threat that came from "political fanatics", the police have been told to try to weaponize fanatics.
"The forces of Lesotho took action after obtaining several intelligence information that some police forces are trying to weaponize young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news office.
According to Clayson Monyela, President of the South African Government, the military action seemed to be a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no authority has claimed to have joined the government by means of force, the action of the forces of Lesotho seems to be the symbol of the revolutionary company at all sides," he says.
According to the military officials of Lesotho, the soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that this is the subject of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June when Thabane interrupted the parliamentary meetings because of disagreements between the large coalition government.
He thus denies the power of the government, although it is argued otherwise.
Sales store: Microsoft is setting up a data center for the new land
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data center for the new country, where the company does not agree to clarify its location.
In a newsletter sent to the media by Microsoft, the company notes that it does not state the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's a investment for Microsoft for hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the public, the centre had previously been beaten up by Oulu or Kayania.
Microsoft completes its office in Oulu, which takes the job for about 500 people.
Overall, Microsoft has announced its termination in Finland with a maximum of 1,050 jobs.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
About the setting up of a data center, then told the New York City on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater pictures and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you have several different device options to choose.
The most advantageous option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that should be respected.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproof.
In addition, set the camera image settings to match the pictures or video to take.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a setup to optimise the description conditions under water.
In addition – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can go.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Get to know both regular and water-sustainable models in our shopping guide and digi camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to sue the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows a fork, which means taking several pictures at a time with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when filming in the swimming pool, in the lake or in the sea.
This also gives you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target to be described.
This is an important advice on the land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of image, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target so that the target meets the entire frames of the picture.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders — mentors swear to revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that the voters in Hong Kong should not elect candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the lack of peace that calls for a democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business quarter after the activists have begun to plan and implement expressions only hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communists practically power to dismantle all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still annoying," says the chairman of the Democratic Party, the legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we work with self-government.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that the general candidate for the Hong Kong leader's election would be too "caotical".
From 1997 onwards, when the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised to the inhabitants of the region that it should elect its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough, because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process strictly through the appointing committee managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In the summer before the decision, some of the largest and most attention was given to the region from the protests that were raised in Hong Kong to years.
Behind a democratic campaign, there was a large part of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace business, which the organizers have threatened to prevent the business block from operating if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine general right of vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of the supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main administrative buildings.
In the protest, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of civic disobedience, and they would be able to bring about waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they apparently did not tell the details, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In its publication on the network, the organizers said that the movement "thinks the Occupy Central Summit as the last way to be introduced only if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been missed and that taking over the centre will be happening.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday the security operations were tight close to the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing power over their city is a source of peace.
The wave of people coming from the continent has led to competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are going to disappear under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central business because its expressions threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions — the business world.
"The process they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it takes," says Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread our concern that Hong Kong is sneaking away from us.
Such an image would be bad to invest.
There are also stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the guerrillas of the Western Powers that draw up revolution."

United States prom tradition hits British universities: for new students private jets
We are thrilled to respond to demand by establishing the first class of British luxury for today’s students.
In addition to a private plane, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival to the university.
Stewart says there is also a security aspect in the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property through the country in cars loaded from their extremities.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-quality transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company's representative, reservations have not yet been made because the service has only been established, but added that "the students will start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 academic yearly fees.
Today’s students are very different from their expectations and hopes than they started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the University Division of the Organisation, "this service plan seems to be really far from the student majority's life".
Many of their studies in this month are shocked by the level of living costs, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been left behind by the huge increase in basic living costs.

Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to flush to the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the incarnation of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget the heart of his US fight and cleared the second half of Ukraine's blood with his adventurous solutions.
But Salin transferred all the honor to the wolf fans and did it in the style:
I was going to go to the field at the end, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, but my fog, couldn't do anything.
The noise and the white audience were almost too much for me.
The time of Salin’s efficiency kept nine surfaces inside at a fast pace, ball discs, discs and teasing everywhere.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into such a flow mode that everything worked.
They're just coming somehow, now to an insanely important place, Sasu shook.
It's my role.
Do all of that.
Now it was great to see the rest of us get caught by the drunk.
It got caught by the whole gang.
Salin is a team's joyful and spirit-creator, so no wonder that his example raised the entire team up to a flight that was too big and hard on the five of Ukraine.
Finland in the World Championships after 32 years of break: The previous ones were remembered by a rough judge game
Heikki Montonen (Ok.) was the main coach of Finland in the MM tournament in Argentina in 1982.
It has passed 32 years since the last time the Finnish men's football team played at the MM final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as last day: it was a hot-fired fight against France.
"The game at that game was a blazing game," Kosonen remembered.
We had already won, and both teams had already set back.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the pastes got more crazy," said Parkkali.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montose and finally placed in 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's selections, when the Polish MM tournament will be launched today on Saturday.
Many things have changed roughly in international balloons over 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same class as before, but there is more quality and skills now.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is faster," said Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to get out of the first block.
Then you can come tight already," Kosonen says.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a victorious fight against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope that we're going to beat the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go to the corner," said Parkkali.
The species legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the country team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körrkkö winded up in the Tunisian match.
The sauna and evening exercise in the Buenos Aires Seaman Church were part of the country team's programme in the 1982 World Cup tournament.

Finnish tourists saved the mountain of Cita in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog were in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered courageous help.
The weekend Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
In the public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told me that the Cita dog who had been in the mountains with him hurt her ass on Thursday.
The wounded dog was no longer able to walk on a sharp ground.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't do it, so I had to leave it alone.
I tried to attract and draw it a little further, but his feet didn't just wear, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no assistance from the police, the close hotel or the pass.
At night, the situation started to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two walkers who were willing to help: Antti Soini, Tampere, and the Judge of his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and went to their camp where they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively peaceful in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells the evening-Sanoma in his message.
Soon there was also a German man who had a trip pattern with him.
From the mattress to Cita, some kinds of pairs of dogs were attached to the wounded dog.
The German man came here for a moment after us, when we had been thinking about what to do with the dog and carrying the dog for a moment at the bottom of the border, Soini says.
Photo: Judge Soini
The dog could be worn down with a trip pattern.
Soin said that the performance was not physically heavy, but in the difficult ground, it was slow to carry.
About an hour and a half, however, Cita was happy to get down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them again.
Soins answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still not reached.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I don't think I thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I will be forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had received happy hearings from Mikkelsen: "Cita is already feeling better!"

Genetic abnormality is often diagnosed wrong
For years, a British woman was afraid of death because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers believed most of his youth that he had only a few years of life left because he had diagnosed another disease.
Seriously he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage brain and spinal nerves.
According to Charity CMT UK, the wrong diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases because they are so little known.
According to estimates, about 23 000 people in the UK are suffering from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in the motorway, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes painfulness.
The disease may also cause anxiety or pain, and it is unhealing and progressing, which means that symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was sick of Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed to be in the wheelchair before he was 18 years old and died before he reached the age of 30.
Nowadays, a 51-year-old mother of two children says, "when I was a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and I took everything longer than anyone else.
I was never able to scroll or scroll with other children, and I was tempted at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several axis cuts to make his legs smooth. In the course of the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked into his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the disease information in the library and wrote to the FA association," she says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicous.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I was 25, and between that I would slowly lose my entire operating capacity.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers tells me that by the age of 17 he found that his walk had not worsened as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just embraced me and said, "Daughter, darling, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you would be already in the wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
On the basis of some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
"When I was explained what CMT was, I thought I was delayed," she says.
Charity CMT UK will arrange for the month CMT to pay attention to the disease.

Russia's space test failed - Gecos sent to a sex trip died
Five small chokes sent to Russian space have died, says the Russian Federation Space Organisation Roscosmos in its press release.
Gecos traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Finland on Monday morning.

The French authorities informed on Sunday.
The authorities found him after he had attracted a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.

Coponen: We have a good chance to win
The hopes of the Basketball Country Team for a retreat are at stake when Finland meets today in the second fight of the World Cups in Ukraine.
If a loss of opening for the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance to win, Petter Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the first race in the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under the command of Ukraine playing aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion three years ago.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter's quick guy, but yes we've been played against those before and we have to get our standard defense clean, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised Finland to play better than yesterday's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you to see a normal wolf crawl on the field, Möttölä said.
The naken pictures of Hollywood stars are spreading on the Internet, a part of the secured real
There are a number of naked images on the Internet that are alleged to show known publicity.
Among other things, the actress Jennifer Lawrence has been victims of a "natural campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published the angry comment made by Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross insult to privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) photos stolen by Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives will be threatened.
According to TMZ, the actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that she's spreading are real.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what awful trouble was seen for this.
I feel sympathy for all who were the victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, the actress Victoria Justice says pictures that go under his own name are fake.
At least there are real or falsified nasty pictures from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsk and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalkeeper criticized his own people, "do not work enough to get out of here."
The FC Honka football club is currently the last place in the Battle League.
The comments made by paintman Walter Viitala after the VPS match on Sunday describe the confusing current situation of the company.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But everything needs to be adapted," Viitala said after the 1-2 defeat ended.
Honka made a lot of mistakes in the fight, especially in the first half of the time.
Painting officer Viitala was not happy with bad defence play.
Player transport has been active this summer in Hong Kong, and that is why the defenders in front of the Viitala have also changed to a sharp pace.
With the player's line, many young players have also had opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"The part does not work enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala threw without appointing any single player.
Hong Kong's main coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I said after the game to certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun and you think you are a betting player and don't have to work, you probably are in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and use the opportunity, it's not my fault.
Kuqi, however, also reminded that players cannot expect immediate success when gambling friends are constantly changing.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the defense head, people have changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this place," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, the Honka is a serial bond, the second one in the balance with the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so the Espoo people still have time to avoid falling into One.
I've never dropped the team, and I'm not gonna drop now.
We will certainly not drop out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala threatened.

The video has become an Internet censorship, and it has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View angle to the wolf ulcer (also): How can the growth of the fan number explain?
Today was a great guy.
This was what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the EM final round against France at the Athens Marouss Ball Hall.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I remember the game when I was there.
That was also the case with about 100 Finns who shouted on 20,000 viewers, otherwise in an empty hall.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukrainian World Cup?
In Bilbao there are eighty times a hundred Finnish fans.
The 1995 EM competition was the search time for Finnish basketball.
The men ran their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian match in the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttö.
The main coach Henrik Dettmann raised the final tournament team with the limelines of Möttölä.
The solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was very wise, even though not everything went according to the manuscript.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens races, Finnishs were known to have a total of over 100.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I don't think anyone can say exactly a figure of Finnish racers.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
There was a number of things in the meantime, it was an incomprehensible number.
Here's to explain to sports sociologists.
In the global world economy, companies transcend borders.
There is still a chance in sport to look at how we are going internationally.
Increasing mobility, we can see how our girls and sons succeed in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Sport Sociology.
Certainly, both in Spain and at the World Football Championships in Poland there are Finns who are seeking experience.
Common experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
Sports itself must be attractive.
I'm crying to raise sports into a popular culture.
There's a lower threshold to go to sports than to Berlin to watch art.
But without success, we can't move the masses.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, principal coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves to top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the ground team operation was lifted to the ground.
Airball people did the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruit of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sports, where the sacred trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public will also be interested in it.
And the media has taught what such a karnevalist support is, Itkonen reminds.
Can ball races transfer this massive interest to domestic series as well?
The basketball and the ball are played on average for hundreds or a little more than a thousand viewers.
Weeping thinks the question is good, and it does not necessarily give a answer that would be very good for species.
Another school thinks the interest is moving.
The other one is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This team is ready for a lifetime for the World Championships, but in their basic thinking the domestic series are not interested twice.
It's a challenge for comrades in the middle of the drug.
Bottas for the property - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake's beach
Nastola is rewarded by the formula driver Valtteri Bottas with the beach house.
At its meeting, the municipal government approved a surrender of 1.4 hectares on Monday by unanimity.
In the future, there will be a free-time apartment for the property.
In Nastola, the success of Bottas has been monitored since the karting times.
He's being tried to be a messenger to market Lahti, Lahti and Nastola.
The giftless is located in Koiskala, Kärkjärvi beach.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of the larger real estate trade.
There are seven decommissioned buildings in the region, of which the municipality will decommission six by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved the Formula 1 in the Belgian competition this year's fourth prize winner.
He's at MM points at the fifth.
Bottas is a native Nastalian and has lived in the VilSource.
He lives today in England, but he goes to Nasto every time he's free from the forms.
Bottas has visited higher education and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come... but hardly for the poor.
It presents and tests them at the current US Open Tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are the field's ball-persons, but also the high-level amateur Marcus Giron holds that.
He said that the shirt would help him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Their nail shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the data is transmitted to the shirt and from there to the smartphone or table computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The mosquito as a central unit is discarded before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told the exact time for the beginning of the shirt sale, nor even suggested its price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that puts on smart clothes.
The California Athos has brought a smart shirt and a smarthort for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
Clothing costs $100 per piece and the central unit of the thumb, which they demand, costs $2.100.
Red Orbit also wrote about technovates.
Smart way to save in teaching books
For many students, the cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000, so soon Matt Schroeder, who starts his second year of study, invented a smart way to save the cost.
He developed a system in which students in subsequent courses borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books at the same time.
"My mathematics book would normally have paid $180; I paid it for the entire semester, $10 and a sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his last semester books would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he used $120 for them.
According to the University Board of Directors, the average student uses more than $1,200 per year for teaching books and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
An increasing number of students rent teaching books, allowing them to use the book for the entire semester and pay much less than the book buyers.
According to Neebo Inc, which holds more than 250 campus book shops, the rental of teaching books has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about one quarter of the books of universities' books lasting in spring were rental books, says Neebo’s president Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campbook shops.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online purchases
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would pay in the campus book store.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but the Chegg.com book from special books online gets $239.99.
Purchase used
Used books are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and the past look.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used for the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, reports that he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" using Amazon.com online store for only $0.42.
The new book would have cost us $48.
Ingrid Bracey and other academics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls recommend that students ask their professors whether they can use previous prints in the course.
Sometimes reforms of the new emphasis are not essential for teaching.
In this case, an old print can only be found with a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon book stores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
If you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after you have completed the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the new book price.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the whole semester will cost about $20.
Find out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of the emphasis threshold and the subsequent payments.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Acquisition of e-books instead of regular paperwork can also come to the question.
Sometimes these books are rented and paid for the right of use of an e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store gets an e-book of the Calculus book for about $61 for six months.
According to Bracey, many students in literature are saving the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while science and technology books may be very expensive.
It's worth comparing the different sellers, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdinen in the legal field, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it will ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure that the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this stance.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to obtain the book at the full price from the university bookshop.

In fires almost doubled the number of people killed last year
In fires, nearly twice the number of people died this year compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Civil Protection Centre (Spek), 55 people have already died in fires in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
More than 65 years of age have been 11 years of age.
According to the system's fire deaths, the situation was worse last in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people had died in fires.
Most of the fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in floor houses, 21 home houses, seven in lines and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the fire safety of your home.
At least all fire warners in the home should be secured according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that initial ignition devices are easy to use.
All home premises must also have an unobstructed exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are at home alone.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport to the NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the Cardiff City Hall at the so - called counter - summit meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed events this weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived even from Belgium.
Young people were saved by air from Australia’s Blue Mountains
TWO teenage patrolers were lifted to safety after they had been stuck in the nights in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man left to walk after noon on Sunday for Govetts Leap to Blackheath.
People were worried about young people who hadn't returned home and called the police at 8:00.
A search team of local police and assistants was sent to search for young people, and two were found around 23:00 near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The cops spent the night with a couple of people, and they were raised safely on Monday morning.
The patrolers were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital in an ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukraine's soldiers withdrawn from Luhansk Airport
Ukraine's troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, a retreat order was given to the soldiers.
According to Ukraine, the landing crews have been working hard with Russian tanks in the field.
According to the military representative, the gunfire of the counterpart has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to have Russian professional soldiers.
During the last day, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovan Sea in the presence of South-East Ukraine, the Ukrainian patrol ship last night fell down in the morning, reports the border guard.
Eight Marines have been saved and two are still missing.
The border guard didn't know where the ship was shot.
The separatists told me yesterday in social media that they shot a ship.
According to the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Mr Lavrov, however, insisted that Ukraine's troops should immediately retreat into positions where they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate ceasefire without any conditions.
Mr Lavrov also recalled that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains caused the flood of Malmö and Copenhagen
On Sundays, the streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the heavy rains sprinkled in South Sweden and Denmark.
The floods broke several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars alone.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that flooding may last, even though rains were predicted to end for Monday.
Heavy rains were surprised by the Swedish authorities and no weather warning was given in advance.
Ari Mustala, an emergency meteorologist at the Finnish Institute of Climate Science, estimates that the saddle port in the region was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and permanent.
It's not surprising if it's been difficult to predict.
French socialists should "shut up and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Valls strongly urged the split left to "show his feelings" to the socialist president in difficulty, whose new government was not approved by the French majority.
The President deserves respect for all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay with him," Valls said and deserved applause.
As a congratulations, the Prime Minister called on the Government to leave peace, despite the 35-hour working week in France which was controversial, despite the debate that Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs, earlier this week, had made on the proposal that the rule should be reduced.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to work together with the government.
However, Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, led to disparity by meeting the socialist representatives of different opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing France to abandon hope in relation to the future.
The head of the Marine Le Pen of the National Front of the Faroese Sea ridiculed the continuing disparities of the socialists and said that the new Valls government would not last for a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone on calling for war, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the last one did not even last for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to the journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dismantle the parliament and felt that his party was sure to win the election in premature elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The ruling party in France suffered a breakdown in the municipal elections in March and the extremist right held a listing spot in the May European elections.
According to the opinion of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French believe that the Socialist Party may break up in several competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
The political researcher at the Po University, Pascal Perrineau, warned that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and high unemployment rates.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka betrayed tomorrow the Finnish riders Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Puda badly betrayed the program in the taped part.
Tomorrow, Finland's program published on Thursday’s Facebook page about the recordings of a funny video on Thursday.
On the video, the riders Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record tomorrow on the post of Finland's advertising pub the next day, but the recording doesn't go all the way into the tube.
Alm-Siira is nuts in his words when he is trying to say the word of a budgetary dispute, and his nuts also make Puda and Rahkolan lose their pounds once after another.
And these heroes should be allowed to draw a direct broadcast even tomorrow, tomorrow's Facebook update in Finland says.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and it has both been enjoyed and distributed on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, worked at the picture office, was placed third in the series of potretts in 1972.
The picture is the Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir.
In the Fredrik City of Helsinki, a Socialist International Meeting was held in May 1971 at the Building Masters' House.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting and security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with me.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture in four feet.
The light and the background were right.
Soon I realized I did it this time.
It seems to me that the leaders in the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition handled images of known people or events.
It's great that you can succeed with other pictures today, as long as you have an idea and a visual tone.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall of the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Confirmation: Aarnio's investigation already paid more than EUR 5 million
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Police Unit has already cost more than €5 million and has required 30-50 years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki evaluates the fact that he has done to Jyväskylä University in the field of information technology.
Bordermäki suggests that the lawfulness of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and legal proceedings.
According to the border hills, current technology enables multiple use of criminal technical material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the data collected to detect the crime are automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain, while allowing comprehensive legal control.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Cassasvisdied fish and chicken foods"
A picture of a special press release on the wall of the school for quick travel by women caused a dining place in the social media, says Yle on its website.
Plant feeders!
Fish and chicken foods included at school lunch were planted.
Only when there's meat on the list, we're making a plant option!
This is what is said in the forgotten 15 - year - old bulletin on the school wall.
You'll be able to see the picture from here.
The picture spread in social media has led people to send the enraged feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Chief of Food and Cleanliness Service, says to Yle that the forgotten note on the wall is not true and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I arrived, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed in time with health care.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, says Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are only provided with the permission of their parents and with the certificate of a doctor or nurse for a plant food.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people’s plant food trials may leave no nutrition and the lack of meat or chicken may be amazed by their parents.
Norwegian Cruise near the $3 billion Prestige Cruise Agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
As a result of the trade, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to the luxury cruises of Prestige Cruises and the rich customers when continuing to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on the possible agreement may be published already this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be public because negotiations are not held in the public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships whose route map covers North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when its turnover was $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, has the Oceania and Regent brand names, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is 6% higher than in the previous year.
In the coming years, the $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies, such as China and India's middle classes.
Companies compete to become the first option for these new customers when choosing to cross.
Prestige Cruises registers its first stock circulation on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares after 2007 trading with a value of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 in its current composition after its association with the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) crossroads company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of the Maleisian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting accounted for 28 per cent of the company, 20 per cent of Apollo and 8 per cent of the private equity company TPG Capital LP from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise totalled 82% of North America's cross-border capacity, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in the event of the release of shares.
The City of Tampere is discussing this today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will support the initiative firmly.
According to the President of Animalia, Salla, who prepares the dissertation to the University of Tampere, during the period of the Delfinaarios in Finland and around the world, it is urgent to end.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a general view that dolphin-like advanced mammals in dolphin are neither animal-protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would be hoped to be taken into account in Tampere too.
The termination of the Delfinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination.
According to the threat of judgment, the death of Näsi-delfine confirms the requirements for the lower limit of dolfinary activity.
It's sad to go on to the dark history of the Delfinar of the Särkymemi.
It is time to set a point for the dead, close the dolphin prison, and start to find out how to transfer the dolphins to a bordered sea area, to a sort of dolphin shelter, which requires the threat of judgment.
The nase did not have the time to experience the return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Scrubs could experience even more life than the unstimulated concrete, the Hazard of Judgment hopes.
The objective of the Animalia Union is to prohibit the use of all wildlife species in circus in the overall reform of the animal welfare law in preparation.
There are also dolphinariums in this group.
In support of this requirement, the Director of Animalia's Executive Director, Judgment Danger, is taking part in the spirit statement to be held today on 1.9. on behalf of the dolphins.
The spirit statement to be held by the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a position against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting period, approximately 2300 dolphins are captured or brutally killed every year, either for dolphinary use or for food.
Putin calls for Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with East Ukraine
On Sunday, the Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the Ukrainian government to stop fighting against separatists in the eastern part of the country and to start negotiations immediately from the "state state" of the different region, the Russian news sources tell us.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine would be part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to allow the Russian-speaking population the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin's demand for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners corresponds to his obvious strategy since the beginning of the violence five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists to take over the region and thus to force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorossian independence, which will enable it to move towards Russia instead of to the west.
In a State Channel 1 TV interview, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to take back the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region controlled by the separatist forces, which in March and April, after Moskou's accession to the Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, took over by the separatists on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptized the area as "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term resembles the glorious days before the Russian Revolution.
According to the Russian news office Itar-Tassin, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are "new" as long as Ukraine's politicians take campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and the government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We need to start extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of South-Eastern Ukraine, which will take account of the interests of people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "State state" relates to the wider independence of which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in trying to alleviate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a conflict within Ukraine".
The interim note by the representative of Kreml, which was intended to correct the "failure of interpretation" of Putin's comments, emphasised that the Russian government is dealing with the rebellion of the separatists in the eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, which, in practice, conquered a region with a majority of 2 million people ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to join even the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to the opinion of the pre-conflict, most of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence which the Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the Ukrainian local authorities the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give Kremlin power in practical terms in the area that unites Russia with the Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was joined with Russia five months ago, is located by the Russian Navy, as well as by commercial port areas and historic coastal counties.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia that produce vital products for the Russian army.
In his official speech on 7 June, the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions derogating from the nuclear area of Ukraine on their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists, perhaps armed and flushed, of Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin presented its latest demands to the Kiev Government for negotiations with Russian rebells as equal partners after last week, after the Russian tanks and troops entered East Ukraine from the former peaceful region of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovski by the separatists supported by Russia is the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategicly important coastal area to the Crimea.
It has led massive civilians and military personnel to strengthen the city of Mariupol. The half million inhabitants of Mariupol are known as a steel-producing harbour town located between Novoazovsk and the narrow countryside leading to the Krim Peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels and called for further measures to prevent Russia's future insults in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We'll soon get a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed additional sanctions to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine is re-emerging in unclear circumstances.
Ukraine's soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the region of Ilovais after last week's transfer to Donetsk, two Russian armaments and 1,000 soldiers, to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reported to journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers on the island of Russia in Ilovask was replaced by 10 Russian landing jumpers who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago.

Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
In the training debyte of Inzagh, Milan’s former attacker, the San Siro Stadium was only half.
The number of participants in the game was 39,000.
Australian publishers and Gabi Grecko in the nasty image scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he's been annoyed by hackers who might have stolen his fiancée and the nasty photos of Gabi Grecko, Hollywood A list.
In the entertainment world, a bunch of nasty photos of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the internet as a result of a large celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 naked pictures of star Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The photos of Australian actors, Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsk and Melbourne Grecko, are apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There's 101 names on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Grecko last month, said to the Confidential magazine, "this is disgusting."
All personal contact and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
It is reported that Greckon in New York has commented on the case in the online magazine as "shameful" and said that the victims are "shamed."
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer at the top of the pool.
Palmer's films include the film "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actors Browning didn't comment on hacked pictures yesterday.
Lawrence's representative told the TMZ that "the question is a brutal violation of privacy."
The actress Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his twiit: "The publication of mobile stolen images is not different from the sale of stolen products in any way."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, just from a legal point of view.

Finland's profit was followed by almost 2000 Finnish supporters, according to STT.
It felt like playing in the field of home.
So great impact the fans had on our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala said to STT.
Finland was in the game with losing already 0-2, but rose to victory with 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a marvelous dress six points behind.
Cuba led one 16-10, but then the Finns got on the charm.
However, a couple of Finnish fans were disappointed when a charter machine could not land in Katowice because of a hard fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the fight.
The Finnish ball fans have conquered Europe at a tough pace in recent days.
In Spain, Bilbao, there are over 8000 Finnish fans in the World Cup of Basketball.
Just as if every Finnish basket had been a win basket, the US star player Stephen Curry praised the Finnish basketball fans after the match on Saturday.
