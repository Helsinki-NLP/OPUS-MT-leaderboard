Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients requiring care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported to Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of COVID-19-affected people have a mild condition, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are healing.
In approximately 14 per cent of the cases, COVID-19 leads to more severe injury requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent of cases develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with the evolution of the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 edition of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to WHO's definition of cases.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (U.S.) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17, 750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Acquisition of cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities in the various countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative impact at 14 days of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 8:00 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This trend was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative impact of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
At 8:00 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that pandemic increases at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation purposes, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6 % and 1 % of cases (not submitted data respectively).
However, a systematic collection is necessary to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios for the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with an > 90% risk of overrun of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the CCPM's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Given the fact that cases were previously grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally have a defined regional population, cases and intensive care beds should, preferably, be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a community-supported transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent rapid risk assessment of the CEPAM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a decommissioning approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases could not leave sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window in which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Without that, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have to face a peak of patients who need intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, the SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less seriousness and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmitted, and it affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this emerging research subject.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will contribute to better capture and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, marked forever the Chinese, who were forced to remain cloaked for the entire duration of the gold week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly equivalent to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SRAS) in 2003; therefore it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and associated disease called coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread throughout China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works on COVID-19 have been published, particularly in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new topic in the growing world.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and forecasting, and we will address some outstanding, yet urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered to be non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common cold 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronary viruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronavirus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Figure 1.1, pneumonia outbreaks of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of coronavirus was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on disease indicated that in 41 confirmed cases only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan sea fruit market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO called the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of drafting this report, the disease had already spread throughout China as well as around 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig. 2).2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of any age, but more predominantly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed into homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and the peripheral.
The average duration between symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincides with the massive movements that took place before the China Spring Festival.
Patient mortality identified as confirmed was 1.44 per cent (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06 per cent (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enclosed viruses containing a simple ribbon RNA.
They can be classified in four genres, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, coronaviruses known to infect the man of the alpha and beta genres.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope is bound to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membraary fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after replication of viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by umbrella glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form the vesiculars containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98 per cent genetic identity between 10 sequencing samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huanan sea fruit market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electronic transmission microscopy, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in ultrafine human respiratory epithelic sections.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less binding to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of INFβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known functional areas or motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the Cryo-ME structure of the full human ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provides indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug scrubing to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV were derived from flaps and that they were transmitted to Man through the swings and the comrades, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 have been advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SRAS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect Man remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., made the assumption that the virus could have been transmitted from flaps to Man by the snakes, which would involve a homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study carried out by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long mushroom mammal feeding eggs, often used in Chinese traditional medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by genetic homology to 99% between a found coronavirus in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its native immune system through molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectine receptors, Toll (LR), NOD (NLR) receptors and RIG-I (RLR) receptors.
By different means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific virus antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help cells T produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the T-cell function by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to control viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious lung and other organ injury and, in the worst scenario, multi-visceral failure or even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidity and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
It is estimated that the mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was an average of 3 days for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the actual duration of the quarantine after a period of incubation as precise as possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic persons from transmitting the virus.
In general, persons exposed to, or infected by, the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throatache, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the disease occurred.
With regard to serious cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of breast radiographic abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow an early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings have been reported from two recent studies on a family and a foyer that occurred following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a population study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoe (55%).
However, 80% required ventilation assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher MERS lethality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat disorders (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
With regard to SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat disorders (13%-25%), and ventilation assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent, for 66,566 confirmed cases worldwide.
Compared, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) from 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2-4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than it was for the epidemics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The emergence of a home often occurs in a family or in a assembly or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals can be carriers of the virus without, however, presenting symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients may be carriers of the virus again, which stresses the need to increase the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white < 4 × 109/L cells and a number of < 1 × 109/L lymphocytes, as well as high aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia have been identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most of them had increased protein C-reactive and erythrocytal sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the D-dimer level, a blood fibrin degradation product, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
Breast radiographic abnormalities are observed in most COVID-19 patients, characterised by bilateral inequal shadows or depolished glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquids and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchanges.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in lower surfactant rates and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the capacity of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapsus.
Therefore, the most worrying breast examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocytes dequamation, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleal syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with the viral and SDRA disease and is similar to that of patients with SRAS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as a primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical events began to be used for diagnosis (which then was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SRAS.
For example, the combination of medical history, clinical events, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a CRISPR technology-based SHERLOCK-based protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the identification of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive band within an hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and rapidity if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support for patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of treatments that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressors, steroids, restored patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients was proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies all work to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the lungs in the first time and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; it includes general oxygenotherapy, high flow oxygenotherapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory impairment.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reactions have been established to lead to cytokinic shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a systemic inflammatory response characterised by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines lead immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibodies, were used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include the modulation of the immune response by T cells, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 signalling suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressors, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
However, high-dose steroids did not have a beneficial effect on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the prognosis.
However, careful use of short-dose low to moderate corticosteroid cycles was recommended for patients with severe COVID-19 form.
At the time of drafting this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in a U.S. COVID-19 patient.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-string RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead has transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been developed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other side effects may occur following combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of restored patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of anti-pathogen antibodies.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Thus, plasma was extracted from blood from a group of patients who healed COVID-19 and injected to 10 severely affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies may cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The antibodies in the blood are generally low, and the demand for plasma for treating severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is essential and more effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and identify genetic codes that encode relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main virus proteins.
This would quickly increase the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used for thousands in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain low or not at all known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective COVID-19 treatment, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or severe remission of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules proved to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest healing rates of COVID-19 were observed in provinces of China using CTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including the Gansu Province (63.7%), the Ningxia Region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the Hubei Province, which had only 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, has the lowest healing rate (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison as many other factors of impact, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his employees published a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine only (MO) and combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
The time of return to normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and the hospitalization time was significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressively, the increase in symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC remains to be clarified through controlled trials conducted on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally deeply concerned about this highly contagious and mortal disease, and those in quarantine also feel a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotoric excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal trends, have been reported.
The mandatory search for contacts and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, may increase anxiety and cause some guilt for the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, as well as any other person in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, a clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal tanks and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-S-based vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live impaired vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on models subject to fatal provocation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical trials have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SRAS disappeared 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and homes of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein sub-entities, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for controlling the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant period (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just starting its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are gradually recovering without any consequences.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are the following (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SRAS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7 per cent over 50 years of age, according to a study of 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to experience underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 against 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential prognostic factor for disease, treatment response and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and the severity as well as the prognosis of the COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
They are therefore traditionally cardiac or hepatic dysfunction markers.
Major clinical symptoms: chest radiographic results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressors commonly used in supplemental treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
Since high dose corticosteroids were widely used for severe SARS cases, many survivors experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent inability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids in patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who often have long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to provide psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and restore normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, SARS-CoV-2 also reacts effectively in the upper respiratory tracts and does not or does not cause any symptoms in the first phase of the infection, like coronaviruses that originate from common colds.
As a result, recently infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuing quarantine of almost all of the population to interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors in the country, the number of new cases has declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of declining will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and others, believes that the COVID-19, which seems to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, and others, developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the samples of the mean nose cornet and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after leaving the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
Initially, the Ebola virus was expected to lead to up to a million cases and a half million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
As with SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 decreases in terms of infection to eventually eliminate or develops into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SRAS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or tinting, and may also be directly contacted with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in sediments, thus revealing a new possibility of oral-foecal transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases may be due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with prior disease and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even any person likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible defence line to reduce the risk of infection is in the port of faculty masks; the use of surgical masks and breathing masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions capable of entering fully; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV size, as both measure approximately 85 nm.
Because particles can pass through five surgical masks stacked onto each other, it is imperative for health professionals in direct contact with patients to wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear customized insulation blouses to further reduce contact with the viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor proved to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus could have penetrated his organism through the eye due to an inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent screens or protective glasses to patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is highly recommended to wash their hands with desinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined as much as possible and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
It is recommended to keep a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre reassured the population by stating that the new virus was low infectious, that it had limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
The Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and may affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) show more sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports of doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its beginning rather than to try to reassure the population; and (4) conduct more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of the population about epidemics, but also to test and regularly improve the response system of society.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of drafting this report, it extended to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to the symptoms of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is a pre-view impression.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SRAS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients, so it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why the SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much wider than the SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection tests may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be again positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the initial host virus, e.g. bats, to Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to the ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cells and how does it result in pathological changes?
Is the virus also bound to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or regularly re-stop like influenza?
It is essential, although it may take some time, to get answers to all these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter what the expenditures that this must induce, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients experienced severe lower respiratory infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Without the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and frescoes, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lympopenia, faused liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of SRAS suspicion.
diffuse alveolary lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophage are also observed in patients with SRAS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal, especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was common in young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients with respiratory disease.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolite is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of a 8-month boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present around the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old hospitalized man due to pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transfer themselves effectively and to continue in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical events of the MERS are similar to those of the SARS and are characterized by acute evolving pneumonia.
Unlike SRAS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high death rate of 34.4 per cent, making the MERS-CoV one of the most known mortal viruses in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to their rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the period of incubation and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in seam samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after transmission to humans, will have an impact on the ultimate destiny of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms were well suited to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
To achieve this, HCoVs must be replicated in humans in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
In this regard, the more the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 persists and the more the number of people infected is important, the more likely the virus will be fully adapted to humans.
If it fits well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or other measures to control infection.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have circulated within the population, causing a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal tank.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediaries and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoV acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired in community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without a tank or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolving, natural, reservoirs, intermediaries and amplifiers of HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolving host of a HCoV if there is a close ascendant sharing high nucleotid sequence homology.
The original virus has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic to its host.
In the same way, a reservoir host maintains HCoV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemility.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80 per cent of Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also be used as intermediary amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive to anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and to the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of the SARS-CoV and that the bats are not the immediate reservoir host of the SARS-CoV.
This is why the bats cannot be the intermediate tank host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East showed that dromenars were HIV-positive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as the camals from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, the infected kamels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory, but also through the fecal, which is also the main way of excretion of the flea.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than that which separates the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-coV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 HCoV-229E, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in gnagars.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while kamelidates were also suspected of being intermediary hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV from the flax near HCoV-229E were found.
Firstly, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with fladdermeat in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contacts with the alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the HCoV-229E related flea is numerous and non-pathogenic in the HCoV-229E flea, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga has caused a respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-coV of the alpaga has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, flaps are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that HCoV-229E can be transmitted directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-coVs of the flax serve as a genetic reservoir of the HCoV-229E, the alpagas and dromadaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the virus to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of fladdermeat to dromadaries and human dromadaries.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in the bats is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these kamels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of the kamels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several inter-species transmission possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the bats could be the reservoir of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological nest with flaps through decay or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediary amplifiers to which a SRAS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the decay and consumption of wild meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species having been in contact with both flea and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is underway.
Compared to other single-string RNA viruses, estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of VOC to new hosts.
However, the CV mutation rates are approximately one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the VOCs are not well suited to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well suited to dromes.
In theory, genetic deduction is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Thirdly, the VOCs randomly and frequently change model during the replication of the NAR through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal VOCs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive evidence of selection during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S1 of protein S means that the affinity of this S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10 to 20-fold higher affinity of this link than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also ties to ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silica acid for HCoV-OC43.
Difference in host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoirs, such as flaps, dromadaries and gnaders, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
New HCoV emergence: return to the starting box
The diversity of HCoVs offers many opportunities for emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, HCoVs are genetic reserves.
Among the accessoires proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered to be important in human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but codated different ORF8 proteins.
This suppression divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressing as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in dromenars in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated flax and kamel viruses, alpha-CoV of the alpaga has a simple addition of nucleotide, resulting in a shift in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that the bats were well suited to the CVs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of flaps-souris could both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and cause highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as flax and camels.
They react firmly without causing a strong immune response of the host.
It is here that the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the severer the pulmonary lesions are.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the CoV replication.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, at least type I interferon administration in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory NLRP3 is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-coV of fladderwood sharing 95% nucleotidic homology with the SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a SARS-CoV of fladderwood sharing 96% nucleotidic homology with the SARS-CoV-2.
Significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2 pangolin beta-CoV has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the kamels to control the MERS, as has been done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in kamels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could develop and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the VOCs of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
Culture of the consumption of wild animals in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In reality, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for infection.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose tanks.
First, if the bats transmit a SARS-CoV-2 parent virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances under which bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how humans get into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, fladdermeat and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by ignoring to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in child mortality rates during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality in children under the age of five, which is almost 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor adverse effect, common hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at hand, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common in health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
Two times a year, combined with the daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated dentistry, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of the soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and to increase solventness.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficultly soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptic agents or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the nature.
Therefore, even though antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, the latter may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, milk acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot and soap water is more effective than cold and soap water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies revealed that the use of hot water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (MRS and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as mushrooms.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely inefficient against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcohol solution must be used to well wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hands wash unless you have water and soap in hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by skin softeners and/or hydrating agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing softeners caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the benzalkonium chloride-using formulas have presented a durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, as opposed to alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
The ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than brake it.
Like soap, the ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alcaline solution in contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
To wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap mouse on the hands by shaking them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, in the fingers and under the nails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Froster for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frotting creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and frotting longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with current water.
Washing in a stagnating water basin can lead to recontamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or free air.
The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, the wrist, spaces between fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and sliced nail vernis can accommodate micro-organisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin drought promotes the appearance of skin injury that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when the water of the rod and/or soap is not available. For example, to drain water from a drill or gourd suspended and perched and/or to use ash, if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a crust hanging with a rope, and a pedal to throw a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in the toilets.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on finger pulp and by 254% on palms.
Air-drive drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand-dryers, and hand-dryers have been compared with drying using paper towels.
Laundry of hands with disinfectant linen is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that give reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical laundry of hands shall last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands mouse and frotted.
Hands must be broken against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the robinet (and open the exit door where applicable).
The aim of handwashing in health structures is to remove and avoid pathogenic microorganisms ("gens").
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
In this process, hands and front arms must be washed up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, it must be avoided that the water on the front arms flows to the hands.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic medicine for your hands before and after having taken care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of Staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved during the first 20% washing, and that there was very little additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robinets to wash hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building handwashing stations.
However, low levels of hands wash can also be due to persistent habits rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be included in the campaigns to promote hand hygiene to reduce infant disease and mortality.
The World Hand Wash Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to stimulate behavioural developments.After the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
However, a review suggests that promoting soap hands washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetides smells called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good handswashing techniques" have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The term "wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicate of something.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.

'Cause it's the flu season
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, which are highly likely to result from the pressures exercised during selection, particularly through the host's immune system.
For example, the loss of complete ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to two nucleotides deletion.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated flax and kamel viruses, alpha-CoV of the alpaga has a simple addition of nucleotide, resulting in a shift in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that the bats were well suited to the CVs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is eliminated by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules in the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of flaps-souris could both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and cause highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as flax and camels.
They react firmly without causing a strong immune response of the host.
It is here that the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the severer the pulmonary lesions are.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the CoV replication.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, at least type I interferon administration in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory NLRP3 is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared in accordance with the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-coV of fladderwood sharing 95% nucleotidic homology with the SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a SARS-CoV of fladderwood sharing 96% nucleotidic homology with the SARS-CoV-2.
While squirrels and other animals on the market were discovered as virus carriers identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2 pangolin beta-CoV has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although issues remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 has been designed by man, whether voluntary or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has significantly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal tanks in the transmission of VHCs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that the SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 originate from the bat and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between humans and squirrels present on the markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of squirrels found there could have effectively ended the SRAS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals, and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the subsequent studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the kamels to control the MERS, as has been done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in kamels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could develop and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the VOCs of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There are no opportunities for these zoonotic coVs to evolve and recombinate, resulting in the emergence of new more transmissible and/or mortal coVs in the future.
Culture of the consumption of wild animals in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of SRAS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be put in place.
In reality, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for infection.
Although bats have many features favourable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for man to be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimised if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose tanks.
All the secrets of the zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First, if the bats transmit a SARS-CoV-2 parent virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances under which bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how humans get into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, fladdermeat and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, testing and testing should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will help to identify the evolving path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant effects on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnostic and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge are progressively progressing on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this mail, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspected case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named a severe acute respiratory syndrome with coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO identified the COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has attracted much attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) received a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially changed.
As our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., the latter submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has brought new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspicious case must include one of the elements of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical events to form a complete analysis, or correspond to three elements of clinical events in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) Fever and/or Respiratory Symptoms; (2) Imagery with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) Total number of white blood cells indicating a normal, reduced or reduced number of lymphocytes from the beginning of the symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with high homogeneity with the newly known coronavirus; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 passing from negative to positive or increased titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s graphic representation should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope that there will be more direct evidence and we ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of suspicious cases and confirmed cases, we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in time to offer its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in a single day.
The country thus recorded a record of mortality due to the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 healed persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded the million in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Over the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the confinement of the city until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the extension of the national emergency status by 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour with 10 abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal HCoV infection may be.
Most of the HCoVs come from bats where they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoV are also known.
Identifying animals has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of host CoV interactions in animals could also help to better understand the CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified in four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The beta-CoV genre contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human VOCs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The trace of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It may also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediary and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with significant implications for the prevention of future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first tribe of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headache, tinting, malaise and throatache, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of the cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present around the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce limit quantities of toilet paper by purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store chains Woolworth and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and one package per purchase in all stores at national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
The buyers apparently raised reservations because of fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a parcel per order.
These measures were followed by the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, stated that with the limitation of four packages in force, "very many stores are still in stock within the hour following delivery," and called the application "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Tuesday Facebook publication, called it "unexpected".
Sales had a "smart increase" last week, according to a spokesman from Woolworths.
Costco store in Canberra also limited the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a promotion scheduled Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early deployment of stocks, some stores are unable to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, expert in the distribution sector of the Queensland University of Technology, explained that the stores re-supply the stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a volume article, resulting in stocks of a reduced quantity which, once exhausted, left large spaces empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider that if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be purchased and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," Russell Zimmerman explained to ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock breaking.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that manufactures Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate vendors offered free toilet paper to the first auctioner at auctions in Melbourne, while less auction sales were organized because the buyers were on leave during the weekend of the Labour Party.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included a eight-page map intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, in which they announced that they did not intend to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Likewise, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andras toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization qualifies COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries persist, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the United States Centres for the Control and Prevention of Diseases, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He stated, in statements published by CNN in February, that "besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its emergence until its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronary virus."
To what he added, "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the United States National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said about the epidemic: "To make it short, the situation will worsen."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, which resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a current coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are healed.
The lethal rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth to cough, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confiscating suspects of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by introducing restrictions on travel, quarantine, firewalls, risk control at work and closures of establishments.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalized shortcomings caused by panic purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, with approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese people, other people of origin and Asian appearance in the East and Southeast, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an outbreak of unknown cause pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened at the beginning of January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to Huanan's seafood wholesale market and therefore it is believed that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus that was recently discovered and closely related to the coronaviruses of flaps, the coronaviruses of pangolins, and the SARS-CoV. Later, it was discovered that the first known person who had symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent link with the subsequent outbreak of the fresh product market.
On the cases of the first foyer reported in December 2019, two thirds proved to have a link with the market.
On March 13, 2020, a non-audited report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, for a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a significant underestimation of cases, including those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and less, representing 2.4 per cent of cases in the world. The United Kingdom Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, felt that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before reaching effective collective immunity.
Cases indicate the number of persons tested at COVID-19, and the test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had for official policies not to test those who had only beneficial symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that, until January 23, 86% of non-detected COVID-19 infections were estimated in China, and that these non-registrated infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 considered that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of the COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for the Control and Prevention of Diseases concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are healing.
For those who do not heal, the time between symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age and 75 per cent suffered pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased persons who have been tested positively with COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, since it could not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that overlihoods during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokesperson of the United States Centres for the Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) recognized "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports of the sub-assessment in the United States. Such under-assessment often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, out of continental China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths in all continents except the Antarctic region. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time spent since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death ratio is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) by April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for symptoms from 1 January to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for symptoms from 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the lethal rate (fatal rate), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who are due to a disease, and the infection rate (infected rate), which represents the percentage of contaminated (diagnostic and non-diagnostic) due to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the pandemic infection rate in its globality is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for the COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on mortality rate estimates.
WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni from the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease has just lacked guests available.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment that this will happen."
The Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries were able to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "to the extent that a vaccine is available (if possible 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronary virus — because it is very easily transmitted — disappears completely" and that it could "be transformed into seasonal disease, which could be re-appeared every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be rather non-specific and the infected persons may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (musculosity), loss of smell, breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, frosting, vomiting, hemoptysia, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is severely ill and has respiratory problems.
The United States Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDCs) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and blue face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, then researchers issued recommendations that persons who had close contact with confirmed infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese asymptomatic ratio assessments range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is more often five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of COVID-19 carrying people who lost the smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is expected to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, thirstying, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected by expiry, especially by speaking, although the virus is generally not airported.
Postillons may land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (CRP) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore lead to air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through the seeds, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has excluded the possibility of a faeco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days following the beginning of the symptoms, but the spread may be possible before the symptoms occur and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive to the disease up to three days before symptoms occurred suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few confirmed asymptomatic cases reports in laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly with what ease the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive to COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces than infected persons.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with Wuhan’s outbreak of acute respiratory disease.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Apart from the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it's of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, to the subgeneral Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from flea.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another sample of flax coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid that differs in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and human viruses.
The comparison of the whole genome has revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but final confirmation is done by reverse transcript of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected or scanned secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and the Wuhan scanner suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as a first intentional test to diagnose the COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Normally this test is carried out on a rhinopharynx sample but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved to be reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic imagery elements on the radiographics and tomodensitometry (scanning) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral depolite opacities of glass and lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the matching with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-free imaging is limited to detecting COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of chest scanners with PCR and demonstrated that if imagery is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending that it be taken into account as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imagery on both radiographics and scanners.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or stretching into a pocket and then throwing the pocket directly into a garbage bag.
Those who had already been contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have banned or disregarded all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the world.
This means that the virus spreads into communities, and some of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. It is advised to health professionals who care for someone who may be infected to take the usual precautions and contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments in this regard raised issues of confidentiality, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications were launched or proposed on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargarging with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visiblely dirty; before eating; and after moulding, coughing, or forevering.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and iodated povidone at 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as a office building or a nursery, all rooms such as office, toilet, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by patients, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or a mouse when they bleach or stretch, and to throw any mouse immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance passed by the projected postillons by speaking, thirsty, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions to explain where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Porting a mask can reduce people's prone to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they deal with a COVID-19 disease, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, CDC recommends wearing non-medical fabric masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in the case of close proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make home masks and to clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public exits without mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask to everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect himself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has imposed the mask on train and interurban bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made the wear of a mask compulsory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a craft mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control infection to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and commercial centres.
Social distance methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now provide or recommend social distances in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the U.S. government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. The older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system were invited to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify the aim of reducing physical contact by maintaining social links, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" meant that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to keep in contact with others by other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to persons in the most vulnerable groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a COVID-19 disease and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to be in quarantine for 14 days from the time they have been exposed for the last time.
The epidemic control strategies are endocrine or elimination, and mitigation.
The outbreak is established during the first phases of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infection and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are moving towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Extinguishing and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to reduce the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive number to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called to flatten the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, worms and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and their participation; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning; more drastic measures aimed at jugulating the epidemic have been taken in China as the gravity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have quarantineed, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowdown but not elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and elimination (reverse the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for health care by 2/3 and half deaths, but can not avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are flooded.
The elimination may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), as if otherwise, the transmission is rapidly rebounding when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without prescription against cold or drink consumption as well as rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on gravity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently under study for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and crafted remedies" can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in capacity and adaptation of health care for patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental measure of response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the re-use of resources at different levels, including by dedicated laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, by revoking non-urgence interventions where possible, by separating and isolating patients tested positive to COVID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the first case (named zero patient).
The first known case of the new corona virus could come back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to Huanan's seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of unknown cause pneumonia was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian in the hospital of the province of Hubei, which informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SRAS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then published a public notice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January. In the first phases of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
At the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and a major rail correspondent.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported in the world; over 97,000 people died and over 364,000 were healed.
Approximately 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted movements and introduced border controls.
National responses included ending measures such as quarantine (also called orders to stay at home, shelter on the spot or confinement) and firewalls. In April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were subject to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people were confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people in the world experienced a form of confinement, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; a non-confirmed report suggests that the first case would come back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown outbreak of cause pneumonia on December 26, to which she informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for having "provoked rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "krig of the people" to endure the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history," a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop traveling from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, involving approximately 57 million people in total.
Private vehicles were prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year Celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was subsequently built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of spring holidays.
The country's universities and schools have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and Chinese museums have been temporarily closed.
Population travel control was applied in many cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) had been involved in one form or another of travel restrictions. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in continental China, only one case had been transmitted within the country within the previous five days, in this case through a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban to Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea pointed out that although this was "uncertainly not a recommendation from WHO," it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and referred to a "unprecedented fact in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the action was invoked in the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
The WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom stated that the IPSU was due to the "global risk of spread, especially for low-income and intermediate-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures are unnecessaryly interfere with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel."

On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be considered a pandemic.
The Director-General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned by both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction."

Several provincial directors of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) have been identified from their functions as a result of their quarantine management in Central China, a sign of discontent to the response of policymakers to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese leaders, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favour of conspirational theories supporting COVID-19 to maintain its origins from the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump described the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or " Wuhan virus," stating that in China "censorship has overfed a virus now become a global pandemic," which was then taxed by some opponents and intended to "draw the attention from the inability of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has obtained a telegram from the US government showing the main lines of a apparent communication strata from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "All comes from China.

Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman of the Kremlin Dmitri Peskov said that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Poutin] is based on the principle that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to make them such a thing if necessary."
The extent of NATO's military exercise "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest manoeuvre of NATO since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.

The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about twenty members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen other ancient or current political personalities.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders to request assistance on 14 March 2020, stating that his country had difficulty in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt common social policies for other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect that this will adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of reelection during the presidential election in 2020. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on sites designated by the government.
The South Korean society was initially divided about the response to the crisis of President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's indictment for the poor management of the epidemic by the government or, on the contrary, commemorating its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.

The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply breaks, resulting from increased global use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of the operation of plants and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings regarding shortages in medicines and medical equipment due to increased demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also faced panic purchases that resulted in the disappearance of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, radius, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted to delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the application for individual protection equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also resulted in a shortage of individual protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic offered daigus a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by the serious food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the storage and illegal trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been anticipated in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its important agricultural production, Northern Italy did not notice a significant decrease, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government members have released pig reserves to ensure sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers can store reserves for such emergencies.

Operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people under extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers were locked up at home in domestic or trapped provinces in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested assistance from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (with a daily wage) to unemployment. The Angus Reid Institute survey noted that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900 000 workers lost their employment in Spain since the confinement imposed in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowances and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies switched their employees to a part-time scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time labour compensation scheme was adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
The arts sectors of the spectacle and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, at the global level.
The arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their (often state-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed to a new order and their exhibitions, events and representations were cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also had an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the Christian Penitentiary period of the Carême, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend the Sunday fairs; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or on television while others propose to practice their worship as a drive-in.
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and the place of St. Peter, which emptyed all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Minister of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the sacred places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 League of Champions, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which initially had to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021". Casinos and other world-wide gambling facilities closed and live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has pushed many players to register online, and many online games sites have noticed a significant increase in their number of new recordings. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet as a replacement for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" created to ensure that artists are present, broadcast and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet memorials on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction from uncertainty.
Since the epidemic of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (although the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries also noted an increase in the anti-Chinese feeling.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
As a result of the progress of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians, who are the first to suffer from a serious epidemic of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia, and citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had initially signed petitions to prohibit Chinese entry into their country to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan made anger on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in the levels of racist insults and aggressions.
US President Donald Trump faced the criticism of qualifiing the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term considered by its distractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, demonstrators attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuators between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment related to the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "That is why God took his revenge on them."
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were afflicted by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "external waste" that should be "exterminated".
Many access-paying newspapers have withdrawn all or part of their coverage on the corona virus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory screening of the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or those who are asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined on the basis of the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
It is likely that this variability significantly affects the reported lethal rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharynge or exploration sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngated swings is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In the infected subjects tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory pathways by aspiration catheter, or a scratch (exploration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a reverse transcript followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR) and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test as of January 23, 2020.Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a clinical-quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency authorisation from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic device by RT-PCR from the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a three-year genetic test achieved non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a test bottleneck at the Atlantic CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only at that time were federal and local laboratories authorised to start screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorisation.The US commercial laboratories started testing at the beginning of March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of COVID-19 RT-PCR-based tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sample collection and treatment shall be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was announced to have developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On March 13, 2020 Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to carry out approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the Abbott system m2000. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses the isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests a day.A test using a monoclonal antibodies that is specifically bound to the protein of the new coronavirus nucleocapside (protein N) is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 bibliographic study concluded that "pulmonary radiographics have low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive even before symptoms occur."
Among the typical symptoms of the TDM are multi-lobary bilateral depolished glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and post-distributed distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the source of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincide with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. Radiology College recommends that "the TDM should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose the COVID-19."In March 2020, CDCs recommend the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and in the context of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (LCTs) or by test at the patient's head (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are able to carry out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For the PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin ponction.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction phases are required prior to the analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have properly informed the Agency and which, therefore, can now distribute their antibodies testing.
As of April 7, 2020, one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.Ending March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibodies test kits purchased by the country was sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has developed a plan in which suspect cases may remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients will break it inside, return it and later receive the test result.The British NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspect cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will not infect others by visiting a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 drive-test for suspect cases, a health professional will take a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The Drive Centres enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of compulsory health insurance physicians stated on 2 March that it had the ability to carry out approximately 12,000 tests per day in the ambulance environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to week 12/2020 and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a sample analysis method of 64 patients at the same time, grouping samples and testing only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, a 1,000 square metres emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese, or "Flight Eye" in French) was opened by BGI on February 5, 2020 and can treat more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for the COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid robot manipulator.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to review sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now the country testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were currently in the process of intensifiing the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory to be operational outside China.
Different test formulaes targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to respond to the demand and recommendations of health specialist screening.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new corona virus.
The screening capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended that the screening programs be intensified as a better way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves for ecouvillons and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "deficiencies".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or use kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will withdraw the kits that have given incorrect results, and will replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested to throw them into the Danube. Ateş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced that they were unusable at the beginning of April 2020.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieve positive results and the tracking of people who were in contact with the carriers of the SARS-CoV-2, produced positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death related to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, at about ten days interval.
Nearly half of people with positive results did not have symptoms, and all the detected cases were put in quarantine.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail stores.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools returned to the scheduled date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic using aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that have carried out the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethal rates, probably because these countries are more suitable to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten first negative samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories to carry out confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "positive % test" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that testes only those admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that testes all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, while other factors are the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to cleaning hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap to certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted orophecally.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by ignoring to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after the decay, after cleaning the ass of a baby or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you have no water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands to the ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after preparation of meals;
before and after having taken care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after having blurred or nausea/severe;
after touching an animal, animal food or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicines or providing medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in child mortality rates during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improved hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
The introduction of measures to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhoea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing low-income drinking water regions.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhoea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and costly way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality in children under the age of five, which is almost 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after having gone to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce almost half deaths due to diarrhoea and one quarter deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Programs.
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor adverse effect, common hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at hand, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common in health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key times of the day to reduce the orophecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (mitting, deflection), after cleaning the ass of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, in particular before and after treatment of a cut or injury, after tingling, coughing or mowing, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching waste.
In many countries, soap hands cleansing are low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 in 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of households were laminated with soap on average. A study carried out in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%). Today, there are several methods to develop behaviour and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. It is possible, inter alia, in developing countries, to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children can make this act habitual.
For example, the Ministry of Education of Philipina has implemented a "primary health care program" to promote the health and education of children.
Two times a year, combined with the daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated dentistry, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of the soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and to increase solventness.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficultly soluble in water.
An adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nevertheless indicates that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were strongly recommended for people concerned with their health condition.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptic agents or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which are resistant to many strains of organisms.
Therefore, even though antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, the latter may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, milk acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot and soap water is more effective than cold and soap water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies revealed that the use of hot water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-aqueous hands hygiene products based on alcohol (usually called hydro-alcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or disinfectants for hands) began to become popularized.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (MRS and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as mushrooms.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction by 3.5, log equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction by 4 to 5 log) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely inefficient against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcohol solution must be used to well wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstitions between fingers and nails should be fronted for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The American Centre for the Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends washing hands rather than using hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visiblely dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hands wash unless you have water and soap in hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by skin softeners and/or hydrating agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing softeners caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatites has made them more attractive than washing hands with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the benzalkonium chloride-using formulas have presented a durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, as opposed to alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use ash or earth rather.
The ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than brake it.
Like soap, the ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alcaline solution in contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hands should be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, following the following steps:
To wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap mouse on the hands by shaking them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, in the fingers and under the nails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Froster for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frotting creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and frotting longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with current water.
Washing in a stagnating water basin can lead to recontamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or free air.
The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, the wrist, spaces between fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and sliced nail vernis can accommodate micro-organisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin drought promotes the appearance of skin injury that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when the water of the rod and/or soap is not available. For example, to drain water from a drill or gourd suspended and perched and/or to use ash, if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a crust hanging with a rope, and a pedal to throw a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in the toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the White Paper Industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London) to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air-drive dryers.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on finger pulp and by 254% on palms.
Air-drive drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on finger pulp and up to 77% on palms.The scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment based on each drying method.
The air-drive hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment within a range of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer allows microorganisms to be distributed at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand-dryers, and hand-dryers have been compared with drying using paper towels.
Laundry of hands with disinfectant linen is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical environment became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that give reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
A study revealed that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical laundry of hands shall last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands mouse and frotted.
Hands must be broken against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, a hair brush can be used to remove them.
As the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wash with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the robinet (and open the exit door where applicable).
This prevents recontamination of hands at the surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in health structures is to remove and avoid pathogenic microorganisms ("gens").
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the inadequate level of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical establishments, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to a study, proper hand washing and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood infections related to catheters by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to clean and shake hands in the health field.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Organization can also be accessed on the website to collect comments from users.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
Equipment available in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with the regulations is demonstrated.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Indications" relating to hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (e.g. "medicines" or "antimicrobials") provides the hand washing agent with an action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to eliminate these germs prior to surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "scraper" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a robinet that can be opened and closed without touching with the hands, a chlorhexidine or iode-based washing product, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing them, a sterile brush to scramble and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
In this process, hands and front arms must be washed up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to shake your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, it must be avoided that the water on the front arms flows to the hands.
Once the hands have been washed, the hands should be dried with a sterile laundry and a surgical helmet should be worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic medicine for your hands before and after having taken care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of Staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved during the first 20% washing, and that there was very little additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
When comparing hands washed with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hands cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hands washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce the A (H1N1) flu virus and difficult Clostridium spores on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care establishments, it is possible, among other things, to train staff in handwashing, to make more alcohol-based products available to the patient and to send written and verbal reminders about this.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap hands washing is considered to be a costless and essential tool for maintaining health and even feeding properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal habits of hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robinets to wash hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building handwashing stations.
However, low levels of hands wash can also be due to persistent habits rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-washing and conducting awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, make known the benefits of this practice and lead to long-term behavioural changes within the population.
In order to achieve this approach, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective to increase the level of hands washing in low and middle income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting hands washing in schools, one can refer to the example of UNICEF's three-star approach, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be included in the campaigns to promote hand hygiene to reduce infant disease and mortality.
The World Hand Wash Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to stimulate behavioural developments.After the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
Few studies examined the overall cost-effectiveness ratio of handwashing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy living earned (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, a review suggests that promoting soap hands washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handswashing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who were born or soldiers injured in hospitals, was identified for the first time in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nurses.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetides smells called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases to actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means to prevent the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good handswashing techniques" have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The term "wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicate of something.
It comes from a Bible verse from Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washs his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, from Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in a compulsive manner to try to clean up an imaginary spot, a symbol of her bad conscience for the crimes she committed and that she has induced her husband to commit.
It was also found that, after remembering or considering an act contrary to ethics, some people tend to wash their hands more often than others and give greater value to handswashing devices.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of washing of hands highlighted in many religions, including Bahism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual bleeding of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washing of hands in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygiene purposes, especially after some actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is compulsory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls at Work
COVID-19's risk controls at the workplace indicate the implementation of occupational health and safety methods for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control at work varies according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, breathing label and maintaining a cleansing and routine disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of individual protection equipment in the event of encounter with a person affected by COVID-19.
OSH considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, moving to a very high risk if they conduct procedures producing aerosols or samples or handling samples of persons with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk checks for these workers include technical checks such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have become ill, have to take care of other people or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both with regard to the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (e.g. shopping outside the top hours or using delivery or drive services).
Lastly, the shipment of articles from severely affected geographical areas by the COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide to protective measures.
Plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also provide the necessary controls to address these risks and emergency plans for situations likely to occur as a result of epidemics.
Preparatory and response plans to infectious diseases may be recommended nationally or regionally.
The epidemic response objectives include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a comprehensive framework used in health and safety at work to group risk controls by efficiency.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective checks are technical checks, followed by administrative checks and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from occupational risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers. They can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls shall indicate changes in working policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (PPI) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help to prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPIs must be selected according to the risk for the worker, appropriately adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically carried, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced according to the needs, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, low-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labels, including covering their mouth and nose to rinse and drain, providing pockets and garbage, preparing for teleworking or at scale hours, discouraging workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others at a workplace.
The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they no longer have had fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrile fugitives or other medicines that affect symptoms. They also recommend applying flexible health leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to take care of a member of the sick family and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those who require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of a current community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person recently made an international trip to a region with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes both workers in contact with the general public, including schools, high density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a drive window for the customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the development of emergency communication plans, including the replacement of meetings in person by virtual communications, the establishment of stages of work hours, the interruption of non-essential travel to regions with active COVID-19 epidemics, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum to address workers' concerns, the provision of information and day-to-day training on risk factors for COV-19, and the maintenance of individual health-related health measures, and the provision of public health-protecting practices, the provision of regular work-related training and the use of equipment, the use of workers and the use of public-based equipment, and the use of public-based equipment.
Workers of this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board a plane, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separate the patient from the other by a distance of 6 feet, designate a crew member to take care of the sick and offer a protective mask to the sick or ask him to cover his mouth and nose with a mouse when he is nassing or squeezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Handhelds and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. For commercial navigation, including cruise and other passenger ships, risk controls shall include the postponement of travel in the event of disease and the immediate insulation and information of the medical centre on board if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, CDCs recommend short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of the community's spread.
In the event of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational exits, meetings and other important gatherings such as physical education or choral courses or canteen meals, by increasing space between offices, by grading hours of arrival and exit, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using separate hospitals for children with flu symptoms.
In the event of significant transfers to the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement forces carrying out routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by CDCs.
Police officers who must enter into contact with persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the use of adequate individual protective equipment.
In case of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before reuse using household linen or spray cleaning and follow the standard procedures for the confinement and decommissioning of used IPRs, as well as for the confinement and washing of clothing.
OSH considers that some health and funeral workers belong to high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become highly exposed workers if they conduct procedures producing aerosols or samples or handling samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Procedures to produce aerosols include intuition, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling of samples.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of human bodies with suspected COVID-19 or known at the time of their death; they go to a very high risk of exposure if they carry out an autopsy. Additional technical checks of these risk groups include insulation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation can be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
The samples shall be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSH recommends respiratory masks for people working less than 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filtration respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask only by screening staff at the entrance point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, support or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of aerosol production process, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a local occupied by a patient COVID-19 to persons directly involved in its care, using the EPIs necessary for the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without withdrawing it for the treatment of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the EPI supply chain and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECTIVE: [Covid-19] Reduce the burden and prepare the future
DATE/MYNTH OF ENVOY : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and strengthening at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaradery and charity that we have seen between all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable witness to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could no longer be grateful and proud to count all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me about his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipédia at the moment, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipédia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do, will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make substantial adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and time work in the coming days and months.
During this conversation, we have considered what we think would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
First of all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily work time objective will be approximately 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week until further order.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful for the mission.
However, the world is currently unpredictable, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, do shopping or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should be without saying, but we say it.
No sickness or paid leave required: simply inform your superior and help your team review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive to COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department that T&amp;C helps you and ensures that your situation receives the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we will reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and to our time staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours carried out under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and inability to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress associated with the world around us.
What we do can be awesomely congratulations, especially in periods like this.
Again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and can take the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things that we must continue to do.
The SRE teams, Ops HR, Confiance &amp; Security and Fund Collection (e.g.) carry out essential work that might need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting basic tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowening now will not hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to recover lost time" when the pandemic is passed.
We will not ask you to do overtime to comply with now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new targets and timetables where appropriate.
What about the PPP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to our new reality and daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the timetable for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their relatives while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmation is made.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by overcrowding caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They used a hospital quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork building, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington DC staff.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues established in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but could be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues used to distance work are aware that adaptation may be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to meetings of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider distribution over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have a agenda and forward the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and online exchange.
Dispose of a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or make collective notes).
Send an e-mail to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for snacks.
Join the channel #remoties on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We have explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed subsidization activities and that no one would be punished in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad with regard to the upheaval and relief of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
With regard to the future, the CRT is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Stay in contact despite COVID-19-related problems
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will enjoy this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
By then, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information in the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, significant workflows or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure the connection if necessary.
For confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at present, our work and obligations are likely to have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help they need, and to provide the service that everyone can count on to the world.
Our planned work will be there to wait for us at the time.
For the moment, it is time to help and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, that's why you need to protect yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself the right time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is an enzyme associated with the external face (cellular membranes) of the lung, arteries, heart, kidney and intestine cells.
The ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metallon enzyme containing zinc at the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal renal amino acid collector area.
ACE2 is a single-passing type I membrane protein, whose active enzymatic domain is exposed to the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is glued from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is connected mainly to the cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveol cells, haar intestinal enterocytes, blood and vein endothelial cells, and blood cells of smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the cerebral trunk.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
ACE clutches angiotensin I hormone and angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
ACE2 in turn clutches angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-PHe) carboxy terminated amino acid phenylamine and vasodilatative angiotensin hydrolysis (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also add several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrélin.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranary protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that originates from SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that originates from COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spicile protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endotosis and the translocation of both virus and enzyme in the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the start of protein S by host serum protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of it is currently being investigated as potential treatment. This leads some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help to combat infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended that standard treatment be continued with the help of ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results were less pronounced than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is pressivity as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the action time is 30 minutes beyond the 24-hour effect duration.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20, i.e. the identification of people ("contacts") likely to be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on tracking the geographical location of applications users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with COVID-19 carriers.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that ensures the tracking of exposure to potentially infected and rapidly communicating with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Department of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the application of contact tracking was at a advanced stage of development and could be deployed over the next few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications on TraceTogether's model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a georeperation application for patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and residing in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, mentioned several possible practical problems related to the use of applications-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only authorizes "official" or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concern about the implications of coronavirus mass monitoring applications, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations set out eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of control and monitoring should include extermination clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the COVID-19 objectives;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demontrable way;
Digital monitoring should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and remedies for citizens should be provided for in cases of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "relevant stakeholders" would be mandatory, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany also published verification lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistence of monitoring by eliminating the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geolocalization data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, thus respecting privacy (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated to send warnings by SMS to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to inform potential contacts, the government has also made localization information accessible to the public, which was authorized due to the profound changes to the data protection laws after the epidemic of MERS affected the country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Detailed information had not yet been provided on April 6, 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy-friendly solutions, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol.Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that the identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all correspondences are made on the device.
MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques in the collection and use of localization or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising their confidentiality.
On April 5, 2020, the International Coalition TCN was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would ensure privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a confidential encryption.
They also published the basic technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications respecting privacy
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to solve the problems of adopting the solution and continuing monitoring by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and later eliminating it in the same way once the threat is remote.
Repositioning a medicinal product (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reallocation or change of therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means conversion of a medicinal product approved for a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was initially developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these liaison sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, dependent RNA polymerase RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribosis phosphatease.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved medicines to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antipaludian medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydrochloroquine would be part of the four medicines studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State tests on chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorisation (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the AEA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydrochloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have indicated using this medicine "if there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydrochloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negatively within an average period of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In one study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients received favipiravir and half of the patients received fomenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that existing evidence in favour of the medicine is narrow and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in the severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral agents, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these medicines to find a compound that would be related to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Repdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that repdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumonia viruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one on persons with moderate pathology and the other on those with more serious forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York started azithromycin antibiotic testing on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial on Teijin’s alvesco (ciclesonide), a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is undergoing a Phase II trial with 200 patients to be recruited from severe hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults over the age of 40 who have been diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breast-feeding women who do not have an effective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients and students with the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral medicines that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many development attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the disease virus, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic occurred worldwide in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the requirements of the ECPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Targets of the main platform in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists said in April, 115 vaccine candidates were at the first stages of development, including 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, controlled against placebo and performed in several centres, while determining more accurate doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human evaluation phase (always in "preclinical" research).
About January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pine vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
About January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had started working on a vaccine, whose human testing should begin in 2021.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated process, it would take approximately one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a Quebec biotechnology company in Quebec, reported to develop a particle similar to coronavirus through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in laboratory, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "high amounts of money to enjoy exclusive access to the vaccine against the COVID-19", which gave rise to the protest of the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a RNAm-based vaccine.
The candidate for BNT162 RNA vaccine is currently in a preclinical test phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparing Innovations (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against the COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus carrying the total investment of the CEPI in the development of a vaccine against the COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
The Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an auto-amplifier vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the dispatch of the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of $275 million for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
About at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $192 million C.C. dedicated to the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national "vaccin bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that "Sars-CoV-2 S1 sub-entities administered by micro-naps triggered a significant response to specific antigens [for mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmaceutical School announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted computer resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia includes 4,170 health professionals.
The vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mouse, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need for level 3 biosecurity confinement measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SRAS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS were a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that existing SRAS research could be used as a model to develop vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were viral vectors, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have disseminated a conspiracy theory that the virus originating from the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in various social network publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases produce moderate symptoms, some develop to viral pneumonia and failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, thirstying or talking.
As these droplets are produced at the end of the day, they usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
Persons may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most infectious in the first three days after symptoms emerge, although the infection is possible before symptoms occur and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
The recommendations for wearing masks by the public generally vary, some authorities recommend their use, others recommend their use, and others still impose their use.
There is currently no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, breathing.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, walking difficulties and blue faces or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Less commonly, higher respiratory symptoms such as prolongation, nasal flow or throatache may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially had only thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the period of incubation.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may run up to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and studied. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDCs) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; out of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both exploration and salive can carry significant viral loads.
Speaking strongly releases more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors located in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (PCR) can disperse respiratory secretions and therefore lead to air spread.
Although there are concerns about the spread of sediments, this risk is seen as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before the symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly with what ease the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on copper 99 per cent.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salive samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with the outbreak of acute respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close parent of the original SARS-CoV.
Lunges are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme, which is the most abundant in Lung Alveolar Cells Type II.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spice" (peplomer) to connect to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury has been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during progression of the disease, however acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombotic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with adverse prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolary damage (DDA) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents tropism for respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE-2, severe COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, GM-CSF secretric T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and with severe pulmonary disease in patients with COVID-19.
lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported in autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcript of the polymerase chain reaction in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from rhinopharynge; however, a nasal or exploratory sample may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a coronavirus stem and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerization reaction tests (PCRs) to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (reasonable to detect active infections and the previous infection of a person) were under development, but were not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test near the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan suggest methods of detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-lobary depolite glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and post-market distribution are typical symptoms that are visible at the beginning of the infection.
Predominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolary filling) and consolidation can occur with progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings for autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumonia hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant multinucleous cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DDA) with diffuse alveolar exsudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
Healing pneumonia: organisation of exudates in alveolary cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Dispergated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding jumping places, often washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a mouse when heated or ending and that the inside of the mouse be used in the absence of a mouse.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after itching or prolonging.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered using a tissue in public places to limit transmission in the event of asymptomatic individuals. Social distantization strategies aim to reduce contact with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and revoking important groups of persons.
The distance guidance also includes compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no medicines known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected by 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "plating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when the hands are visiblely dirty; before eating; and after moulding, coughing, or ending.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for the hands of trade are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "a antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as humectant.
People are treated with support care that may include water treatment, oxygenotherapy and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of carrying the virus should wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those with moderate early symptoms of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission issued recommendations for hospitalized people for COVID-19.
Reanimators and pneumoniologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
With respect to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophene) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care where the completion of the procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an airborne insulation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the guidelines for the use of individual protection equipment (PPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks are preferred (facial masks).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, handcrafted masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is required.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized persons. Some evidence suggests that intubation can be avoided using a high frequency nose canal or a positive pressure on the double-level respiratory pathways.
It is not known whether one or both generates the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to hold on to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nose canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (they over 60 years, and in particular those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
One study in China showed that 5 per cent of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed respiratory assistance and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, approximately 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized persons are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices providing pressure control modes and high PEEP are necessary to optimize oxygen delivery and minimise the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Repdesivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although new medicinal products may not be developed before 2021, several currently testing medicinal products are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalescent people as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification.
The application is capable of detecting close contacts using monitoring data and thus detecting potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of mass data from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, the location of mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and persons with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of suspected persons with coronavirus.
The aim of the measure was to ensure that the quarantine was respected and to protect those who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020 Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect for quarantine.
In Italy, the Regional Minister of Health Giulio Gallera stated that mobile telephone operators had been informed that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
The Estonian president, Kersti Kaljulaid, has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor stating that "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but there is no data for COVID-19. In some cases COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-visceral failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and liver injury.
Coagulation disorders, in particular increased prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of people in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 subjects have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of post-mortem pulmonary samples show diffuse alveolary damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung looks like an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac lesions due to high levels of troponin or a heart stop were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had pre-existing diseases and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region could also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-numbering moderate cases may lead to over-evaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more inclined to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and had a 2.4 times higher risk of getting into intensive care or death compared to non-smokers.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong observed a 20% to 30% decrease in respiratory capacity in some people healed of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic injury.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in people who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of people healed from COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of latent infection rather than reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by human to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed that the oldest date of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first appearance of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time spent since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
By the end of 2019, WHO had assigned the CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for confirmed deaths in laboratory SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 cases diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in laboratory. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given period of time.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death/fall ratio is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) by April 17, 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the CFR rate that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die of the disease and the rate of infectious mortality (IRF) that reflect the percentage of infected (diagnostic or non-diagnostic) persons who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected persons develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people can have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different in both men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences in gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidity, such as hypertension at less advanced age than in women, could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected individuals were men and 72 per cent of the dead of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been selected to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with the international classification recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly called coronavirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, in China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended using the 2019-nCov interim disease names and akut respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
In view of the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are impressing care equipment such as buckles and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, complotistic theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and were rapidly disseminated online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
The studies failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY test to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, the sub-entity vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-entities of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on the spicile S protein that helps the virus to infiltrate into the ACE 2 receptor.
A third strategy is for nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an unsafe genetic code copied to the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were underway.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved against malaria, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral medicines constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on redesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines were evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydrochloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with redesivir for compassion.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to cure malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that the double of this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency authorisation at the discretion of physicians treating patients from the COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or fufenovir against the COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial spike protein that starts using serum transmembranary proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from taking these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complications at subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-chocal properties. Tocilizumab was included in the Chinese National Health Commission treatment guidelines after a small study has been conducted.
It is undergoing a non-randomized phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe form of the disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify the cytokine shock, it must counter such changes that are suspected to be the cause of the death of some affected persons.
The interleukine-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the cytokine relapse syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, the treatment of CAR T cells, in 2017.
So far, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective SCR treatment.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of people who have healed COVID-19 to people who need it is studied as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which an antibodies-based passive treatment can create a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cellular cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, e.g. using monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of convalescent people serum, consisting of the liquid portion of the blood of healed patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died of it after attracting attention to the spread of the virus.
