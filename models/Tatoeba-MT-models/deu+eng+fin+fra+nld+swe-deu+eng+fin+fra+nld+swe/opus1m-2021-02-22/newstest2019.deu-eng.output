In the afternoon, a surprise is waiting for our candidates again: they will deny the romantic Candlelight shooting before the MY SOLARIS not alone, but on the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, cooking, seducing - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend waits in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates are delivering shooting with people photographer Tuan and despite wind, girdle and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for the return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one once comes into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt the same thing as in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Frasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the now months of debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been delighted if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I have also assumed, at some point, that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I feel sorry that this conversation has not yet happened."
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14:13 a.m., Linz's professional firefighter was alarmed into a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was delayed.
The professional firefighter pulled out and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be virtually removed to the full, and fire shields had to be removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had infected a battery for the store at noon.
This might be the cause of fire.
In any case, the charger was in the field of the highest fire intensity, according to fire forces.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he is likely to be significant, because the owner had many collectors in his cottage.
Anger mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attackes refugee family on open street
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to piss off the children of a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live, as she apparently wants to cheat the children of a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you can see "Cut for luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and her children.
It instructs adults to trade children.
For all this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right now," is Lohan in the video to hear how she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the apparently angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an ear frog.
Under tears, the actress devours to how shocked she is - and she keeps the wreck.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in Japan in December 2014.
It should be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can soak material from its surface and bring it to the ground.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could increase further.
The rescue teams have not yet been drained into the deserted areas and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Head of Tesla Supervisory Board
At the beginning there was a tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk caused unrest on the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro car manufacturer.
The U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisor accused him of fraud, but now both agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla head withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain the Chairman of the Board.
Party Day of the British Conservatives
Guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The day of the party is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit-Hardliners, at the front front of the former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting about these names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is supposed to be called North Macedonia in the future, and the people will vote on it this Sunday - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went on the street in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is a anti-system candidate and is therefore at the forefront of the surveys.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Worker Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" editing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Development Director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobil Week".
In December 2017, the incarcerated and repatriated Audi-Chef Rupert Stadler announced that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/money combinations were expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "In early July we reached an important stage target in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and would like to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities submit to the Audi Chief that, after the exhaust frauds have been known, they have authorised the sale of Dieselautos with false exhaust values.
He knew or consciously ignored the manipulations.
Currently, the Sales Board Bram Schot is managing the company as a commissioner.
Due to the transition to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Scot is committed to electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is to go to the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to return to the office as President of the DFB in spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil case next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the ZDF's current sports studio.
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The leader of the association would find it "remarkable" in his own words if he had not "willing to cooperate in the future project" after the award for the EM 2024 football.
Grindel has been Head of Association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer trade business.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM leader Philipp Lahm is expected to cooperate in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will be advised in this role in the future in the Bureau and will, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience in sporting matters," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculations as to whether the Lahm could become his successor as DFB leader.
As a consequence of the affair on the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without migration background should become the integration messenger of the DFB in the future.
Currently, this office of the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without migration is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the topic is important, there we have to take care of", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Decrease right with half-smart weighing
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat.
Musculoskeletal and bone mass can also be shown.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
Doesn't he tell me if I've replaced fat with muscles?
Basketball League: Clear start-ups for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a significant victory in the new season of the Basketball League.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-master won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing party over 40 minutes.
New access Rokas Giedraitis was top-scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) committed from Ludwigsburg also showed an attractive performance in his duty game debut before 9113.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won at the compulsory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points of best thrower with the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 meters.
Last year, the Playoff half finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg enforced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the best shooter at the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a significant success.
At the basketball lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings overlapped the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweigers, in which NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day State visit.
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver followers of the Golden Movement in Germany and to proceed against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympatheticists of PKK or gold movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the inner city of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand policemen were in operation - among them also snipers.
The Islamic association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as the prolonged arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Bohrrufe and Horror Second
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more commitment to the fight against poverty and diseases at a concert in New York Central Park.
"Engage you wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival at night to Sunday before about 60,0000 viewers.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and support organizations also showed themselves at the multi-hour stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a fearful second when many viewers thought the noise of a falling metal locking was shot, feared and tried to escape.
Shortly, panic emerged, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people out of the stage.
"No one's trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to enter the Internet had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was a joy and applause from the audience - Buhrufe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, Flake, however, spoke in the US Senate Justice Committee for the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus struck many women in front of the head.
At least three women have brought charges of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects this one.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges, after two women who reportedly experienced sexual assaults themselves confronted him on the way to committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York about the audience.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's rejection
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the rejection of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overwhelmed a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Free for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, hadn't been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption in the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had led to a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he made the person protectors bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This is entirely true, whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or the support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah gold movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threatened several decades of detention.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain before the Turkish authorities: first in early September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirgast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the inmate journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
Although they came free and could return to Germany, there are still trials against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for humidly conversations at the teak of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests attack some beer, some wine or even more high percentage drinks to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few praises also drink courage for compulsory singing.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Coolest Day".
To the Munich, the trip to the high north did not get good at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely nauseous on it, the eyes only two small slots.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule One: NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sausage.
And spray.
And the round of egg liquor that ina throws at half three, let go too.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from immediate breads, fish breads or - probably most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the normally attractive cinematographer.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightly swing, it is not known so far.
Since she has been moderating the TV spat at the teke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and Unrat
The entry into the 36 km long railway trail in the Red Cupland in Treysa is hard to find and tormented.
Recipes against grassing vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly distinguished.
Screws, cigarette chickens, garbage and unravel, demolized garbage and now disassembled signs - so the entrance with a group of seats to the bike path on the hate hill in Treysa has been presented for a longer time.
A more than unfamiliar view for the demonstrating object Bahnradweg in the Red Kapchenland.
The topic is covered by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the Radtransport Officer of Ulrich Wüstenhagen City.
The problem has already been addressed in the Radtransport Advisory Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the shift of the seat group to the regular emptying of the waste tanks and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of any further activities," says Desert Hagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seat group is a regular meeting point on weekends to celebrate.
Not only is there a lot of noise, but it is also destroyed in the layers: the paths are cut out of the earth, the garbage is demolished, the signs are cut, the seat furniture is smuggled.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often,” says Susanne Klippert, ADFC member.
But the actions are only the literal drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for supply.
"Along the entire bike path, there is clearly the focus on the hate hill," confirms the Radtransport Officer, who is now concerned about the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this raises the threshold to use common goods.
This would, however, presuppose that soon a police line will pass.
Basically, desert hawks wish for a development of the hate hill.
It must be made more attractive.
In fact, the frequency of the bike path so far could be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," said ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne estimates the situation in the Asheroeder Street in Treysa.
There is no trace of aside on the hate hill.
In the case of rain traffic, it may happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the cultural train station: the "Kö von Hiltroup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in conjunction.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with eyebrows in the sympathic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke said.
In fact, soon it was a family with each other with coffee and cake from the honorary officials of the cultural train station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-living album in Hiltroup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a new one.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What did the texters see connected with?
In the places the Hiltruper Lake and the marketallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig gave the sole in his beating song to the "Kö von Hiltroup".
The cultural train station was also honoured.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints on their creation.
So Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can play a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: He with his Hiltroup skipper, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice appearance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the final again - and even sounded "rightly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltroup, accessibility of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District Offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event as a complete success.
Everyone is "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" at the soon very full cultural train station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that stand opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, four cards with keywords, which can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red foil - when you put it in.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can read nothing by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Cubs.
4. Festive".
These are the concepts that are now to be encrypted.
For we should not guess the terms here, but codes.
In turn, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" you should be advised not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "wools", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, as far as possible; for that wins the party if he succeeds in cracking the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "wash" for the cubes, "loose" as a contrast to the festival; here, of course, something like "Party" and "Prag" would be possible because he watched out in school and knows the window crash there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite side - it can get better together with any hint that the encryptor gives there.
Possibly mysterious, but not to be turned off, the rewritings should be so, otherwise you will make it unnecessary to make it difficult for your team.
The most cryptical on "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and thorough until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has first set up will be fascinated about how much feelings there is in this unseen game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "code names", which also steals an agent theme from a game of few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever's just about rate and not about victory points, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greetings and insults guests in the bar
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspector twice in the night of Saturday on Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper City of a passing police line, later he also appeared in the Upper City in a pub when he bothered other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic, he had to spend the night at Kulmbach's police inspection in the prison cell.
In a nude state, he must also be responsible for the use of symbols of non-constitutional organisations.
Working work Pressive was home of the Schubloks
For decades the railway operation in Pressig was the rotary disc in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers blew buffers, it was heard in a very pressing way," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't make anyone upset.
There the brakes also silenced and the Waggons knocked.
That was just a straight line.
Statements that are symbolically pressing for Dinkel's home.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain stretch to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres, has its skiing point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, earlier train and boot blocks were needed, which had their homeland in a pressing way.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a train operation workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, pilot and railway masterpieces.
"The heartpiece was the rotary disc, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a renovation in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional iron trainers.
Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - north.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a crew of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electricization of the 1939 route already minimized the need for train and draw blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights were ranked in the month.
Parts of the plant were broken down in 1982, the rest of the plant was broken down in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not considered better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
At Pentecost 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electricitying Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiasts here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later on.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Barrieres did the most difficult work in train traffic," says Dinkel.
Every misuse would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are here in the FrenchPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachstan or the Spanish woman Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russin set at number 13 gave up.
The sulphur now has to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach in the course of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
With great ease, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the "Round ums Walberla" tourism club in the context of the "Art and Enjoyment" series.
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor statement showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there for the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist.
Something surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
But with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his job in proven young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of the artists in the past and have been involved in flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Art & Enjoyment, there is again a 70-cent special letter brand designed by them, available at each art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted about the high presumption of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won for the musical engraving.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic fantasy and ultimately expresses it playfully.
It is made of metal or ceramic works, often equipped with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Luck tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colorfully brightened, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 hoods and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun blinking through the bush work in the background, the object works mechanically confused and loads to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate itself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
In half the course, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination images of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Windspiel-Performance" is the sliming through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Alps: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albtians also made their discouragement air at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to get away with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no sanctuary life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they picked up the MGV 68 albaths from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be full today," said president Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Alps singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had made the foundation party revive again.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
At the time of the 50-year-old existence, the festival was back.
An elegant ball was asked for festive clothing before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Meeting" in seating rows, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was recommended: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance area.
It was an honor that the singers of MGV 68 Albachten had the voice sounded themselves.
Passing to the occasion, happy songs were recommended.
Almost set: "A day like this, as beautiful as today".
Suitable for the exquisite vinegar juice many had before themselves, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hopen".
Once again, the choir line of Richard Homann was one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege, "he has such an easy way, it's a master's performance that he performs." By the way, this time, not only men presented themselves with singing.
Also the "Hohes C" lady choir was guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own riem.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
With the proceeds, the children of the Albatros Youth Centre are to be funded a visit to the All Weather Zoo.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The lifter is marching.
Three games, three Victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is quite right in League Three.
No trace of shakes or frocs, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite well.
"This was not clear, but we have already left the impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not discontented." On the contrary.
In the evening at a later birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was closed.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a setball.
"When they bring it to the goal, a game like this can get a bit better," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full profit to the goal.
"We all know who is in such a derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our neck.
I have seen phase-by-step quite good volleyball," Annacker hadn't had the 0:3 - and immediately passed on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents, does not seem predictable after just three games days.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredible level.
This is not almost comparable to regionalliga volleyball."The fourth league doesn't want to look downwards.
If the vest is not contaminated in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday, we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly says that the series could have had a co-debt in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Host Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left forever.
The series that made her a star could also be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many colleagues I admired took me to eye height," says Keller in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
First of all, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "droom ship".
For now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"If he liked this so well, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her husband then might have been quite jealous, but "how many men were also afraid of his conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he wanted not to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've moved," as she further explains.
She has always had the feeling that "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never really, even though I sometimes seemed cheerful and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong for a second time."
On the day before the Marriage, I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined the love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have gone far too naive to love."
The nightfolder, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the Zurich NZZ resort, has dared to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our falter is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the gray shine, in which a green carpet was immersed on the six-plate, blends it over charge.
But it's a film festival, there more or less famous people want to sunny in the headlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he tricked over the square to facilitate himself shortly in the "Aqualean-WC-Oase".
The public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: The need facility in the partnership of a new pavilion is a lot of effort to flow a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, it smells in the Lord Oasis for some reason to heaven.
So out here, on the other side of the street: invited guests who have enjoyed in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" just at the best level, celebrate the festival starting every year with a party in the three-storey storehouse.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known to come from the entire earthball.
What does an article about this festival do not need to be invented in order not to fall into a sleeve advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The falter binds a little bit around the sensors that have put a good feather on him, and two bully doorstepers actually whispered him generously in.
Inside, the invited people push, dance long after midnight to live music, or let themselves be imagined by DJ rhythms to which they shout each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite hips.
In the delicate food shop in the Souterrain, oysters are waiting for swinging mouths, next door is the uncomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain sprinkles.
And the hammer is: all the sales rules full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the reason.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studyes the sign at the rolling stairs: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the rolling stairs".
If that's two separate instructions, he's gone into the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry picks up a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not mandatory for this mixture with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who has been throwing this brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But there, between local reputation, casthesia and kitchen articles, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
His main performer shouldn't be far away.
And really: As soon as Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with almost sixty acting like a choir.
He's not caught, he's not beaten, he's not cut.
Especially for this restraint, liked to be misunderstood, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin for cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video already published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow-coloured tricot, fired by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican Second Litigist had defeated Leone's Negros with 2:0.
After the game Maradona called into a TV camera " Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old trains the Mexican Club since early September.
Handball: Liaison 1: ASV Send to last minute lead "destructed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball Association Litigator ASV, could hardly grasp: "This bitter defeat." His guards were "devastated on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
Yes, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over many phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we slept completely", the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The house lords quickly led with 8:1, even the early outtime that Bieletzki had taken did not initially fear.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
For the break, the residue was only two gates.
Especially Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met a different time in the phase.
After the change it became even better from the viewpoint of visitors.
After 33 minutes David Ernst looked at 15:15 and then the season changer was running almost continuously.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the predecessor was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Initiate the impartials in the event.
Bieletzki usually does not seek guilt from others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen cashed Mühlhoff was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit to the end four more times - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well at the back of seven men and threw them to the empty gate again and again.
Only can they buy a little for the accomplices.
"Now a fucking victory must come," says the restlessly used Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Clutch (1).
Bavaria: Missing woman for 30 years - police digging for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof) the police seek the deadly remains of the woman.
Staff buried a road on Saturday at Marxgrün.
To this end, the streets and several layers were cut down, as the police and the prosecutors shared.
New findings suggest that the missing could not have been buried far from their place of residence at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators also did not rule out a crime at that time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively with the Public Prosecutor after the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the explorers, through a ground radar, struck a frequencies underneath the road at Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained in the smell of human bones, the officials limited the job to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attacks on millions of Facebook users show what dangers are in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated sequences of letters, users should rather use pass phrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm it to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, the founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC were involved in an extrajudicial dispute on misleading Twitter messages, in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay each 20 million dollars, and Musk also delivers the Chair for three years, a position similar to the German Supervisory Board Chief.
He may remain the head of the board against it.
In the comparison to be confirmed neither by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also runs space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now being evaluated on the stock exchange with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share that the financing was secured.
This would mean that Tesla would have been estimated at $72 billion in total.
Later Musk came back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a chairman from outside, set up two independent members of the Board of Directors, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Enquiries: 46 percent do not want Merkel as a Chancellor by 2021
After the querels of the last few weeks, the GroKo collects several survey hits.
The SPD falls back in an interview behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time overtaken the SPD in the Emnid singing trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the Institute of Opinion Research, the AfD adds 17 percent to a counter, the SPD returns a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value to date for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Federal Day elections were to be held on Sunday, the government parties would receive SPD, CDU and CSU, according to Emnid, only 43 percent of the votes together.
This means that the large coalition has lost the majority of the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties are consistently 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
During the 2017 Bundestag election, they received 54.4 per cent more together.
The bandwidth of the other parties is also large: the AfD, the second most powerful party in several surveys, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP on 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards depending on the percentage of votes.
But the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 Federal Day election.
At the moment only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellor's Office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wishes that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are for a re-election.
A further survey published on Saturday also identified significant popular loss of merkel.
Spalted, the Germans also judge whether Merkel should again candidate for the CDU Presidency in December.
47 percent, according to Emnid, are in favour of it, while 44 percent are in favour.
As a result, 64 per cent of the EU's supporters would like a candidate, 35 per cent not.
Hang at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no romantic knowledge stories anymore - he should talk about pork at Aldi once.
Munich - In times of the digital "Fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintance for great love is almost an anachronistic romanticism.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pussy meat, boxershort button at the table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is called not to be a contact, but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We dare the test: How do women react, in the first message you don't talk around the hot brei long?
Here's the amazing result.
The Hollywood-Lovestory potential of the rule has when the happiness of love is preceded by an out-of-eye lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy still reports to his worshipers under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement to wish her to find her dream husband, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic pussy meat" in a unknown Aldi department.
She certainly earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for the belief in the magic of analog learning.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger island has been involved in the action "Cover against Polio - 500 Cover for a life without child paralysis".

The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be inhibited by vaccination, as it is called in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on form and fitness by Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us," said Reus, friends with idols, after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV broadcaster Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from Football Federal Liligist Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in any possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit and talk," said Eberl on Sunday evening at the TV broadcaster Sky.
Football: District League: Researcher Scout of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard to court with His.
Wordkarg, the coach of the VfL Wolbeck district ligist, first returned (innerly) to denounce the lack of performance on the green.
All the story.
In the meantime it's running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrical evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, during the last game time only sparkled by the elevator.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the appearance.
"We made the rooms tight and exerted pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and searched every individual for the party to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system changeover after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - almost seamlessly moved from the 4-4-2 into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front of him.
Wolbeck had significantly more stakes in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs, before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th), missed the leadership.
Nearly that would have been revenge when the SCA in a minute 41 hit two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL was frankly taking over full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed shortly.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, the fetch of the left side once again missed a fresh cell cure.
When old-rhein Chris Naberboomer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect open shot for the placers 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The puzzle joined himself and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues" thing with the right sleeve hit down left from the shooter's view - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes, they're supposed to be fucking long.
And then that: VfL Captain Florian Quabeck, in the 80th minute, unfortunately flew the leather in the criminal room.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory date on the puff in the 87th minute.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting location: four points after five match days - this could not suffice Trainer Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to make the first home victory.
Sturmmer Ante Rebic, who was in the startelf for the first time after an injury, should help.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing there was an accident at the airport.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn, there was a drama.
When a helicopter landed, there were turbulences, as the police confirmed against oe24.
The heli was captured by a windbow, pushed on the ground and came side by side to the ground.
Immediately, police, rescue and firearms were agreed.
With a great invitation, the troops came to the accident scene.
To be careful, the ÖAMTC-Notarthousian helicopter was also called.
Passengers only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one thing damage.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate boards
Thus, only 8 per cent of the boards of directors were female on September 1st, as indicated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and presented to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to stand different, otherwise international competitors will move past them," said Stiftung's Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male management teams - with few exceptions - are long overdue.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It's another business culture.
The small increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies is also due only to positive pulses among the companies of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
Although, according to Allbright, only 6.8% of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 per cent.
In the 30 Dax companies - predecessors in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "nul percent" so far.
Another picture is found in the Supervisory Boards: As of 1 September, there were 30.5 percent women - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"As many women were recruited annually for boards would have reached 40 percent in 2023," says the report.
Some even make man: luxury carross: Which manufacturer deserves the most per car?
The best thing to deserve is Ferrari.
The Italians take up 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profits.
Large cars, big profits: This slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
In the first half of the year Ferrari made 69.000 Euro operating profits with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 Euro, Tesla and Bentley even put strong on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are priced from an average of 33.000 to 38.000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros of profit before interest and taxes EBIT well in the race.

Fackelzug for opening the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a facket train, the tourist club in Abtswind opened its Weinfest-Session.
For the 60th time, the association will host the wine festivals, which are now rising every Saturday in October in the large fortress on the Rehweiler Straße.
To the start of the anniversary, the leaders moved from Wiesenbronn under the sounds of the playman train through the place to the station.
In the already provocative festival, the chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed guests. "60 years of this kind - this is a madness for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of it," Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later came out symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"Good that so many again have found the way to us after the abyss wind." Later, "The Trogliers" gave the mood.
On Sunday, when the Abdswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association, on the occasion of the anniversary of the afternoon, had set the drink prices as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine party will take place in the guest's house on Friday, 5 October, before a day later in the festive tent goes to the second round.
In Bonn: Notary car power in Taxi
An emergency car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passover has been injured fatally during the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best to save human lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn took a fatal end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been killed in Bonn during the collision of an emergency car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police told.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had driven a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then encountered a crossroads with the taxi that was driving at green.
After the collision, the doctor car slided against a lamp mast and a tree.
He recorded the passager who died still at the accident site.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from military forces.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor who was also severely injured was able to free himself, but the pedestrian was no longer able to help her.
Another emergency doctor called for this, but without success.
The three seriously injured persons were brought to hospitals.
The police determine, in close coordination with the Bonn Attorney General, who bears the blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we uncomfortable
After the disgusting exit in the ligacup, Manchester United now loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is expected to give to speak.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute in which the restored Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back to the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders remained standing, and all the time in the world Arnautovic spent the time shooting the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an already far-reaching performance.
At present, Uniteds City's city rivale Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos's large competitor Pep Guardiola came to an estimated 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team for the first time broke through the defensive lock of the outsider.
Sergio Agüero took care of the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former gatekeeper, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like at the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25 minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation shortly after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his sleeve.
After the Reds had started with an unforgettable balance in the week, Chelsea was therefore not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table through the Remis in the League.
Like City, the two London City Clubs also celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (to Watford) 2:0 victory.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played, had to wait for a success report against the surprise team from Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart misleaded an introduction of Alex Iwobi to his own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil took care of the decision with his third season date.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory in a row, passed by Watford and is newly located right behind the great rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave riser Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unschlaged at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and ranked the eighth place.
VW core brand missing: Paris car hall in the signal of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic, but all present: The diesel scandal and ringing for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies off at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the automobile hall 2018 they will show their novelties from the coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a major role in this.
However, the possible exchange and re-equipment offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should be an important subject, at least behind the glossy scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingold cities is to be marketed at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both of them have already been officially presented.
The iNext of BMW should not start until 2021.
In Paris, the new 3rd is central.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than one million visitors came.
At least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and tsunami.
Dozens of people are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured persons.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communications and transport connections are damaged, there have been enormous damages.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will still be significantly higher.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcycle drivers at the Peace Church in Eveking with a helper team on Sunday.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the soul-care concerns of PS strong two-cyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle goat service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of a month at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the bikers at the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikers had come together to do something different from ordinary worship.
Already from 10 a.m., the Bolides were placed in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First, the biker breakfast boots were on the program and it was allowed to be reinforced with coffee and cake or even with a rich curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were involved.
The sermon was held during the Biker service, Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical painting.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic-satisfactory," says pastor Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle goat service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Home Club celebrates a big party: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borish was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also woke great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his amazing spectators step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and left them filling the apples in the great tighters.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely cut mass.
I don't think many of the children could imagine how to become a tasteful drink.
But they could also look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped with nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stapled the a little bit of apple pieces for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical assistance, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farmer also had already filled out specialties.
So he opened his "shade coffin" and presented to the older visitors the latest spring whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up Hopeburg for themselves.
Actors of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited some stations to short-term games.
The home club will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, however, Gragor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargel village the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious due to the topic: finally, milk will be the subject.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth seasonal lead: "Cut situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 for himself and gave them courage.
However, much positive was previously seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professor Pirmin Schwegler and said, "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The further defeatless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to join, stands down with two counters and are a deceasing candidate in their current constitution.
In contrast, led by the superior Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first seasonal home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB-Pokal winner, who, after the successful general sample for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in his start-up debut almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never managed by Hanover's defense.
The storm hit after the World Cup showed with its speed and enforcement capacity why he was so valuable for the intrusion.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed by FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began swingingly.
Lucas Torró's headball, which was fake on the net of the gate, was at risk for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a challenging position at the last moment by the 96-defense by the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (Rücken).
The leadership for the house lords fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defended corner into the criminal room, Haller extended by head before the gate, where Ndicka had only to hold the foot.
It was the first Federal League meeting for the defense player AJ Auxerre who came in the summer of the French second ligist.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller fits his storm partner Rebic, who was able to tank himself and left no chance for 96-torwart Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breedenreiter responded to the weak vision of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxons now played a bit more courageous forward, flamming ideas remained out until shortly before the end, than the follow-up hit was still achieved.
The hexes were much more efficient there.
After a few hours, Rebic started a solo and then lay a cross on De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty gate.
For the Frankfurters, the rest was only a scenic race against overdue guests, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Wrinkles Despite cool temperatures, good mood prevailed at the October party in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Rider managed to open the 185s before millions of audiences.
Municher Wiesn last week with two beats.
Geises: Geising Christians Celebrate Holy Crescent
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on 14 September or on Sunday.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Church with the final victory.
The Holy Church hosts the shot Christ, who came from the 30-year war and on which the legend was to have shot after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed from the shooting wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage developed to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not completed until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds me that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance for the Geising parishes, the service was badly visited.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Church took place and with the final victory the church part of the Crucifixion ended.
For many years the Catholic Church Choir then invites to the Catholic priesthood for the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Sieger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to façades, roofs, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue to move up to next year.
After a period of time, the damages have been identified and the individual tenders have been prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existed a few years ago has increased, but it has also been found more, which was only possible through the inauguration of equipment.
The flooring works are completed, the natural stone works are expected to be started before winter, and one hopes that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Life Help opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to his destination - there were all participants agreed at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have lived in the home of the Donau-Iller Life Help for some time already depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and accessible access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans started about eight years ago, when the former US-Army officer building was placed on the test stand for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and had no longer been in the equipment right now," Bader said backwards.
In 2016, the baggers retreated to rip the house off.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life Aid Donau-Iller opens new home
Around 4.6 million euros of life aid invested in new construction.
The free state taxed EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
According to Architect Bader, the construction has remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign assistance.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Social Administration of Schwaben District, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile."
At the same time, the housing and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real luckfall because it is no longer acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new residence on the Münsterblickstraße offers space for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Stolz is Life Aid Managing Director Heinz on the eleven full-time workers, all employed according to tariffs.
Germany: quietly complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the Deputy President of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all nationals not to be disproportionate to East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day mirror on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East German worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but receive 15% less wages.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German Unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this hot dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongjang has made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
According to Moon's office on Sunday, the two dogs of about one year reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the " habituality of the animals".
The dogs with the thick white fur, spit ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship had been announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongjang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions, such as the 2020 Olympics, and to apply together for the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket ribs.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in a look back to the last hundred years.
It is quite different from Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "Image Book" of Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - this is the inofficial motto for the working week of the Great coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not mantraly invoke the "return to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashers and other workers in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but that is it.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself again to its mandate - the ruler - we should not stop it with term debates now.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamags of the last few weeks will perhaps show on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the conflict.
However, firstly, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel upgrades and the law on professional immigration.
CSU Minister of Transport Scheuer wants to get rid of the car companies with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to technically re-equip older diesel.
While in the diesel crisis there has been an approach over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned law on professional immigration.
The SPD calls for a stay prospect for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "trail change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be a conflict among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be rebuilt for paresthetic reasons on the question of being or being none.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight, but always look at the reality of people.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus confidence can be recovered.
This is why the people's parties have to fight now.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visier
Does the Ministry of Labour in fact violate the applicable right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more closely.
"Effectively day and night" her legitimates would have worked on social security reform, reported an overwhelming Minister of Social Affairs at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
With list-pilz manager Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament through a request.
She assumes "that the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and, in no way, to declare violations of existing law of service before running cameras".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to liberate Har tinger from any suspicion.
Police is searching for women's leaking a street
Marxgrün - Lange did not want to comment on it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, it has been buried on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is locked in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to finally limit the relevant place to a few meters, together with his leader in multiple operations.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomalie was discovered in the area of the said road piece.
For more than a year, the Public Prosecutor and the Criminal Police Court have handled the missing case.
At Marxgrün, a bike path was repeatedly blocked and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been damaged here during the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia-Yearday
On Monday, the controversial Independence Referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But already before, it comes to scratching.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Referendum of 1 October 2017, collisions between separatists and the police have occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates with colour powder, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in the election halls last year at the illegal referendum.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separated, reported the Spanish media.
Some of the around 6,000 separatists would have tried violently to break through the police chain, and officials were thrown with colour bags and eggs, among other things.
Six persons had been arrested, 24 more had been slightly injured, it was said, appealing to the authorities.
On Monday, the Independence Referendum begins for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision on the division of the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
Carles Puigdemont, then regional president, fled to Belgium in exile.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other separatist activists continue to be held in U-haft.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalan people.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratlessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separated without need
Red-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also at the FC Gütersloh, there was only a 0:0 indecision.
The final light and the third last, they uncovered 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a assembled ratlessness.
The first half was annoyed by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who prefered to get a beer or a brass sausage could do this with no care.
There was no danger of missing a torch because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) hit of the entire lot in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - opportunity had the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Gatekeeper forced Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border of the criminal area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced under conditions of injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters, targeted just over the housing and after an hour, the goods lovers also appeared for the first time offensively.
After a baller conquest by Mattheus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a sparkling shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) they laid after a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA Interimstrainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlener did not.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it did not bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to get out the positive: "I like to have played at zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against wooden wickede and that although our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensively "plunged everything so a little" against a team, "which only wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel that we could get a countergate," said Daut.
However, as a viewer, his suffering did not feel that his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too difficult for that.
Rear fields crop thanks market: Fortunately there are enough creimers
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are delighted from the Reckenfelder table issuer for which these donations are intended.
The honoraries assure: "These donations remain also in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky appeared brightly blue, while the place was still slightly empty, but this should still change over the day.
Because: "Here it's so nicely cozy, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a regular prise of humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term for the couple Brockmann, who would actually be weighted against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's enough creimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain between the musical visitors becoming more and more.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung later.
"Simply great", Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is delighted about the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"There shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those in the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful painting - here's something going.
The Maykranz was then taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firefighter and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decorative saws.
Furnishing works, beer lid with rear field motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A specialty offered three rear field Imker: "Rear field honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty in it.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, as good the cake tasted.
It is the company that the visitors then left to stay long until the evening hours, even without stage program that there is not at the autumn party.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skateanlage
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably hardly been able to promote the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of WN.
At least one case has been reported to the police for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were spoken on signs, among other things at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that, after the professional election fair on September 19th, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertising sign at the stairs up to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at that time apparently had been left "only" with an edding, it could have been removed easily.
"A few days later, however, it was back there, sprayed up this time," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that on the table several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned.
When the skate plant is built, it is also intended to be realised by sponsors.
There are commitments already, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the shamed table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateanlage.
After the old one had been degraded at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted majority for the fire park.
However, this idea was not transposed - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnout followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then had the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Engaging in air navigation is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European airline chaos in summer, German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," said the Head of the Air Safety Trade Union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-standing staff need for European air navigation, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for ready-trained lots is empty across Europe.
Alone in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt on Friday, representatives of the Bundes, the countries, air navigation, airlines and airports meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not be done without us," said the GdF head, who has many members in the German air navigation company.
Maas again made the EU Commission's statements responsible for the Lottery mixes.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running by 2019 would have been far too low.
The resulting cost forecasts and staff savings in national air navigation services are now fully linked to operational operations.
Mr Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not tighten air" air traffic controls.
At present, EU rules would be agreed by 2024 and further reinforcements would be feared.
The EU is exposed to constant lobby printing by the airlines.
"Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now harvested exactly what they have sowed themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high costs of delays would lead to a rethink of the airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Navigation (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 Lottery students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet associated with it.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voting for Group Reconstruction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interimschef Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees face this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be combined with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: violence against demos by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have led to violent conflicts with numerous injured persons.
According to the city administration, on Saturday, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered together, as well as about 6,000 defenders of independence.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a great injunction.
However, according to the military forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through security locking.
They would have attacked the officials with color and shots.
According to the information, there were also rankings between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honour the colleagues who had conducted almost exactly a year ago against the Independence Referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were just demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come to protest here?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to state his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is in favour of exercising our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the police assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data from British Minister
A security gap in a mobile app has led to the temporary access of personal data from ministers and representatives of the British Conservative Tory Party on Saturday to everyone.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the panne became known a day before the Tory Parteitag in Birmingham.
Two people embedded on B217
The Hannover police report a serious traffic accident on Sunday morning on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the local exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The troops are on the spot.

Football: Juvenile Trainer praises after top party: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star storm "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive purchased star was also without its own gate the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does good," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early delay through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and first hung the worst persecutor.
The goal hunter picked up by Real Madrid first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took care of the leadership with a double pack (26/49.).
And Ronaldo, after a corner per headball, also carried out the preliminary work on the hit of Chief Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had only to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But Allegri, of course, wants to see the gates of the attacker who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record guards.
"We have to become even better in serving him," the coach said.
Best juvenile shooter is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven victorys in seven games are the fake series in series A. At 21 points, the Master of the past seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
The second table, trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not chanceless against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to go too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turin Coach commented.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel.
==References====External links==*Official website
The professional from FC Liverpool was involved in all seven league parties.
The middle field player also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flew off the square on the 2:0 victory of the Turin and was blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West took special attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for front brushes and question marks among the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time to publish his new album.
Now you can only call him "yes", the musician says.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, in line with the deceased singer Prince, when he left his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is no news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du"," says the rapper.
Football: Circular A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not heal from his disappointment.
This was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more gripper, we've put him in trouble as much as ever." As a result, the list of Hoetmar's shooting options is thin.
Grade two torch opportunities in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Football-Krisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two options in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from a peak angle to early leadership (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have increased uphus, but after great preparation of Krause he changed standing free.
The hosts had only a double possibility when first Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher failed and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69).
A fimeter of trade - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the gateline and saw red for this - could also not use Niklas Eilmann for guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stuck the ball over the line was the party decided (81).
"We had previously criticized ourselves hard, which was then different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77 Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Body), Turl.
Tower: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfußball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all." He probably meant the wing ring with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-white who appeared with collective offensive pressure.
However, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, sniffed frequently and moved from then His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had withdrawn from the relationship with three points.
Obviously, after a duel of two teams, one of them, namely albums, plays the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class content.
With comprehensiblely mixed feelings, GWA-Trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was our best seasonal performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2 as we stand against one of the top teams of the League over the whole game time, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top-Tor jager Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season date (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he placed on over the left side muster valid for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but such a player can't be completely removed.
"This was already insane what he did," Lewandowski met with jealousy the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven created the compensation: McGill's free shot from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhuter Hinkerohe through the long tower (45.).
After the change of page it was McGill again who achieved the compensation (59.).
Afterwards it went up and down.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nübel again shocked Alps (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann looked out (69.).
Despite the overwhelming number, Albersloh no longer managed to recount the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep detten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbucker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Fröhning (39), 2:1 McGill (45), 2:2 McGill (59), 3:2 Nübel (64), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80).
Yellow-Rot: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table leader was actually traveling for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: General Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire office of football bipartite Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media called for a joint letter from the Saxony Board.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former federal ligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few national guests whose departure to Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was invited to Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrities and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not at Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there.
Thus, academic director Udo Hahn counted on him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in Tutzing Castle there were repeatedly famous figures, but it was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective; on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" given to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings by mid-2019 have it in itself.
"The pension is not safe," says a conference title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - the Academy describes the "risking and fatal route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbary without limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war curses every human idea."
From structural racism in society to the scissors between arms and kingdom to radical change in work through digitalisation, the spectrum ranges.
Academic Director Hahn convinced himself: "A free democracy needs places where civil society can meet in order to find solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on 200.
Birthday of Karl Marx soon they expect a more visitor of the direction of capitalism-crisis, the others rather a trend "from left to middle".
How does neutrality look?
"We are 100% daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said student director Dr. Ulrike Haendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the room of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret girl, Teubners came up with gender understanding, not only with humor and heart warmth for the (sensitive) woman and the (sensitive) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitars used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben was sitting on the wing.
This is one of the male Sparring Partners, who sometimes come to words even until the end of the sentence, and another is a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also true, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, as it fits with the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought a paradox into the game: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, however, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
So Suverrüp passes over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart g-Moll symphony into a playful dance.
There were great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers gave Karlheinz little, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the president Heidemarie Markenbeck was not able to take an additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also one in Wolbeck.

The controversial Tech-Milliardär Elon Musk may remain head of the Board of Directors of Tesla, but must be chaired by the Board of Directors.
Musk also agreed with the US Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC to pay a two-digit million sentence, as the SEC announced.
Background is Musk's surprising announcement of August to want to take Tesla from the stock exchange.
The SEC rejected Musk in her complaint that he had made false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have easily corrected the number of victims downwards.
There were 10 people slightly injured instead of 15 passengers.
All have been released from the hospital now.
The French bus driver was staying at the hospital for one night.
He will be released during the day, said a police speaker.
Still unclear is the cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal.
On Saturday morning, the Fernbus had been steered unremittingly frontally against a control board.
Handball: Women's League: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems mainly with third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"I was actually very satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many gates.
We did not control them," said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many odds left behind.
The concentration in the conclusion made his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end of a delay, lay at the break with 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only at the end became the broader bank of the host women decisively noticed.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room merle clement on the left-hand side, which then made "extremely clever the crucial gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV East Bevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV East Bevern have again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second-degree VC Allbau Food, the blue-white won with 3:1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked on this," said Coach Dominik Münch, after a almost unprecedented performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first passage was dominated by the guests almost as desired.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice champion of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has accepted in two-seal but has not come into play.
We've been very busy with them.
Our opponent has raised a high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already conducted with 12:8. "Eat has changed the assumption to triangles.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food has sucked up, and we have been having a little bit inhaled," says Münch.
At 18:17 for the first time, the volleyballers from the Ruhr area had their nose in front.
While East Bevern at 19:24, four balls were still opposed, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the exercise leader was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the use of the BSV in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passages brought four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen to be the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed chance
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way initiating the great Ditib mosque in Cologne by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a squirrel in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be reversed with effort," said the president of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance of a common, reconciliational appearance.
"States side by side with German top politicians to underline the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The broad exclusion of the German public "has reinforced many reservations".
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break is finally again folk date time.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Home Club Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost exactly the day it was a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln eta.
No matter whether Stormtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is like always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old beaters," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites always friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his first folk date " birthday" with his consent.
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from Steinfurt's neighbouring district who played music with flat German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish-people band.
It's nice to remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Emsdetten folk meeting with his international version of the song "Fresh in the night" enthusiasticed the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend once again a cozy and humorous evening," says the invitation of the home club.
Whoever plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there in time.
The folk meeting begins at 19:30, but the entry is already at 19:00.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are making another step forward on the way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, Linde informed on Sunday.
This means that there are still permits in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - in the United States for the billion-year merger.
Lastly, there had improved the chances of an insider's consent because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved until 24 October, so that the merger can succeed.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the district association for gardening and country care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last foundation impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
Obviously, he was called different at that time: as the district fruit construction association Kulmbach City and Land, he was raised out of baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit farming association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit farming, about flowers and gardening at that time nobody thought.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive speech.
Fruit trees should sweep far roads, so-called industrial gardens in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A naturally close gardening, biological plant protection, village enrichment and nutrition play a just as important role as providing knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a gardening association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary, especially in the digital era," said the district president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect similar pleasure with smartphone & Co...
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with the Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the Kreisverband decides," added Landrat Söllner, stressing the special importance of gardening associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the county also made no doubt about this.
He conducted the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was put in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"The nature has persisted, it was already in front of us and we have to focus on it," argued the expert on fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is the incentive for the gardening associations not to leave behind so that our home stays beautiful and worth living.
In addition, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added that it should also welcome the new citizens in our associations.
"We have to stop the eklatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif closed the successful festive act, which was celebrated by the tower bloomers of the Thurnau music club.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister relays UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they make both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement and postpones its speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in ringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed his speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister would only speak on Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her speaker Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, she focuses on the re-negotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, had declared that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between Canada and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new edition have been held for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are now scheduled to be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would endeavour to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against President Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a trade fair attack, left the hospital.
The ex-legal military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived, after a report from the newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will have public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on open streets at an election event in southern Brazil at the beginning of September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations made movements against Bolsonaros racist and women's disgusting statements.
A number of thousands of demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economic metropole.
In the capital of Brasilia, protests were mixed with a statement by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for corruption and therefore was not allowed to candidate.
The presidential election in Brazil was held on October 7.
Haddad, former citizen of São Paulo, was well behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a key election on October 28th.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed in this - no matter who he stands against.
Bolsonaro is known for being hot against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He always shocks with verbal distractions.
Another time he said that the followers of Lulas left workers party should be shot.
Europe recovers Ryder Cup title

The external team of Captain Thomas Björn uncovered the favorite title defender USA with a toothless Tiger Woods on the three days at Le Golf National with great hits and a challenging team spirit.
After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed on Larsen's website.
At the death bed Larsen had been surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known for the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as solo artist.
He sold around three million plates in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen recognized Larsen as a "road boy" who was "for everything but in all hearts".
The Head of Government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoes factory: volume at pressure air hammer level
"Here we stand here, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the strength of a tiger."Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a rewriting of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the Chamber of the Civil Center Shoe Factory: Hardrock purely of three bands with another friend.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surroundings - all in conjunction with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are loudly visible the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is able to convince with the latest, unknown pieces of their own spring and the CD that will appear soon.
In front of the stage, the band is danced for the consistent and intense interaction of the band.
Although "addition" call is not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock, Gitarrist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer for guitar rock.
Not only is the eager, straightforwardly balladed "Take Me Home" characterized by the change of melodic passages to the guitarous rockriffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, since its establishment in 2005, the "The Ignition" quartet of sounds has played a special degree of familiarity.
Full agility on Saturday, the band presents its hardrock.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has a special stage experience is obvious and uninterruptable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoiced solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume is part of the genre conditional on such hardrock concert, of course: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the information from the mixed-pult team at the triangle concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 Dezibel.
This is, for example, at pressure air hammer level, but is still clearly below the controls of the "wacken-fesitval", pointing to the "The Inflammation" on their website.
Ear drowning 120 decibels in nozzle power as usual in the annual metal stitch in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not need at this rock night.
After just four hours, the three bands of harder, rocky gangs have long been convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and burned a concert evening with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, naturally in the translated sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead man in sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport there has been a fatal accident.
A sailing plane crashed on Sunday at a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Close to Mülheim/Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
According to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailing plane was crashed at the fair park at the airport.
The pilot had died.
According to the "WAZ", the student had been on board alone - the pilot was supposed to be a seizure.
The plane was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just close to a fixed tent on the airport site.
But a October party has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & Ride offer at major events at the Fair Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump blazes Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that Kim, the US President of North Korea, has been very well-knowledged despite the nuclear crisis, is not a secret.
But now Trump has made his colleague a true declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president became a new flame.
The tragic: It's a distance relationship.
In general public, on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the US federal state of West Virginia, Trump found almost already tender words for the half-old prosper of the ruling dynastie from Pyongyang, although it shows itself to be quite tough in ringing around North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was hard, he too, and it went between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also had political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, although critics have seen little more as lip confessions.
The fact that the affection for his martial threat of "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - does not seem to be for everyone, seemed to be fully aware of the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of this when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible is that?
That is so unprecedented.
But take care of him very little, Trump explained and then directed his finger to the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people pushing into this plundered arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, moody as well as sunny: Very varied and with a good shot Octoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city centre was blown out on Sunday.
For the first time, the October festival was not only held at the firefighter tower, but was extended to the city by the trade union on Sunday.
Refugees saved thanks to video from Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya by using a mobile video, allowing them to be rescued.
The group had turned the recording into its cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under risk of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here. We're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally expelled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya when attempting to get through the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he put himself in life at risk, according to his own statement.
One of his comrades had been beaten almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the conditions of detention would have been disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
IOM organises voluntary return of refugees in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year using the program, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now saved is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone-video help call yet.
International organizations have for a long time criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African State, which is overly controlled by militia, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her class for Monday, she surprised a breaker.
At 4:50 p.m. the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a steep to the ground floor or the front court.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen can't be said yet.
Convict description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker look, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please inform the Obernberg inn police inspector, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to last in a forest area in Central France for several days and nights in his car after he had stuck the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and released the missing since Tuesday evening, the police informed on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He now declared to look forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his land car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive searches, the man's stay had remained unclear for days.
Laschet advises the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) called for the rule of law in Turkey in a conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relationships between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns in particular arrest waves, the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important precondition for this.
According to its own information, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Mr Erdogan then again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved in a short-term building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it had to take place at the Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected it for political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the United States: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump will not be tired of stressing the successes in the negotiations on North Korea's denuklearization, the East Asian regime represents the conditions of more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a meeting of Washington.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking the negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The recent stop comes from the fact that the United States is building on compulsive measures that are fatal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
A disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there will be no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the Nord Korean Chief Diploma.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea to "force the knee" is "a dream of wishes of people who don't know us".
However, in order to build confidence, his country had stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed a nuclear testing plant, Ri stressed.
However, from the US side there had been no "corresponding reactions", the Minister criticized.
On the basis of the North Korean nuclear and rocket programme, the UN Security Council had decided three sanctions against the internationally isolated country on its own last year.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations to comply strictly with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel again to Pyongyang to discuss the termination of the North Korean nuclear programme.
HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, of which many visitors to the house of the open door HoT didn't get anything: white ceilings and flower jewelry on the tables and a big buffet waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving Service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with food.
As Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers, the start with the new facility was not very easy.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the evil surprise: a power failure had put the huge two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed of.
"We had to start again from the outset: we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone attacked.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"The kitchen can't be better, either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the kids and young people have put on their feet," said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen provided card tricks and other pieces of art to give surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW from the table
From frustration about the criticism of its own ranks, the chief of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essener Table had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chief of the NRW tables, Sartor said the "world on Sunday".
I've had too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tablen-Landesverband NRW, expressed understanding of the decision of his long-standing alternate.
Sartor took the sharp criticism.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who didn't know exactly why the Essen Table does that."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days a week, there's nothing changing about it," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor criticized colleagues from other tables.
The approach should not be followed, "without us, people in the city are starving".
It is the responsibility of the State to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of the Tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet shake told me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me so at that time.
Play SF Lorch 2:0-Guide - Gmünder Day Post
Football, District League Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after the end - Bettringen strikes Lauchheim.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Very different of the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly entered back with 0:1 but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to win with a 3:0
Gladbach plays two-time guided tour - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first seasonal victory (1:0).
(sda) In the first five league games, Schalke has been maneuvered four times with early counter towers.
Now the Domenico Tedesco team once again showed that strength with which it had placed its first place behind the Bavarians in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the Heimequipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparation of Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, the hosts subsequently preserved the minipolster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback Borussia Dortmund greets new from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had negotiated a 0:2-retreat against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half of the time it was the 4:2-winner.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) were similar with a doublette in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, which was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublette in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to be afraid of the Werder Bremen, which was already decimated before the break because of a yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unremarkable Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler made a curios throw-off gate that helped guests compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but not a misleading debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a lead twice, finally played 2:2 and was still waiting for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1:1 compensation with his second federal ligator.
Yann summer was powerless in the 20-metre flat shot of the Aargauer, as was the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa appears to be a Goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from the OGC Nice took place for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unschlaged Werder Bremen maneuvered itself against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgarter counter concluded by the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis with his first seasonal meeting, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb was thrown up after a tricot row against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back to the game through a curious launch gate (68.), a quarter hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters acting in overwhelming numbers back to the victory street.
Nürnberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens took the home team to course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether to change their country's name in Northern Macedonia.
If yes, the conflict with the neighbour of Greece could be resolved for almost three decades.
Athens, because of his same name of northern province, had been subject to a change of name and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future West integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrers in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian beat three retired women brutally and, partly, severely hurt them.
The 41-year-old asylum seekers randalized at the refugee station in Alsergrund on Friday at 2 p.m.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went on to pass and tried to attack those who attacked his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and walk the officials.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had hit three older women (65, 67, 75) with his fences at a road stop in Währinger Street shortly before.
In addition, he had punched the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partly severely injured.
They suffered haematoma, bruising and brain shaking.
The asylum seekers were also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police said.
It was brought to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered partnership of life had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" letter.
"When we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Federal Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD fleece.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals Kahrs had been horroring on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "cooled" himself on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he referred to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, couples of equal sex have been able to marry as well as heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hectolitre cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Citizens' Association of Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters acre around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, there were about twelve supporters at work.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schroer, President of the Citizens' Association.
And it also gathered so many things.
Due to the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a form cut.
For already in the spring, the hedge has already been shaved.
The breakfast that is always followed to work has also been a long tradition.
"All of them should remain with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canusalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old placed a perfect run on the Olympia track on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed Olympia Bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough rides on the site, and it was all right today," said the Olympia Third of London 2012.
In the goal he threw away his paddle from joy and stretched both arms victoriously to the height - well aware that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
However, the remaining six starters were unable to top his fabel time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspector mentioned the first attempt to break into a single family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the offenders failed.
The days will be shorter - this is what breakers want to use again.
So the Gauting police inspector mentioned yesterday the first attempt to invade this autumn.
It is due to the alarm system that it remained at the one-family house on the Königswieser Street.
It started when the offenders set their hands on Friday just before 20:00.
Although the intruders thought that the inhabitants were not at home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so that they took the escape without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite at Hertha: Picked up from reality: Bayern against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to be enjoyed".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small level of performance under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase to the larger autumn depth for the Munich.
"A week ago, we still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a bit of reality," Thomas Müller noted after the 0:2-loss at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that we're really annoyed and that's why we're going to get some gas on Tuesday.
For the first time for more than a year no own gate shot out, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, first lost the table leadership in the Football League at Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intense man-to-man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful needle sticks over the outside, have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the most powerful Bavarians are to crack.
"These people who know the FC Bayer know that we won't let this happen and we will do everything we can to succeed again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, with his losers in his city of birth he was surprisingly gentle and moved his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the lack of opportunity again.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still be positive before the country play break, the first intermediate conclusion of his term of office - otherwise the sound would probably become worse.
For example, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second Royal Class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also conquered to the opening AEK Athens with 3:0.
"Now we've caught it in two games, but we're going to make our gates again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost Pokalfinale against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same time, Joshua Kimmich spoke in particular clear text.
The defender of the law appeared in the role as a memorial.
"I don't think it's all bad, we have to work it again because we don't make the variety of opportunities and make the mistakes behind," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians even lay behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken over the top with a point of advance.
And so Kimmich, with a blind eye, at least positively appreciated that the public debate about the allegedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," the national player said.
It's good for the League.
DFB-Boss in Shot Line: Özil-Causa: Heavy Attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan advocates the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the line of association.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On various stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the Interpretation Holiness in the Permanent Streit theme of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President of State strongly criticized the dealings with the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the big Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Özil's personally sharply attacked Grindel announced consequences from the Causa in the Mainzer ZDF "Sport Studio".
"In the future, we must draw very precise conclusions that something like this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not support the values of football and DFB.
He had repeatedly condemned racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born and grown in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they have photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
Honestly, as her President, I couldn't digest that our two young men, who have gone up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil after the World Cup deal, which had taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to present himself to players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrants - that's not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
He does not see a basis for a return of Özil to the national team either.
As a result, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed.
"If one without migration is clearly involved in society and football and says, "The topic is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
In spite of his criticism of his person after the World Cup and Özil case, he will again be candidate for the office as President of the DFB next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do as well as I can," Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10:00 and 13:00.
The 75-year-old driver was first referred to by a lady on the red light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
He told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff since the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady on the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who would have come off the road and driven against a guide.
On the other hand, the man did not want the police on the spot and then ran away.
Afterwards, the Red Valley went home.
However, the pensioner has worked in his place of residence, where he has been living for decades, and he has raged a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant damage to the accident.
The 75-year-old made a bad impression and could no longer imagine much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 crews are still in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a federal military site in Emsland, 980 personnel are still engaged in the discharge work.
This was announced by the Federal Army on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stablely, the last 70 volunteers were withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of personnel was planned.
During the night to Sunday, an upper ground fire had been discovered and deleted.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was announced just a week earlier on September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would jeopardise adjacent forests and settlements through wind and radio flight.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde left after their wedding the capital church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered partnership of life had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" letter.
If we get married, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Federal Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD fleece.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals Kahrs had been horroring on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "cooled" himself on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he referred to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, couples of equal sex have been able to marry as well as heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Referendum on new state names started in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the exciting referendum on a new name for this small Balkan country has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters should decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
It is based on the same name as the northern province of the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If citizens vote yes, they will also give the start for the West integration of their country.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and to relieve people in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve people in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved if required by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplantation.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases, a card will be found at the crucial moment of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"Then you have to decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the sickness fund card, as the spokesman of the Federal Health Information Centre, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - per or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted for a re-regulation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as a donor of organs unless he or his or her family objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in the head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in the head.
He took part in the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 convicts.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany took third place.
The most recent member of the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest 74-year-old retiree from France, as Chief Judgmentary Ralf Laue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.82 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants came to the audience against guests with pocket calculators.
Wenzel greetings from lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greetings were in Bielefeld two years ago when they were 14 years old.
With terms such as superhird, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can start little.
"Copper calculations can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented computing competitions.
For example, the square roots of six-digit numbers are among the disciplines.
When counting versatility, candidates get surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here also the Germans would have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians often benefit, because there is more intensive and more effective calculation of heads in the early childhood.

Government wants to ban more extremistic symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.

This will significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Next week, Mrs Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the west: Polare cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the Meteorologists of the Central Meteorology and Geodynamics Institute (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - it could snow down to about 1,000 meters in narrow valleys, it said.
From Bregenzerwald to the High Tauern is expected to be over 2,000 meters of snow with 20 to 40 centimeters of snow.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become winterly.
Farmers are allowed to start on Monday with the annual kick care
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start with the annual knick care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have for about 200 years characterised the landscape of the forest-armed state.
The up to five meters wide tree and garbage fences are "wild substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect habitats that are scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the Managing Director of the German Natural Protection Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living zauns
The Knicks were constructed on the basis of a command by the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitations and livestock fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialized factory houses.
From that time, his name "Knick" also originated: By "circling" the branches could develop the dense, interconnected boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, around 45,000 kilometers of hedges extend and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 species as alternative habitats.
In one kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be performed if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he disturbs a light tree series that, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knick Care may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about location on site
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and the tsunami:
You were on the spot during the tsunami yourself?
No, I was at the time in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be inflicted.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, on which they are still due to fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stand in front of their homes, there are still afterbearings.
Because many food stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partly steal food and petrol.
The public service has fallen completely and the national government has helped.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partially freely running around and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information work on the island?
At the moment we have phone reception, but before it didn't work and we only got information on radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and others, of whom they do not know if they live and where they are, because the people were not at home during the earthquakes, but were on their way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for that, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit very many people.

A muscle breeze usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber breeze usually heals a little faster.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled hearings is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the ugly majority for the controversial judge Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators until Friday to report on the suspected incidents over 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama around the call of Kavanaughs, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during whom the lawyer was dismissing angry tirates against the oppositional democrats, the Senate's Justice Committee should make the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his initial announcement that he would agree, but required an FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the serious events on Thursday as "shit", initially contained further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in the calamity".
In this way, he said that the last doubts could be eliminated.
Later, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats in an election exploration because they refused Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, said a government representative to the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
The mobile radar equipment installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on the garden road from Monday, 1 October, according to the municipality.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Trainers Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first seasonal victory against Mainz.
The relief on scalp is great after the first seasonal victory.
Nevertheless, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
It wasn't different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the king's blues had succeeded in bringing the short 1:0 against the Rhine heathen over time and thus the first seasonal victory under the roof and trade.
In fact, it could have happened differently.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11 to the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In sum, the first half-time was good, both playful and pressing.", with increasing playing time apparently, the head played an increasingly important role.
Don't really create headball rage
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, and so they always retired.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said the Creator, who with his headball matcher had no insignificant share in it: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's creation."
But at the end only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to start games over 90 minutes
The greatest defect of the afternoon: King's blue missed to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who met twice the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scalker.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for a repeated time.
"I have been doing my job for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters very easy in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject.
With a lot of gesture, hand-resistant numbers and some joke he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
At a table sits the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the big table and now want to vote.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether politically or left-handly, but "are I for or against an open society?", he emphasises.
At the beginning, the discussion round is starting more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on eye height.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because "only if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the subsequent hour of signage, he has been an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, was discussed in depth.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 lands
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the lands in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new Landsham-Süd region on the free market.
That's what mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 lands that offer the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former local model.
More than 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined" in terms of the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plenninger, the aim is to have the candidate rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
Afterwards, the award could be made.
In total, 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the area south of Landsham and four plots for multi-family houses with eight residential units are expected.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads are to be asphalted soon.
One single property and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Plening.
It sells most on the free market, 20 lands in a socially-acceptable model.
The two multifamily houses of the municipality are to be built according to Frick as a affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented homes funded by the free state.
Space for 200 people
Grove estimates are made on the area of the Neubaugebiet Landsham-Süd housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick there is the start for the new construction of a child dayclub.
There are three kindergarten groups and three crèche groups, as well as a multi-purpose area.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, to start the next kindergarten year.
So Schalke's Naldo "Great Sports" also succeeds on the bank
For the third time in a row not in the startelf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat not in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a sequence, but on the exchange bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the Brazilian almost two meters had spoken so rightly to the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players, after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all call Naldo for simplicity, joined and said, "We have to thank, coach!"
"This was very emotional, it was great sports," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-chaptain, who, despite his reservist's being, did not have any reluctance.
Truescheinlích knows Naldo, who was celebrated as the best scalker in the last season, that he did not get to the track of the trainer - but for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It was not easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco reported about the moment when he had told Naldo that he wasn't in the booth.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep on the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo.
And to whom the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself as an exemplary team player on the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its valley journey in August compared to the euro area.
The Shopping Manager Index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
In Europe, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday on its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, although the euro area's PMI increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still 13 months in a row below the 50-digit mark showing growth.
Only Ireland's industry knocked this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks were in the final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood survey decreased, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley journey could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter, industry remains growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore abandoned jobs in the seventh consecutive month.
In China, industrial production fell more than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Sales Manager Index is based on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices will be raised.

Christopher Nkunku (46) took care of the mean 2:0.
Paris also succeeded in the general test for the second leading champions-league group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To the beginning of the royal class, Tuchels team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat in Liverpool at 2:3 in this season.
