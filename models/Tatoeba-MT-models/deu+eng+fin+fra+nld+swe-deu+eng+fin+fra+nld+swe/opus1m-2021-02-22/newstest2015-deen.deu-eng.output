The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his first important foreign visit since his election victory in May with his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Toko to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had observed it leaving a petrol station on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on Burgess Road before he drove off to the bushland where the officials lost it from their eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponds to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of failure to observe a stop signal and of disrespectful driving.
He is scheduled to appear in the Court of Justice in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
One man is in court for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read on a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, slept, and couldn't signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflecting on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"As trade unions die, the middle class jobs die," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I proudly present the Staff Authorisation Act with the Icon of Civil Rights John Lewis.
This banishing law provides workers with the same legal opportunities for discrimination on grounds of trade union organisation as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the national labour law to create a possibility for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation, to complain to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the backlogs that the trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remembered when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness that workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to association and to joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight urged David Eisenhower and his staff to write a constitution that would replace the fascism of Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions of each individual and every profession or industry is guaranteed.
Agreements restricting this right or aiming at reducing it are zero and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country discussed other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union should be protected - and that the trade union would then be allowed to participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies.
After these rights have been fired in America, it is indeed very wise to look at the American ideal again, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and hear himself in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a marvelous market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has grown in the past and resolved the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to shut down
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from which lawyers say it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was brought to the law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, and is scheduled to enter into force on September 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors may provisionally continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing for the judge shall be convened in order to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision of the youngest in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would have more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are evaded from a deceased law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five state clinics to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the appeal and also applied for the right to refer.
Louisiana is one of 11 States that have adopted similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that doctors' right of admission requires unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents are opposed to the fact that the measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient instructions, informed the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to no longer perform abortions, this doctor would no longer perform surgery, said the group, because of fear of safety.
In arguing against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions, while their applications for patient rights were still pending.
Diagnostic delays and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James made an online videohomage for her mother who died of eggstock cancer in 2007.
There is a higher risk for women in Australia's rural areas to die of egg cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where eggstock cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
The research manager Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
PLEASE STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing predisorders and the social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the diagnosis time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
In spite of improving telemedical services in order to cure distances, she proposed, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of flushed doctors to enable specialists to provide women more densely at their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in eggstock cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centers regret declining number of household owners
The decline, along with the increase in the number of household owners under 35, could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year by today's young consumers, following a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reaching the "core age group of garden products".
The report states that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with home spend for their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting gardens for park purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated £5 billion will be put into sale annually.
In London, where the proportion of household owners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is mentioned.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Senior Garden Advisor for the RHS said, "Container gardeners are very popular among tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to increased household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
He also predicted for this year an improved market situation due to better weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by opposition politician Imran Khan and priest Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter discontinued its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it back.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a mile away from it, they were equipped with sticks and stones with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharif's resignation, but he refuses.
The army of the country is now advising a political solution to the conflict, "without waste of time and without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
Opposition politician Imran Khan proposes Prime Minister Sharif to betray at the Parliamentary elections last year in May.
The protests were escalated in the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to press Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomas for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the oldest U.S. diplomas to obtain information on a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the manager of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the ones from the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that also had the most important secret service in Germany's vision of Ankara caused the Turkish government to react much more angryly.
Warning strike: Locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The national warning strike of the drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
The distance announced for 6 p.m. concerns all transport companies across the country, including distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main impact of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district president of the German Locomotive Guide (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main impact of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Chief of Police of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials in the city of Calvià to the Office of the Majorca Attorney.
The head of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption accusations by businessmen and Barbesitzers in the famous Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was detained in custody after corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees in the city of Calvià to the Office of the Attorney for the Combating of Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the angered nightclub owners said that the authorities' veterinarians' business had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen said to the court.
Let our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer, due to a viral YouTube video, in which a 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who attended 24 men during a tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the disorderable behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the famous alcoholic drink tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage had to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73.000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several alcohol-induced accidents, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FREHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy scenic and strong wind, which affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 21:00 another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already fallen down to Sunday at night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy viewers, including a cassette that began shortly before 20:00 and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The rainy weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19:30, but was hit by a slice of wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At this time, winds reached approximately 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing and finally started at about 20.40.
The delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible spectators.
Matthies thinks: Highest time for big networking
In view of the galopping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech skalt centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with a highly familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable weren't, all listeners would fly around in the house in a short time, and that would be much more retro.
Is it true on the Ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, tip errors: electronic) sector is the rule that today's world innovation is the electric scrap of tomorrow, purchased - obsolete.
And whoever has a tube TV in the living room today, for example, says only that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because ifa's intrusion at the radio tower this week brings us back to mind our absolute incompetence in electronic matters.
The lay, who used to dominate washing machines and CD players blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spreading before him with unmistakably ardent expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you okay?
What should we talk about with people who seem to be voluntary to spread such quarks?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been essential that we should like to network our house.
In order for the yogurt to re-order himself, the fire detector to tell us on holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful if we from the office to the air conditioning to our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, it requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly be true soon: we lift our watch, say you "suck!" - and at home the dust agrobot will run off.
It's crazy.
Everything runs out on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blurred," runs a industry scientist, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but nothing is useful because we are in the stove.
From daily practice we also know: when a new-modic device is really urgently used, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air shelters, while rocket and killer fired their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed in Gaza while the area recovered from the fights.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel drawn by rocket holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" childgarten, which was hit by a rocket, before the students arrived Granatsplitter from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a little scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident in Kibbutz Saad and a English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little weird" to go back to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire occurred last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and killer fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education informed that, for example, a dozen families had not returned yet.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city of Gaza, severely marked by Palestinian fire.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited cease-fire last Tuesday.
The cease-fire led to an immediate end to the struggles, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the abolition of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect discussions is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the United Nations.
Israel contests this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for that information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and mortar grenades on Israeli cities during the fights, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fights, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl contests NPD ban procedures
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl voted for the end of the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban procedure against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts out worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU country leader in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the vote on Sunday at a rate of five percent.
A first start for a ban on the right-wing party was failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection was also at the NPD tip of informants.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council filed a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
At the New Country Square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central first reception for refugees in Harburg breaks out of all seams.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were briefly informed - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to raise citizens' reservations and do not allow district politicians to contribute constructively to the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group President of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party calls for the Harburg District Administration to provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the first phase are the storm of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough space in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Home Homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are operating a two-parted market.
The figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, compared with 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was severely hit by the cuts of government expenditure and where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless further said that, with the spring start, there would now be an increase in the properties available for sale for the next months, which would undergo "a real test" on the market.
"In view of the continuing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise further over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and certifies that he is posing "as a field master".
This is not the style of the university, as stated in the communication.
For example, the Medau family had already been informed about the start of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "preliminary determinations or even decisions", but there were "preferences".
The extension of the narrow road to the castle which is necessary for access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
It was and is not talked about a nine-metre wide road.
The current stand is 5.50 meters, which is one meter broader than before," Pötzl explains.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used in the future by students at the university does not want Pötzl to apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
The Kinderkrippe Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and would lead the access to the park deck in front of their door, is supposed to "not be affected".
Rather, he thinks, "that it is not only about the children's crèche, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
So it's a lot more than the particular interests of Mr Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism by the counsellor of the children's crèche to extend the road would be justified by a "less natural spots of Coburg", "the reader can decide himself".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the crèche last week about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access to the new park deck should not be carried as before over the campus and the Friedrich-Sdrive street, but over the Medau mountain.
This would require a two-purpose extension of the narrow road at about one kilometre length.
According to the medaus calculations, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus be tenfolded.
About 2000 vehicles per day are mentioned.
On the part of the city, they did not wish to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt pointed to health problems for this decision.
I did not like the decision easily, it was mature for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," announced the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He thus retired with a balance of 167 national games and 576 gates for Germany.
Because the huge back room player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf held a "long and good conversation with the Icelander, who announced his frame for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasticed me as they will enthusiasm my long-standing fellow players and followers.
But I would like to be healthy for my club in the next few years, so that longer regeneration breaks are needed, which does not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear the end of his career after a tail infection in 2012.
He had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball League (DHB) with a cortison syringe, which had later triggered a strong inflammation.
One emergency operation followed and two further interventions.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional career and eleven years of national team career don't pass any body without a trace.
I have some health sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot surgery that took place in 2012 in short intervals, I never really controlled my blood pressure.
There are also some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that although I control my head, I can't deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the tricks are ripping, I am always ready to speak," said the double family father to the journal.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humiliated in terms of my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go right now.
In 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) he won the EHF-Pokal in addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League.
In 2012, he also secured the Europe Pokal of the Pokal Winners with Flensburg.
German economy declined by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This informed the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
Consumption alone stimulated the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
External trade also slowed down the economic growth.
Thanks to the strong annual break-up, a total GDP plus of 0.8 per cent is achieved for the first half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fiettenfahrer".
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through Münsterland with their registration.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and have driven overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland more closely in this way," the cyclists were looking forward to the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club home of the Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Further, the route, which was awarded for three different categories, went towards men's wood over the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were served on the road in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Senior organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 at hopefully nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend," however, the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Constantin awakeners unclean honest memoirs
It's actually more philosophical than biography, which Constantin Wacker, songmaker, Pacificist, politically safe activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper on 287 pages in "Munch and Warrior".
Not chronological, but more thought-fetches for thought-fetches, the Munich, born on June 1, 1947, wrote its memoirs, starting each chapter with an appropriate song text.
And he is unforgettable: from onania as a gymnasist to shop thief and drug use, he does not leave human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also includes abstract but even more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the Now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the bottom in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he has influenced not only the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the living man Constantin Wacker closer to the ascetic monk, which is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
But between all the high spiritual views there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, about battles in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride where he frontally looked for a tree.
Even there he is unfortunate.
Lenny Henry: My father never put me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19 years old, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is trying for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited many therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, just listened to his voice: "Stop with the crap.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went with him to the bar and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a casting in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at his father's time, he gained an insight into how life could have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, contaminated, deep stylistic labyrinth with flames and smoke and lots of smoking.
My father used to lie in the bathtub and then he could slowly hear how he started singing because he could wash the casting from himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ love testimony.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went bad at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, shortcut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he was taken by the theatre.
It followed The comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and comedies who have filled his active working life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was the only black Imitator/Comedian on television for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I didn't just have to grow up in the eyes of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, an easy entertainment program in which people painted themselves "black," Henry performed his comedy there over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to handle a big audience.
But this "for years award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parodie of black people."
Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties through the introduction of figures that both ridiculed and celebrated the British black culture.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show went on show in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among others as the chef of the kitchen Gareth Blacklock in the chef of the comedy series!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you're just bringing time around or taking a little place."
Afterwards came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first sequence turned around Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and considered him to be a domain of the middle class, white in tights and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't hurt if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right.
"It's about it, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge over 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This also came well, so it's like a great shield of the gods who say to me, "This is your destination."
He said this, of course, with a voice that was DOKEN.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been carried out by humorous outbreaks while he imitates people again and again.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're driving it in front of a wall.
I sometimes show up live in Apollo when I want to, but overall, I don't have as much as before.
I ask him if he's ever going to do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to shape a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up that again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actress.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiitian Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi followers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the Yemen Post newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the leaf, threatened with further escalation of the conflict, should not be fulfilled.
The Shitic Huthis fight for greater independence from Sunni-regated Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has occupied the Yemeni capital for just two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding country there is always bloody struggle with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registered officials to restrict "spiritual employees"
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically to remove "spiritual employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive wage payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service when he entered office in 2013.
In an audit at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost to payments for "think employees" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been communicated in a government message.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the salary list was further informed.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and correcting the salary list at both levels of government," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Landgericht claim 19.4 million euros of damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was announced by a court speaker on Monday.
The petition states that Achenbach has cheated on the purchase of works of art and old-timers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This would also have increased the agreed commission.
Achenbach bought value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school service for 44 years, 23 of whom as head of school.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his desire to see human beings in the student.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain of Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in Trautenau/Nordböhmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was already interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudet Dead Germans were detached.
Within half an hour the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how it swept judges into the superfranky Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To this end, Manfred Richter had to walk six miles a week to the next train station, drive the train to Bamberg, go to school three kilometres across the city and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred judges received a sleeping place in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a sleeping room.
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Mrs.-room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he acquired a three-room service apartment next to the school in the newly built teacher house.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From 1968/69, these were summarized in Petershausen in the city hall today.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and so the children and their teachers were able to acquire today's building from September 1982, which was extended after Judge's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then Mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the cost of the community, had built a working room and, at the time of enlargement in 1997, cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school friendly," judge remembered gratefully.
During his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter put out what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two types: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "It doesn't always work." Whether he's just his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students fought, he did not get a penal job, nor were they forgiven for aftersitting.
At the expense of the community, judges had purchased two pairs of box gloves and allowed the two counterparts to stand against each other, even if there was to be a veil.
For the benefit of the school, judges held a good relationship with the mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This led the neutral judge after his retirement to apply for at least the last candidate on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, the judge was chosen for six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bikers set stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists make rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is in itself nothing special.
On Friday alone, however, the number of rosts made the impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying trip enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radeln und Feiern auf neu entdeckten Wegen zwischen Nidda und Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, which took 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was on the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All sorts of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: the countrywomen from Ranstadt and Low-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, sweater, streak and cheese cakes that were wonderful to the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake rural women," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
At the stand of the Geiß-Nidda tournament, cold refreshments could be experienced.
The "Duo Bravo" talked to the visitors with famous melodies from operas and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He earned it, finally he has re-fixed already jumped bicycle chains today".
Now the mayor and the company manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the restaurant of journalist Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise at the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Tobias Hagen, the doctoral leader of the first hr4 race tour in 2004, was only able to speed up shortly, but he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pick-up print, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries and made reports with his employees and the 15-head motorcycle booth of the Hessen police, via three phones and a radio device, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists travelled.
The number of participants is slightly based on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are placed in hotels, in category II in collection accommodations.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up after half an hour: "Bye!
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved for goodbye.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a nice festive atmosphere and of course it had prepared tastings, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whiteners.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, CEO of the GTS Markus Hoßfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in their role as Executive Board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three showed themselves apparently delighted about the "much business in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
In spite of the sporting activity on the bike, the opportunity to move swiftly under the open air has been used eagerly.
Among the guests, citizens who were in good mood were increasingly involved as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Tens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly had established an organized criminal association and called phone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities of the Islamic priest Fethulla Golden against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian front, has to fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukow, head of the school in Slavjansk, visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful for them in their future lives.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, BBC might have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., to which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
It's supposed to be almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also sound.
She was recommended by David Cameron by Lord Browne, former president of BP, when she was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May I described the role of the president with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: inside on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest if things are going wrong.
This ensures a virtually unsustainable duopoly that requires a comprehensive reform.
But which new president would risk getting in, hitting everything and breaking up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might kill himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status outdated.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the forthcoming negotiation of the licence fees for the BBC is associated with special risks.
For the modest amount of £ 145.50 per year, the British public purchases the world's most important media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each one only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC rises again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The vision and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I nowadays get messages on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that lowering Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a decreasing comment on the democratic District Attorney, which was the focus of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of official authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account that rejects the previous.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't accept the Tweet and have deleted it," said in the later message.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets went out of Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the previous Tweet, an inferior image of Travis County District Attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, condemned for drunkness on the tax in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against financial support for her office when she refused to resign, which led to an accusation against Perry - which might be presidential candidate in 2016 - in Austin before a Grand Jury this month.
The text of the Tweet says: "I'm not always drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I'm gonna complain to Governor Perry when he explains it."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a Special Attorney from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the accusation a political trick.
His high-quality team of lawyers asked the judge responsible for the case to reject the accusation and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas was unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds to the State Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-handed watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing the election meetings in Iowa as fifth in 2012 during his presidential candidateship, Perry went into speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the housing market again to be "normal"
One of London's most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England was "returned" again to normal level.
Homes in the capital were hotly wanted and subject to enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage credits in June due to the widespread fear of a loan bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of Berkeley's high-quality construction company, said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal level of transaction since the highest level in 2013" and added that this offers a "stability environment".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the catasteramt, prices in the city area alone have risen sharply last year by 18.5 per cent, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student offers rose by about one fifth last year and were £423,000 at the end of April.
However, in the last few months, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been discouraged by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "pollution tax" before the general elections in May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which stricter credit arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in the mortgage grant in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected his forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, based on a already weakening home price awareness.
The transaction volume in London's most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by one quarter a year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the wish for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, since the amount to be paid for the sale of a date is more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the date sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual excise income increased by 40 per cent annually to £ 280 million, and revenue by 18 per cent to £ 1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Annual Meeting of the Company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley was expected to meet the current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts agree that the annual excise income is estimated at £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed in London trade in the afternoon at £23.96.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's performance at the 85th Oscar Award.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "explaining violation of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly acquired by Apple by a gap in the online storage system iCloud. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozen female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are so satisfied with yourself," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorious" contested that the photos were about pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are FEELLY, people.
Let's get back to the beginnings. *Wortplay is intended.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They dissolved, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved as a box that you have left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, intensifying, intense, distanced and perhaps a little scratching.
And then shake his hand.
Cratzbrushed he knew.
He was stacky, like in Igel, yes.
The last sacrifice of this stubbornness was a just beginning relationship, which had been much more promising for a relief of the lonely boring of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with uncircumcised hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough as Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a wet but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leak, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked snakes had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belonged to it all, and the garden was overwhelmed with weed, which looked like huge coalheads.
It was like the house from a pawn, both threatening and enchanting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the Longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn on the broken lodge chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had abstained from mind in the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing messages when the view of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to have at closed roll shops in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their original aggressivity, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was really forbidden - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolesed, as the word obsoless.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have succeeded, and how people choose from book washer-to-millionaire memoires, cooking books and love romans, they chose the ballades in the music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern started playing an imaginary piano and singing in a rough-comic serenade of Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without laying two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It hadn't been a very funny game since, and it wasn't a very funny game even now.
He knew that this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any of them before.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly prohibited.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only space for one "when" in life.
People wanted to be very sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Likewise, the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz about the half secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society, thankfully, agreed to the principle of group talent - thankful as those spared from fate.
People of African Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, as of nature, and were cared out with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community, took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks, slit plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WAS WAS, WAS WAS WAS WAS-- out of fear of being accused of burning, even out of fear that the flames would eat them next - had opened labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen-restaurants, kept in mind and became depressed with the inaction.
Everyone according to his skills.
Since she had only heard ballades, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung before her could ever be distracted.
Music was expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the noise insulation of the huge carbonic leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something strange anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shaked her head unfaithful and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her unpoiled black hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're sing it to me yet.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet aren't very close.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick angels are exactly the reason why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should've been weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often put himself in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm that was needed to get the intrinsic cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her chair, threw the console and poured down the wine they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except that I'm not.
She was sad to him, both because of the unnecessary discomfort of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebeled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dreadful after WHAT WAS WAS than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, pulled from kneipe to kneipe, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed them.
Dickkopf?
They'd have shown her a big fist if she didn't watch!
They knoop - knoops was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the non-significant love balls from the console - they first knoop and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the kissing itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt blasting, but the weight of his mourning surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They didn't know each other.
She watched him go away - as she looked at her companion from a room on the upper floor - a man complained of something he had invoked himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, embarrassed, defeated, without a battle spirit - why was that a vision that she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Some years before the recent events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood monitoring body, worked on a brief lecture on continued low and medium-sized violence in precisely those parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolition, was most expected, given the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"There has been a lot done, and a lot has still to be done," she wrote, "in order to weaken the innate aggressiveness of a people, who led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness was historically rarely felt despite the high-excitement ecclesiastics between the tails.
But some properties appear to be inexterminable.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The population is crying when listening to sentimental ballades, getting drunk of stories about overcome difficulties and claiming to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still not only the former brutality keeps the rural communities and our urban structures in hand, but there are also evidence of the emergence of a new and impossible dispute at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nuss tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you lesbian?
Once again Esme referred to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a job without prejudice.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, may occasionally distort results, as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "remaining" and "ruthless" could be interpreted by others as an expression of natural power and vitality.
If one continues to travel around what is done, WHEN IT IS, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country's vital life.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED drawing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of the year.
Smile to your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to Balladen, visit Musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want," Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her superior had finally spoken, "and I don't say anything but that we haven't been healed as effectively as we pretend ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in this way how we repeat the mistakes that have not been made before what has been done, WHEN it has been done.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we leave our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angel's patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you call actions "fellow" that our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far when you say that they have left out their "rage" and their "distrust" to "others".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are talking about "we" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"As we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing left to say about this - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be attributed, no debt has to be paid if such an erasure would be appropriate and if there was a way to eliminate it.
But what does the past mean if we don't learn from it?
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can say something about that...
Luther Rabinowitz put his pyramid together.
"I will remember her report," he said and resigned her.
The next day, as usual, when she went to work, she was driven by a motorcycle driver who, as described by Passengers, had driven on foot in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup d'État is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup d'État to crash the government and said they were being prosecuted against policemen who were accused of the arms of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country had surrounded his home and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after he had reported of threats of murder.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was in fact no coup d'État, but that the military reacted to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armed forces were approaching.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defence forces acted after he had received several secret service reports that within the police acted some elements that actually wanted to weaponize some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a crash.
"Although no one has claimed to have cut the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'État," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers would return to their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice-Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believed that he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his unity government.
He said his actions did not end up with the government, in spite of other accusations.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month stake
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down in August at the lowest point in the last 13 months, as a well-observed study.
The definitive Markit Sales Manager Index of the Producing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced break-ins in a time of increasing tension between the EU and Russia via Ukraine.
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with a delaying recovery in the euro area and for the threat of deflation at a rate of inflation of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week on whether he would consider quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by the UK and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the declining of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism are no longer taking advantage of Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, are also not calming," said Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to block the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fish incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economics Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the sales manager index of the production industry in the euro area from August is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to delay or even cancel some contracts, especially large contracts.
He said that it would become "all the more likely" that the ECB should finally introduce a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell tenth of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible settlement of the school, as the children involved in it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostages from Chechnya militia in a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror act in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible settlement of Beslan's school, where 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamic terrorists took children and parents, on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, this seemed to be the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgusting, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst suffering.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror act in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war which now causes Ukraine - and in which children like them die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she was just trying to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," Aida said then.
My legs were bloodshed.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier put her in security.
After a series of operations she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to be reoperated.
Some grenade fragments are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people, as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says fighting.
"This happened to me, and you can't change it.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the settlement will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online, when I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to the fact that something like this doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russia went to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day settlement in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Go."
Feared she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little child on the way, caught it by the hand and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out in the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was stumbled out and with leg injuries in the hospital, for their part, in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later flew to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to get worse in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top-open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the settlement, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and that silence lasted many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
At that time I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive at all or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turned his face off from us for hours.
Don't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17 bigger than me, looking good, intelligent and healthy.
I hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with all the body parts lying around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I slept with him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, different from that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the settlement became the symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Trost: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear when he ran around his life while Chechnish terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had stopped him for his first day of school before she hurried to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they all were killed.
Only my Georgian managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no one day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: Georgij's image (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookstore.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world, thanks to this image, feel our pain.
Georgij says today, "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years have nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September comes closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friends tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I completed school this year and went to a medical college in Wladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgery.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped at the feet of a murderer terrorist during the settlement, but he managed to survive.
During the settlement he was captured in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb fixed at the foot of a murderer terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the settlement.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - year after year - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Surviving: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the placement on the laptop
My pain is terrible and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm okay with the body.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never report to my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much stronger for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something like this happens.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he's not running sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the settlement, and that only reinforces my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift God could make me, but my heart wept for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life continues, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tsjajewa, 10
The baby that was so seized by a special operation command in security
Saved: Aljona Tsjajewa is put in security by a Russian special operation command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember at all the cruelties
In 2004, the world stopped breathing when the baby Aljona was worn in the arms of a Russian policeman from the Beslan settlement.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty kept her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous racket.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana that he called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the settlement and has grown up to a smart and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $ 350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and cameras have scene and recording mode to optimize the exposure time for the stupid underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Find digital cameras in our guide and reviews for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have a LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to view this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of recordings are made with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you get away from the surface.
So if possible you stay close to the surface if you make recordings in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important if you work with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they want to complete the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As an advisory anaesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pains of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and diseases were important to doctors, while the patients were mostly busy with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble picking up.
While fighting the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
"I want everything more immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually worried and without any reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out a X-ray examination of his chest.
He had only been skiing in the French Alps two weeks ago.
The results of the X-ray study were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an unhealable cancer that attacked the chest fever, i.e. the skin that overrides the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have previously been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber builder, which once was considered to be "pollution" but has now been recognized as mortal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s when industry voluntarily committed itself not to use it anymore.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - connectors, construction workers, roommen and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial dangerous substance from another time, it seems to be barely worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, today experience the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in the case of road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelia deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are now experiencing the fatal effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma is only developing after decades.
And the whisper of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are no shelter.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a merchant either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and peers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my fellows will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer this question.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
For Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioids die within 8 months of the diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be ill?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to occur, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been victims.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the parties often refer because of claims for damages, shows how far the messotheliom's whisper is already spread.
In June this year Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, that Janice Allen had diligently exposed asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom before, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe isolations, boiler isolations, even for brake coatings in cars.
It is less mortal than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with potential deaths.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (krokodolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the unique high mesotheliomrates."

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study by the parties concerned that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment without known suspension by work or in the house."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
Looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unconsciously exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service chains and pipes were contaminated with asbestos behind the committee rooms of Parliament, whose deadly fibers could be thrusted up by something as harmless as "heavy air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than in the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never determine the contact with asbestos exactly is Graham Abbott, a general doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbot suspects he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've worked on, and the data.
What he remembers is the day early in December 2009, when he had such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was operating late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had a squirrel.
It suddenly came.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make a ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest fever, the skin around his lungs, touched.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and put on Pleuracathethers to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints were not diagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his work.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient came with similar symptoms in practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not relate this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't been so worried at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was Mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended that he take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground cantines (such as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It is shown that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their buns burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame-resistant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed on websites.
And since then innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or shovel roofs, have normally contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that is included in large parts of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a affected woman was the debris of a gardener in the 1970s.
So take care of how to cut off your garden shovel.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have any more Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient was.
How many patients before him he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take it all up," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have any more Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly ugly because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is spinned up and the fibers are inhaled, they can attach themselves to the chest fever, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest fever and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, from which Andrew Lawson suspects it has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of Mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well in mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some think it's worth an attempt.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
You don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer does not say "to chemotherapy" very well, which "shows effect", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a single-man support and counselling office for the people involved four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he gladly appeared when calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that lasted four months and his life was expected to be extended by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Cardiac Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be forwarded, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients in order to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail inevitably, many affected people have another financial concern about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one realized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally contributed to their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "complete compensation" because Lawson could not with absolute certainty prove that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a speaker of the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesothelioma patients who strive to compensate for a huge problem of assigning the fatal asbestos contact to a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who object to claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the claimants.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for those affected by Mesotheliom to claim compensation, even if their former employers have no longer been found.
The law has established a fund of £ 350 million funded by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 to prove contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have granted to them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many Mesotheliom affected, that £ 350 million was a "very good job" in the insurance sector.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time hadn't gone beyond and Mesotheliom sick people could find the companies and be able to sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths, rapid action was needed daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation of which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is of course with the most important," says Abbott.
This is always seen in patients.
There's something that lets you continue.
If you give up, you're getting worse very fast.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind himself.
After-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's life-long.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychically very laborious.
You need to think about practical things - about money when I'm no longer, for example, or my wife to show how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and inconvenient.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reluctant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to experience.
But for Mesotheliopards such conversations have not been perceived by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) provides a terrible security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to government elections, demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong election.
This approach probably fires the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists launched planning and mobilization within few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us upset," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK returned the control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants to elect the government presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented the Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is direct voting rights for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly in hand by a closely Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicly effective protests have been held in Hong Kong for many years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant any real general voting rights.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central Anhängers had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within few hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action which should take place only if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday there were reinforced security measures in front of the government building, including police and barricades.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The attraction of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement as it endangered business - the life of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fear that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western Powers.
In this summer, activists organized an inofficial referendum on the rights of vote, in which 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school balls in the United States is now transferred to universities, where freshmen shows are offered with the private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxury travel service in the UK for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security component.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cuddle their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business spokesman said that there were no new bookings, since the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that despite the study fees of £9.000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as obsolete.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for higher education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are exposed to a crisis in living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest living conditions before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrival in the student home.
Women criticize racial and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants picked up their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, not shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, for the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and were observed throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shootings of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "thinks to Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez it meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find many people in feminism who are white and speak privileges in such a high-quality way," she said.
People felt forced to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express this.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed every day, but who are not considered as "woman themes" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I position something about how colorful in their own country are seized, the silence is drowning.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no denotomia between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the subjects of race and gender into feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor for Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for voting law could only be successful for one group: women or black people.
"They made the decision to apply to the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should come later," Hattery said.
Remembering such things, one with power becomes aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women got the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade to organize white women against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catches" with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Is it not great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Women of the second generation who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive drugs now try to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are significantly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on Rassenhema in America are amazed.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Spanish men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police took up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the topic as an essential women's theme, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the large majority of the work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a retrieval in women's organizations," she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free standing house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was also a pig who had laid his head on a sofa.
Real estate broker Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner's pet.
"But the photo was mistakenly published and has now been removed," said a speaker of the company.
In the exhibition of the house Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
Home sales provided interest in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey homes a new millionaire after lottery win
A Harvey lottery player is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper skiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profits provide conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could come.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a proper degree for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont only a few weeks earlier had won the mega win of $7.5 million.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat into the Gladiatorsarena
Not only the gladiators stood deep in the matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain viewers and the autumn cold, and were unenthinked by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful resonance of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the times of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust art of fighting in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men to the ring for heroic two-course in various Gladiator generations.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as legs on the left leg and armrest on the right arm.
It followed the "essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and worm, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", which met with throwing net, trizack and dolch against the "Secutor" and recently struck the buzzers to the ground.
Because by the swords metallicly together, the shields created and the worms flew surfing through the arena, that a fear and bang could become around the health of the gladiators.
However, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had a always attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era alive," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer's "Friendskreis Römarkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum" from the leisure park for one day was a Roman city, as mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greetings.
Finally, not only have the Romans brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Rests of them were also to be admired on the Roman Day, such as "aqueduct marble" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman mark-anal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once confronted the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew, "We still benefit from the knowledge of the time".
This is also confirmed by Dipl. Ralph Heiliger from the "Ingenieur TeamZwei" from Rheinbach, who introduced measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressively, the footprints that Wolf and Fuchs had left in the footsteps of sound two thousand years ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Bodendenkmalpflege at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord Business Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been found with a hinge for drying grains and for milling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained Archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of traces from these excavations presented them in a glass window, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a charming necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the Roman Rhineland then, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children took care of the Roman windmill game, similar to today's windmill game, or they wrote their names as the Roman students once wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman heaters Zülpich the children of Mosaik themselves were allowed to lay down, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaik and at the stand of the natural centre Eifel Nettersheim a heavy stone wheat mill to mill the flour for a flour bread or muesli.
With the original Roman passenger car rebuilt by two cold flowers, the visitors traveled through the leisure park and also passed by the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Römer-Projektwochen" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also join in the 2014 Roman Year, proclaimed throughout the Rhine, which is to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerships Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, we offer thematic hikes, lectures, cooking evenings and guided tours for classrooms and recall the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman Legionary will tell about his work on the acclaimed Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era and offer a fun teaching hour in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule is dedicated to the Roman theme during a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often but no longer visible at first glance, are to be restored.
In the Wachtberg Town Hall, a small presentation will remind you of the founding of the Berkumer Matronenheiligdom in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens Western Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major hit for the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go to distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic makes the West African economy a serious blow.
The harvest is crushed on the fields that are abandoned and the markets orphaned - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies have already gone to a distance.
"Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic crisis," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola will come on the market.
Liberia has been hit the hardest by the virus, and alone here, more than 600 people were victims of the fever.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease was premature in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, and thousands more attacked themselves.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies suspend their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly the affected regions.
The local dealers and farmers are also responding: few merchants leave their hometowns to get retreat.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are rotting on the fields.
The farmers don't dare leave their home for the harvest.
Food is getting scarce
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert for the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
That is why the population gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is getting scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods such as rice is declining.
At the same time, the region, which is highly dependent on international companies, threatens image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will in principle avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors could have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the tightened state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the at least tightened state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely tightened up by the high expenditures on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are also vulnerable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not yet been affected.
However, many people are already staying at home because of fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly declining.
Shooters Celebrate her 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50-year-old foundation celebration from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, preparations are being made for the 50-year foundation party at the Schützenverein Tannenwald from 12 to 14 September.
Planned on Friday, September 12th, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6:00 a.m., the big bullet shooting.
The evening of the mood with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam" is then in the big festivity tent.
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big fortress at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gau shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festive dams with their guides.
Festkapelle is the blacapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker took over the Schirmship.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" was born in 1907, when the association was founded on March 21st to "Social Entertainment by Exercise in Room Holding and Small Caliber Shooting".
The NS regime had led to the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 again 19 young men were found who, on April 30 in the guesthouse of Lukas, raised the "new" shooter association "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult initial time, mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the "Leininger" guesthouse with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports guards, which were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were sealed every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time by Rudi Meier in 1980.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, the membership numbers have also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" club was no longer able to meet the demands of a modern shooter association, the board of directors of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, Pastor Strasser gave the church blessings for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in club history was certainly the 44th Gau Shooting, associated with the solemn celebration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Shooters' Association celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Joseph Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen in 2005.
In many hours of volunteering, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting system at the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them to the latest technical progress.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sports services of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air gun teams, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen to the District League 1 in the 2013/14 round of the Gauoberliga (highest League in Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bockstechen, fasching and royal ball, club excursions and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race was about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyres crashed in round 172 and his evening ended.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart drove earlier during the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to make the right side of his car repair.
"I went into a good result today with quite good hopes," Johnston said, "it just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the sleeve and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver in a ashes racing race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had gone on the track during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that the investigations on the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart has to count on an accusation.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start on the 12th position, Stewart was shortly after the first 10 and was temporarily placed on fourth place.
After a reboot in round 122, Buschs resigned
Cars with no. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued to drive, but fell back to 21th place.
Rejoicing youngsters looking for dance
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Leader Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to comrades.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also make the full-day lessons to create at the continuing schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have decimated strongly.
Now more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20 years old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can enter the training hours on Thursdays between 17:00 and 18:00 or Fridays between 17:00 and 18:30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training starts regularly with a warm up program," says the trainer.
Subsequently, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore over classics to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the company is not too short.
"We're going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've stayed in the dance room too," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you could close friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Who does not play jazz dance like this, he can also sneak into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can immerse their teachings in the fields of children's/Jazz dance, Bambini balllet, video clip dance and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who wants Discofox, Longseed Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha and Tango can watch and participate.
Bulgarian prison overseers protest across the country
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher wages are also on a list of demands to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations last, the Director General for the Enforcement of Penalty, Rosen Zhelyazkov, informed the NBR.
The protest of prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the trade union association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned airport of Luhansk
In the Ostukraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue to move forward.
After severe battles, in which Russian tanker battalions were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army gave up today, Monday, the airport of the Rebel Highburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had already drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the Supreme Army leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists fired a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, the pro-Russian separatists, according to their own representation, once again fired a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed during battles in the Donezk region, according to the Russian agencies on Monday.
Ships lowered by the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed that for the first time, in the Asow Sea, two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard had fallen.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been fired near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards had been wounded, said a speaker in Kiev to the broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several villages in the Donezk region.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukraine contact group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an ambassador from the Oestrian separatists should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicise their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council establishing agreement.
However, the NATO leader accused Russia of "a broken break" of the agreement.
"Today we need to see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, "that they consider us as an opponent".
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine agreed on new discussions to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday,” said the Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union to send a representative to the discussions.
Due to the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Commissioner for Energy, Günther Oettinger, had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says Powerword: Toll will come "very clear"
Now the Chancellor is once again clear about it.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CDU's persistent concerns about the passenger toll have steadily worsened the CSU.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word from her CDU for the introduction of a passenger toll after persistent resistance.
"To say it quite clearly, she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU peak bodies in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not prescribe a detailed model.
The black-red government programme called "definite parameters".
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) "has made a proposal, and it is now being further worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU maintains its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to this, he had also spoken with Dobrindt about other ways of activating more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house tested its own concept to reward motorway investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts in the Cabinet against the lead minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to penetrate all the district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian President of the CDU country.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to discuss the subject again.
Resistance to the plans comes also from the CDU country associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is concerns that a toll affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for the CDU coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as failed in the face of the conflict in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the Minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignet obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be subject to additional burdens under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, in accordance with EU law, the model must not adversely affect foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often incorrectly diagnosed
A British says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK informed that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gang and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from feelings of deafness or pain. The disease is unhealable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew that I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never ride with the other children wheelshoe or skateboard and was often stuck in school because of my kind of walk.
Rodgers said that she was 13 years old after several operations to relieve her Achilles and stretch her feet, when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked terriblely.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and then slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this alone and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she was 17, she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined, and asked her doctor.
He just got up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have this, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT has been detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworksman since the closure of the former military training site
For almost ten years, no shooting has been done at the former military training site in Münsingen.
Despite that, every month, killing ammunition appears in the heart of the biosphere region Schwabische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they need to be blown on site.
An ear-drowning bullet hallows in the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since that time, the 6500 acre area has been the core piece of the biosphere of Schwäbische Alb, which is open on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the companies in Washington were not an exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent last year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 per cent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent.
Most of the increase in tax revenues is justified in a recovery of the real estate values of companies, says researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While much of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the outcome also seems to be true for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent over a year.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, since here the real estate taxes amount to almost one fifth of the company's tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, much of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations who do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery of corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 0.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported a lower tax rate of 4.1 per cent.
With 6 percent in all three branches of office, Virginia has the much lower corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia there are lower public and local corporate taxes and a better tax environment exists overall than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the government continues to reach its income targets next year, this law could reduce the State's corporate income tax rate to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington, so they pay more public and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized - in District, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than the overall corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general revenues of the state and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be backwards if the federal government's cuts of expenditure had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hope and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner town of Guangzhou - that is the urgent desire of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, Deputy party secretary of the South China Metropolis, during this week's visit to a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the discussion, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this concern of the Twelve Million Metropoles.
Guangzhou, also known as the canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, ward Li.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines to Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
After that, the official from Guangzhou attacked with shepherds, but with red wine served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao returns to German Brauco.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity order.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician showed himself convinced.
"The trade between our two cities is increasing."
At the moment travellers had to take the route over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The Deputy Governor of the Province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate acquaintance of Germany, agreed.
Closed partnership
Guangzhou's supreme vice party leader hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the main, but not yet in this function.
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been transported from the office for corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a countrywide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is enforced with hardship by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is very unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before joining his office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior manager in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers of Guangzhou belongs to those maintained by both sides, for example with an exchange of students.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the perl river is almost as strong with its economic power as Hessen.
Next year, she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was sent to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today proved hopeful that the 81-year-old comic would recover from her disease.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a communication today.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency on cardiac arrest in a hospital at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and closely monitored until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "severe".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market from now on, stricter environmental standards will be applied in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be given from 1 September to a label on which the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
New cars are subject to higher nitrogen oxide values in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the building builders: they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10,25 euros across the country.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was decided for a cool billion thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", like an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which betterwisser gives the (most older) games a painting of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken up a little bored, an example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not happen, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they'd rather sport than watch it, it's hard to understand the attraction that assumes watching others when playing instead of taking the control console in hand.
It's one thing to look a friend over the shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while she's sweating by resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a crazy guy shooting him in the head 20 times each other in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without control of the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick passages in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic era complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuosis, his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me already know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant video as YouTube Twitch could easily swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "do both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium does not show any signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as spectator sports.
At the Hofburg at the Burggartenfest there was a lot going on on Sunday night.
The concept of the organizers was right.
In spite of the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, it is estimated that 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
Temporally, the entry had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l light and fun.
In two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is to radiate brightness on the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was shown early on Sunday evening, when the first visitors to the Open Air opened.
A festival for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they did so.
Around the supply facilities on the Burggartenweise, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings had been made comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wiped with the foot in the tat, enjoyed cool drinks - briefly: relaxation pure and enjoyment were recommended.
And that across the generations.
While one of the white sands on ceilings at the beach bar laminated, others laubed at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the young man died at the Hopeburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But in the truest sense of the word, the volunteer helpers had to do all their hands to become the master of the rest and to enchant fantasy creations in the small faces.
The larger used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew made of saltwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he threw down on the visitors, especially families searching for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "performance on the whole line".
That is why there is no objection to repeating the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the referendum.
As annoying, he said that the entry had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organisator spoke of about 1200 visitors who threw themselves in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks'n'Rox stopped their appearance, therefore, indignantly.
The technicians were not able to create half a reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to saltwedel because of a tyre panne.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be delayed for the first time, but have to be eliminated during the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to criticise.
"Sorry, but you have just expected more for 12 euros," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You have, unfortunately, taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same time.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it's very good that some not only quatching stupid, but also really try to put something on the legs.
Hut off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
Now the organizers have one year to finish these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's Warmark shrinks
It's not what I expect.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be used in the distinctive construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the hull, known as Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new hull is to replace the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather plays, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Callenge swings kips
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her cold water was cast over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Callenge went painfully beyond.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket-Call that she screamed herself out of the chin.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circled so much when her cold water was cast over her head that she damaged her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did the act, my chest just stood," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is shaken over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the chest was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw that, and almost made themselves laughing in their pants, but I had to go to the emergency.
The 20-year-olds from the UK were sent to the hospital to get the chicken back into bed after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet censorship and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon retreat?
Lastly there was always dispute between the two wolfratshauser Burgvereins.
Now the boards think about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, introduced the project in French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgratshausen.
So far, the views on how to deal with the history of the wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be very different.
The two camps are now moving together: discussions on a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we should be able to meet," Sjöberg says.
In his view, all members of both associations would be able to regain their ranks in the future.
This means that there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath were looking at a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest until the last time, the Burgverein um Sjöberg stands at the forefront of the "exploration and experience" of the site.
Herbert Piffl, second president of the Burgfriends, was very pleased with the call, according to its own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been present to the Burgfriends.
A new chairperson is to be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
At the moment, according to the 74-year-old, the association has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have rested the association activities with respect first." This "this thought phase" was needed to "this time to consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president should then enter the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfriends could also make themselves an up-to-date mood image within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself doesn't want to candidate because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a wolfhouse.
The wooder wanted to cooperate with the project "but very much".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He commends Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
They are a tourist magnet by a high participation of the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to drive the project forward. It could be created a "all-setting feature" for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be eligible for funding through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I don't want to just throw the idea of reconstruction on board." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something in this point.
Their goal of documenting history first is "important and good".
After that, you could continue to see.
Smart ways to save on college books
Since the cost of university books for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smart savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick file A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, attending the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The College Management announced that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year for teaching books and study material, but that there were different cost mitigation options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The rental of teaching books becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university libraries, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about one quarter of the books were rented in the college book stores last spring, says Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in Campus books, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one for the best deal.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only one third of the price for which they will have in the Campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased for $239.99 from Chegg.com's specialised retailer.
Buy Used
If the notes of other or normal signs of use do not matter, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, Graduate at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors whether previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Rent
Renting teaching books is worth considering if you treat them in some way well, remember giving them back and do not want to keep the books after the course has been completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the terms of the business at which you rent, including the penalties that may arise for the writing of notes, remarks or signs of use.
Careful tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of conventional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for about $61 for 6 months.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Look around at all.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as you can be so sure to find the right teaching book.
And before an online order you should check, says Gault, if the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" has not become a cash striker
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million in his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" played only $12 million in his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz played only $14,6 million at the end of the opening week, while children's films like "Simply made 2 dragons" also disappointed the revenues.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality of the film could be the reason for the children's films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" to date for children's movies and described "lightened 2 dragons" as purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, for films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film start, shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year to at least 2000 screenshots.
The results are based on the views of cinematographers and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's jungle book movie, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this, and we must not try to follow the past.
Contrary to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved revenues with a streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, when revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics filming and foretelling a "core melting" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its dark prophecy could certainly contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hiters to be expected in summer 2015, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema casino at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed to streamline the lig classification, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis League has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result is that whoever has not risen has descended.
Thus, Göttingen's top class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the declining, but in the next season only plays fifth grade.
Four-class torpedo ladies, despite their magnificent march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC turn.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserves enter the new Association League, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttinger Clubs represented.
With the ladies the TTV Geismar plays in the Association League, the Torpedo Second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga South.
TSV Clinings, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC join.
In the District League as regional representative Dransfeld and the SC Wende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The District Soberliga of Women begins at least in Solstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here from the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the District League.
With each nine teams
The SC turn sends his girls to the small district league.
The district liga staircase of the SCW boys - there still starts torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regional Association, the two Göttinger Kreislich start with nine teams each.
In the West Staffel are Red-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Staffel, among other things, sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The Damen-Krissliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Nuringen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at the circle level.
Observing that none of the six 2nd Crescent Classes reaches the sole strength, here the innovative and circular board will have to think about.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend there were protests from NATO opponents in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall there to hold a so-called counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough followed the development of the weekend and spoke to demonstrators traveling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out from the Blue Mountains
TWO young busschwanders were put in safety with the rope wind after being caught over the night into the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 20:00 when they had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23:00.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man had fallen and had beaten up his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were aired out on Monday morning.
They were shipped in stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalate anti-governmental protests in Pakistan
The about 1,000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the transmitter resumed the transmission.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial department.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the Head of Government to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police informed that, about a mile from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it had come back to collisions of around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
In the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to Sharif's residence.
They call for the Prime Minister's resignation.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the mighty military had called for a political solution to the conflict, "without waste of time and without violence".
The Communication further stated: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern for military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests made by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri lasted since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri said something like that.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won Parliamentary elections last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in operation to protect the government quarter.
The demonstrators had at first endured peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to enter Sharif's residence in the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after the second seasonal victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grodig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday took a reconciliational end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the exit to the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was terribly important," confirmed Captain and Torschütz Steffen Hofmann, who presided with green-white in place three.
With the second seasonal victory, Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the country play break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Thomas Schrammel, foreign defender, who, with his glorious leadership volley from the sixteenth century in the 14th minute, made the Softs to win.
"I thought I would get all the frustration of Thursday and sneak him under the latte," the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel had hit on 13th Novmember 2010 for the last time in a federal liga party, that was still for Ried.
The first championship in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, it's something very special, I'm from the early childhood," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term basin blast, Schrammel returned from the left to the right defensive side and also made his business very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in the wrong way.
He has earned the gate, he has already made a few assistants for this time," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after more than an hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God, we have had some luck today," said Schrammel, who pointed to the separation of performance and results in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the gaming was always good compared to the last year".
Barisic even found that "in many games before was better than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this season in this stadium".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the reversals: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
For him not less happy: "We finally played too zero again".
Much work during the country play break Also, the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-ups, makes the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which have been very stable lately".
The country play break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and put a little in the physical area", said Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in its ranks.
One of those who think the break is particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He scratches himself for the team. He's over pain.
Just in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that everything is okay now" "We must have had a little luck too, but sometime the luck must come back to us too.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He said, "You can't always see it black and white.
We have not played as badly in the last few weeks as has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is okay now.
He could not challenge the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much right now.
At some stages, they stick to me," Hofmann said.
Grodig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid counterpart "from the category of magic gate", as well as the regular gate of profit in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly known by arbitrator Kolleger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough in a few phases.
That's where we've had too little degrees.
Interior Defender Maximilian Karner saw it like this: "It just started badly, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
In general, it would have been more in it.
Under this whip is resting
We showed a powerful tribe on our rhetoric of the summer series "My piece of Rhen happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the county, the pictured specimen is the "ruishing" above the underwhite brunn.
A hollow path leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes the piles, basaltstone piles and basaltstone seas.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there she stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, extends beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds an American mammoth tree with an area of over eight metres.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from underwhite brunn to find out which occupation it has with the retreat.
The result of his research remained the rather naked explanation for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, the goat flocks should have driven their animals from underwhite browns to the meadows that were hardly roasted and free of stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards who were exhausted from the rise shall have rested.
In the meantime, the area has gained its meaning back, because on the meadows weeds actually again goat flocks.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, because the basalt warmed by the sun is also a popular place for crusades.
A hiking trail leads from underwhite brunn to the tree, which is hiding a little bit.
Further paths are marked, the uphill direction and invite to an extensive hike.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a water castle, which is searched for in our next task, is rather rarely found at the height.
The mirroring in the grave already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have some historical buildings in the county that could fit the building counterfeit.

After a week's break, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office, Matteo Renzi, made the appointment of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy, who will be the successor of the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi sees, as the government-based newspaper La Repubblica shows, the appointment of his Mogherini as a favourite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the ever-increasing left party base against him, because Mogherini is assigned to him - although rather moderately -.
Against the Conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, who was appointed as President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk will become the predominant opinion in Rome in order to achieve political compensation.
For the EU head diplomat will at the same time be the deputy of Commission President Juncker.
The remaining agreement of the European Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Napolitano would hardly have mentioned the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as a "significant recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for almost two decades the Mogherini, proven in leading party offices and known for their ambition, will demonstrate the "normal challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Their party career began in 1996 by the PhD politician in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), who joined the Catholic Central Party Margherita in 2008 to become today's social-democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the 2001 election in the Left Democrats Party Council, she joined the High Party Policy and worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, known by studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, involving Italy with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today, which contributed to the over 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD travels, Federica Mogherini has a share of this.
The fact that the new EU External Representative has too little diplomatic experience, therefore lacks substance, is contempted in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's ambiguously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are pursued and defamed as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to South Europe, which also serves Italian energy security.
After Renzi entered office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first State visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake hand were taken in Brussels with annoyance, and they invited the Kreml head for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new staff will be active in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel worry free and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices attended primary and secondary schools and real schools before.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainers of all the years and trainers go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a whole day hike and rafting are on the programme at the Inn.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "stop the mouth and fix France," said Francois Hollande's most important allies.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "his love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet formation has been disappeared by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay at his side," he said with great applause.
As a controversial gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite the strong demands for a relaxation of the regime by Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economics.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "unified" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sprang sand into the drive, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant tombs of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without dresses, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one hasn't even survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She reiterated the reputation of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said she was confident that in pre-elected elections she would be a winner and ready for the government.
The ruling party in France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-handed national front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the term of office in Holland 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at Science Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and the record unemployment rates.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, conducts, according to industry experts, advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customer, while it competes with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, acts under the name Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 per cent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals approximately $29 billion and is expected for it in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been a majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino mixed group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in 2008 in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to the approval authorities, Genting held a share of 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the TPG Capital LP private equity company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise share 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A peking loyal group swinged near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, which allows only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking-reliant members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposing democrats to be elected and prompted pro-democratic activists to perceive their threat and paralyse Hong Kong's financial place with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's leadership fears that the calls for democracy will extend to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China's predominance over Hong Kong was presented in June, democracy activists held an inofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched in the city's business district and organized a sit-in.
Li's interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of the Hong Kong Affairs Office and Macaus of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced to meet in the afternoon in front of the headline office in Hong Kong.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom had no democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "stateliness talks" with the Ostukraine
According to Russian media reports, the Russian President Vladimir Putin requested the Ukrainian government to stop fighting against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and to enter into direct negotiations on the "Statality" of the abyss region.
His speaker, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of the Ostukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status with regard to Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev Government for negotiations at a high level with the pro-Russian rebels, however, is consistent with the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the outbreaks five months ago: assistance to the separatists in taking up areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to be effective in independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the State Television Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to rebel the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had inaugurated the Ukrainian Peninsula Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary shine of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who were attacking civil communities in the areas held by separatists in the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and during government groups hoped to be "captured in their illusions", itar-tass reported.
"We need to start detailed discussions without delay, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the South Orthodox people, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to stateliness must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to scatter fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia," Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the "feal interpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, contrary to the direct arrest of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in connecting the Donezk and Luhansk regions to the Oestrian region, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy referred to by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving Kreml in fact control over a territory that connects the Russian state territory with the Crimea.
The Peninsula in the Black Sea, which was inaugurated five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and casting plants that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukraine's legislation, following re-elections, should consider additions to the Constitution to give the respective regions greater control of their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebellions whose armor and revolt Moscow is accused.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the height of the eye followed a further rush of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered the Ostukraine across the previously peaceful region along the Asow Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took the hand, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point where there is no return," said Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide on concrete actions and the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers went to the Donezk region last week in order to support the inhabited separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, probably included by the Russian invasion in Ilovajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, told Lysenko on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian Celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not shine around his trouble about hackers who probably stole naked pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film city is thrilled after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The responsible hacker probably has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly also published due to an iCloud gap.
On the list are 101 Celebrations.
Ecclesiastes who had engaged with Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported that a news site said that the hack was "shameful" and that the affected people felt "shameful".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is not in a pool.
The film works Palmers include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ, "It's a disgusting violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a phone is nothing other than selling Hehlerware."
From a legal point of view, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, joggers and hikers attended the 8th cycle on the Großen Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for Cancer Kids".
The tour, which was a tour for one, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberurzler Brauhaus went on a bike on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily put the small muscle cat away, especially since his participation on the 8th wheeling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
Little pussy on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would've been out of...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper Ursula City Parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured in the early valley in the mountains yesterday and got close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the more than eleven kilometers of distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
For example, Norman Dießner.
The green politician from the circle day, red dress, red bike, who appeared in red, made something on understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is the destination!"), but then he proved to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the destination after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a rutch, as well as Nina Kuhn, the press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had been on his way together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about charity, that's what we'd like to do - we'd have done an exit today," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was descended to Oberursel in the morning to stir up to the height immediately.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had moved home to the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolling home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Friten-Toni".
For the head of the Upper Ursula Cultkyosk, bicycle tours across the field mountain are simply included.
With his 6,5-kilo bike he had mirrored for 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "ambitioned race biker".
He must be, because he was on his way on the "Fixie-Rad", although they're also racing bikes, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the footsteps to the summit, but also a jogger who had a carpenter with weights on a cordel.
Mountain Guard Doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who was equipped with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bolly and Quad, for security, said: "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sliding trail, only that he pulls the sliding itself." So the man is in some way his own sliding dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to the track in the morning in groups.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that the route to the Feldberg will be able to lock up to the safety of the participants.
