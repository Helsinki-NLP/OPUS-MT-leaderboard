28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The brother of the victim said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "Finally it went up with him again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a cook in Boston, had completed his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia KGO told.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a great heart.
His way of connecting to his family was to always cook us something to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swims with the power.
"With everything that went wrong in the world, he was this unhappy diamond that shook light every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD note phone under 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made that clear in an interview now.
"I'm always put in drawers or get sticked up from outside labels, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not want to be always perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are more cunning to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered Miss Perfect, as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, for example television with relaxed dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
She brings the question of the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect", says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is seen as a single parent of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are verifiable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a little difference with a trip on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, hunting at home at the fast galopp.
A kilometre at this pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the rider's career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournaments - was again near horses.
He was led with his family over the installation of the ALRV, he didn't even swing himself to a horse for photography purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was absolutely convincing.
The German sports aid gave the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid in a small gala.
There is no lack of awards for the sympathic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has already attacked him.
Longer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means very much to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the excellent athletes are the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the turner Eberhard Gienger, the gentleman Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nihmer, Judo Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schock Mehle and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society wandered into the spring stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that is what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US Presidency candidates disagree in tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
It will drasticly reverse regulation, and it is committed to a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has to fulfil certain tasks, it has the opportunity to open up disadvantaged people and needs money to do so.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost equal words.
The democratic candidate even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical tea party flare.
So Trump could still have party-internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in protected areas so far, and the Paris Climate Agreement is intended to terminate.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with its investment programme and calls for "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in the field of infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, do not both wish to sign.
At the same time, however, both countries do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should then be paid better, for example Clinton.
The current minimum wage of US$ 7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to increase it to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must rise, then he says that it should not be changed.
But the great debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is trying to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics think that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are in a large kitchen.
Each person has a baby that is no more than one year old.
One of them put their little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the table plate.
Until she finds out she's being observed.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is sector manager of Condrobs, a social aid agency in Bavaria, and is involved in the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say: Each woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a source of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons for the escape were: "Many steal themselves secretly because they don't see another way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced vision, murders of honor, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what's going on.
On the run, it's going on.
"It's not a rareness that Schlepper, for example, requires sexual action for a bottle of water," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks that it will end as soon as they arrive in Germany, crazy, tells Bahr.
Here alone women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and abused in the worst cases.
This leads to traumas of approximately 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily."
Many women are so accustomed that they don't say anything.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big."
Since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, says Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question whether they know about a project similar to that in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no.
For example, there is no such thing in government accommodations in the Upper Hall and Upper Franken.
Even in Schwaben, refugee women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press speaker.
In Upper Bavaria, under and middle French, there are floors or homes in some community accommodations for single women and their children only.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."
"If privacy fails or men and women are brought together, violence against women can occur - on an ongoing basis."
The study states that the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women.
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen at the other place that there is on the house in Munich.
"Since we have spoken around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistent doctors strike: demands for new labour campaigns
Substitutes of the assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new labour campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on the whole Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted on the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "permanently quiet" to problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request official re-negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a ongoing programme of escalating work campaigns that begins in early September.
The disputes led to that assistant doctors strived six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings that were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract was and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would necessarily be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Externalists"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterplayer in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handle, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed slim and he was scarcely warm, even for his reluctant circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have been as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me rather to indicate the opposite.
But a lasting cooling from Putin showed that the Head of State of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at that time was annoyed.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding of confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, complete attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to bear the blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trafficking in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently contested this.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to make a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office in a failed state strike last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, travellers and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm on the Mediterranean.
This week, public television forecasts cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti made it as follows: "Tourists over there, tomatoes over here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West, since it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power to be a weak response.
In addition, the ongoing glance on the pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is urged to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian Head of State certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected government bodies after the attempted coup.
For Moscow, this is certainly a natural thing, which itself has a deep fear of changing regimes.
The summit in this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once told me, "the Alliance of Externalists": two countries that are disregarded and poorly treated from the West and now join themselves.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even stripped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is intended to be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the Bank's Executive Board.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has been distant when it had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand stripes "RBS" have been used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange quotation will change to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more importance - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we do not pursue global but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the vigilance of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into the brands bank, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief Executive Officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori scores his 3,000th win at Predilection at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am easy and very modest.
Dettori takes on the joy when he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4.493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligence that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 prizes if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already rided almost 30 years of winners in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond it he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the trailer of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-free.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glor rich Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defie his twofolds and return to his best form.
And he's not yet at the end for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his 50th year of age.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a Kremlin opinion, it is stated that Putin had "ordered the resignation of Ivanov from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's alternate since 2012, was appointed his successor.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he completed his degree at the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website (in Russian), he was later head of protocol and staff of government staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State in terms of bills and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino to be his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step has made Moscow mysteries.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest acquaintances of Vladimir Putins and works as he works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on their own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is there the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russia's environmental policy at once - was subject to great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kreml website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you to trust this very complicated post for four years at the beginning of 2012.
As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his alternate.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he most familiar with.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's Constitution.
But this post was taken over by another nearby allies of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month in the Los Angeles series set.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his termination.
At the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details about how the character Gibsons from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are reported to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who played previously in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love criminal minds and have put my whole heartblood in the last 12 years," said Gibson in a release published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th season is scheduled to take place on 28 September.
Mysteries about fish landing in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were spiced out by a spring fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone might throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "cover bubbles", which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economics Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Altogether almost 79% of the entire bridge deck are in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high- and low-speed construction.
After the installation of the last road deck and its connection to the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or countryside.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Hekel, as the tolerances that the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Luck to be alive"
Three men have "Luck to be alive" after being thrown before Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on from their own power.
"We saw the boat turn around in its vicinity and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have woken the boat out of their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a boje without a rescue vest.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water have been undamned and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, the boat was dissolved from the person who controlled the boat.
Somebody watched over these men today.
Seriously injured - man hangs on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely hurt.
As the police told us yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When this one came into the apartment, he stepped on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and body.
The police could arrest the offender.
During the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
He then alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street, they met the man's ex-living companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors should be taken into account much more in the future.
How can you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes to the next meeting of the Council a "concept of living".
But the dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas in the future will have to designate 20 per cent of all apartments as social housing."
However, the cheap apartments can also arise in stock.
However, the big dispute in the city hall is, as Bratmann says, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but as much as possible 20 per cent of housing as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left wants harder requirements for investors.
Nevertheless, Bratmann says that the situation in the housing market is getting worse.
If the approach is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff are needed.
It's unclear if we're going to get the professionals.
But the programme is not yet complete: for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
But how do we equal the loss of some 1,300 other cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm, now outgoing bonds should be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing homes back to the price commitment.
This is possible in the West City.
One blow would solve the problem.
For in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price commitment for cheap apartments.
Only: that's what the owners, the housing companies don't want.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City is dramatically increased again, you are distant from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of socially weak people in just a few parts of the city should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must go to the boat."
Although it has focused on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, that there is still no compromise.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that deserves
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children are not going out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure with staring at screens has been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then to video games, and lastly to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in the outside are not mutually excluded.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later then created a cartoon series, play cards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, they can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person delays every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" were hit by deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Body activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships in hunting.
As always, there are moorish game destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What are you doing?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as this game does.
The new one will lose its attraction and the use will be delayed with time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people in hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Easily on the beam.
Respiratory on the floor.
On the whole line brilliant.
And finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American tournament climbed to a multi-war title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her total result of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turn on the swivel bar during the women's single championship tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-fight title and the fifth overall, while strengthening her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who had brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport over the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best tournamentr I've ever seen."
She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of overdimensional expectations.
Do not return with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after they have won gold and silver in the single championship of women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a call sign at the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long way to the top, that is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - are matched with Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, where Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a multi-competition competition, a win series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two spins, the picture deceived.
Swivel beams and ground towers - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lured.
She picked up again with 15.433 on the swivel bar - and put one on the floor with a 15.933.
Raisman embraced her gentlely when they expected her end - a pure formality - and tears flowed on balls glossy red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground exercise she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
With regard to Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who have been killed in one of the most fatal attacks for a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in an entrance, said the authorities.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm, while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police informed that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard police spokesman said that the shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven persons were killed in nine attacks, mainly in Spanish residential areas within four months, and two others were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard to the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died still on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parking car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder, and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and his mother, of course.
But like the fewest of his companions, Edmund has microzephalia, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't.
I can't do this.
I didn't get in on that.
What isn't at all right -- of course, they've come in there," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund might never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
"My first answer to this was 'I didn't know that people still do,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with a walk help.
Edmund could neither sit nor scratch until his third year of life, and he could still not speak.
But he's making progress slowly.
It can run with support and cycling.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund has invented for "Please sing something for me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has invented some characters alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetics like Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as masons or cicavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the cica virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an unconscious future.
I constantly asked what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the cica virus.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rainfall, flooding causes rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. It is expected that more rainfall will occur throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to help the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that the demands for flood vehicles, boats and sand bags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sand bags.
A flood warning system is used over wide parts in south Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still picked up people from the flood in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, increased strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my size.
His wife said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the handicaps and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they had been accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "swiftly spread" as there were still severe rainfall and that the authorities hesitated to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported rain from midnight to Friday tomorrow from 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said that the rainfall had caused the soil to be very full since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa announced 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both now flooded.
The governor of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were rinsed from the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants to take with them, who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but not yet on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shooting injuries, including in the lung, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was aware when transported to the hospital.
"He has been through a lot, his small body had been holed by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgery.
The family of the boy told the broadcaster that he was expected to heal again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are, according to CBS Philadelphia, in stable condition.
The boy was found shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the broadcaster.
The other two victims weren't in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the wounded men of the offenders could be among them.
Researchers told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Pattern shells for storm guns traced to various storm guns left the crime scene.
It seems that this has clearly been a lasting fight.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were hulls.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters involved very actively," police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the police in Philadelphia.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-batter on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the Women's Olympic team in the tournament for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspiring many young girls from other skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and Spanish female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, number one among the female tournaments was an Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but mastery gymastics.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how tournament classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team. Moreover, this is last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality looks like tournaments are a expensive sport and turners are primarily in private tournament clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, decoration, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their turners and families). The list can be continued at any time.
The majority of these tournament clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the tournaments receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to provide a more performable and accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my 20-year tournament.
During my events, we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the tournament, and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the Holing of Olympic Team Gold and thank her so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to impose the contract and said that the NHS was in a "no-one country" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at inhospital hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, announced last night in a communication: "Assistent doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will raise the current staff crisis and refuse to treat all doctors fairly."
For only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through discussions were encountered by the government on reluctance to participate and sometimes on drowning silence.
This happened from a promise Jeremy Hunt had only made last month about that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the pressure and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and doctors were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
The Ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors to be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Staff, asked the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Working campaigns do not reach any of the few but already overloaded teams and service providers, and only prepare patients, nurses and their families for concern, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and have responded positively to the concerns of the Ministry of Health and other ministries regarding custody and Whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, training flexibility, additional training for those returning from work out, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - would be a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of cardiac infarction patients will benefit from one £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended that this be administered more people for a longer period.
The anticoagulant medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and one quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiac infarction and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing material in the artery walls that form coatings.
When the cloth breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot is dissolved, it can flow through the blood flow and stop the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The NICE draft manual, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a double daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a re-infarction may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attack and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend any treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness causes election fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the Office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political Correctness has led to the knowledge that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is ignored as a devastating government report today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacked the police, election observers and council halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "oversensitivities regarding ethics and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up block bands outside the electoral chambers to protect intimidated voters.
He recommended that voters should carry a ID to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, an elector must only mention his name and address.
The report proposes to put non-removable ink on the finger of a person when they give their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only used to prevent election fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election tribunal decided that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be revoked after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community"in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamic accusations.
Rahman is supposed to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he was alarming about the fraudulent lettering - with the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the conduct of certificates to prove identity.
His report states: "As proof was justified that pressure was exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" oversensitivities regarding ethics and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition of political activists working on mail selection documents to stop "chosens".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires more stringent registration checks to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.
Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person once she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
conduct systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are elected.
A three-year limitation on requests for automatic mailing.
Prohibition that political activists process complete letters and envelopes of letters.
The police are empowered to set up lockouts for election stations.
An amendment of the law that facilitates the prosecution of intimidation in accordance with the 1983 People Act (Representation of the People Act 1983).
Prohibition of photography in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensification of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters will go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls across the Metropolitan Police and finds it "awesome" that after the Tower Hamlet case there was no criminal prosecution.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate for corrupt and illegal practices due to a litany," he said.
He was guilty for a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "release checks" of the electoral registration departments of the council halls.
Sir Eric said, "The Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's Radler Doubles and other famous doubles of Olympia Sports in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiad in Rio this week came across the French cycling athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be an impressive double gangster of the Duke of Cambridge.
But this summer, the 24-year-old Olympion is far from the only athlete who fights for gold, who has his own famous doubler - at least not if you can give faith to the social media.
In honour of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that are currently flirting on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood famousities.
The hunter and the wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in the arch shooting Brady Ellison, left, is compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's double gangman on the cyclist track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be a twin.
Brady Ellison, a team member of the U.S. arc shooting team, has caused a storm on Twitter after showing pictures that look awkwardly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer brought the madness into the social media and admitted that he had heard since his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think that's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more on this year: the striking similarity between the British Witspringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian turner Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to pass as a double gangster for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gang higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception Actor
Another continuous comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-brown skin and blonde hair as the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by Fans to be a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user said her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an unbelievably similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winner in the turn Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologize for his statement that Chinese swimmer "as a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-style swimspoke afflicted audiences of the CBC life transfer of the Olmypian games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "how Mief went" and during the race like "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimspot.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the CBS's commentator team to give more color, was heard, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost its connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swims the second stage of the swimming stage 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap to China.
Watchers across Canada reacted quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "as a pig died"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimspot for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost its connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not stand back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC program, apologised live for MacDonald's commentary and said: "We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen wording, we are sorry that it happened."
CBC at the end apologised more than 90 times to the people who answered the comments via Twitter
Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologised quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we apologised quickly to our viewers for the show and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in the mission and tried to justify his comment by stating that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimspot in the CBC Olympia show," he said.
"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark is upset about a woman who trys shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she mustered the way she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelves.
She continued to stumble and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, in which the woman tried the underpants before she put them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she came back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sale area, she took a pair of pants from the edition, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried on them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheating like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took out the underpants that she apparently didn't like, because she put them back in the shelves."
She repeated the same with three other pants before finally decided that she didn't like anything, turned on and went out again.
"She didn't seem to bother that she watched someone - or think about the person who might possibly buy the underpants she had tried it."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that had another person and weren't washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I found out, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had her on and out again and that they were not washed."
A speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, August 9th."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbery at a close distance.
Whether you're approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how you turn the gun for your robber.
If you are approached from the back, then you should turn around as the first one so you can see your attacker and "go out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the lace and rotate, while the attacker crawls together for pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they target the weapon on him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the weapon and rotate it so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and point the weapon to him.
Sounds hard?
Look at the video to see exactly what Mizrachi does.
But remember, it's safest for a robbery to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveller Ian Wright shakes his tongue for a travel guide in the dirtyest places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system to a serious test - by rejecting some of the dirtyest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and traveller, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, washed his trains on a Euro-shine, a landing at Piccadilly Circus, a wash button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking out each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he will enter.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to the light of the day.
The idea of leaking off the dishwashing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely disgusting, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen dishwasher.
During his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal agents as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left what he disbelieved, more than a bad aftersmake in the mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public landings at train stations to waste buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film he told: "Already as a child, I was relatively worried about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water."
In the film, he definitely met his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample removal showed a lumimeter number of over 4,000 units.
Compared to this, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak off after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in various places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "This comes close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I won't enjoy anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Internal Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company defers Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended with saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I had told him to leak, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that were easier to make Ian enjoy them and others with which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've recorded some of these dirty flavors."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of all milk acid bacteria surveyed, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 per cent stated that at least occasionally they use products containing the accompanying milk acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delocation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clashing holes, wooden beads were cut up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smuggled to the walls.
The family was resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered not such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and her reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball fighters, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in some rooms of the house, which may be cut off.
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden rods were ripped up
Neighbors said they saw her fight on the street and had to be called regularly to the police.
Cornwall Housing devoted her and her partner violently from the property this week, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to retire voluntarily.
Delogation was rejoiced by relief neighbors who said their life was made to hell.
One said, "They didn't shake around anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have refused to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overwhelmed side of the community house waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant refused to take any responsibility for their behaviour and for their family, since delogacy is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, since the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community have done, who have bravely joined us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear waste mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police conducted a razzia in the house and found more than 70g of cannabis as well as scales, parapherniles and cash of £1.700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had confessed guilty of the possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say she will delogate tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police said that delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the rules of the house.
"This is about those who think they can behave without self-accusations, as well as those who have been damaged by such behaviour," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep flying military jet over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force placed an incredible crash flight
Air Force indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when scared tourists started to panic after a deep flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic videos showed how the military aircraft flew almost in tangible proximity to the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro, north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the nozzles, without first seeing what came on them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
Today, the Portuguese Air Force announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast, flying so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that the jet flew something deeper than usual due to the poor visual conditions of the surrounding area, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at all.
Land burns have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his vision.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concern for Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans arrive in the duel around the Spanish supercup out against FC Seville, the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double-winner must abandon Neymar with the lower Cup finalist and the ruling European League championship, among others, who fights the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
In the training, the German suffered a band dust in his knee, which clarified the first question at Barca, at least in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years with the status number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the League, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish Master has doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated by 0:4 in a Liverpool test game on Saturday.
Also at 3:2 in the Probegalopp gegen Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
Seville, in turn, has the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European supercup against Real Madrid and strives to the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with eleven successes of the record winners in this competition.
Ma Long in a own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old defeated his landman and "Title Defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4) in a unilateral final in Rio de Janeiro.
The world ranking first took the Golden Grand Slam with successes at World Cup, World Tour Final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title between themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia trick was the former SVS-NÖ legendary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Mom and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had withdrawn to the tribe and left their guards alone in a fair competition.
"The matches so far I've played for my country."
"In the final I'm playing for myself," Zhang had foldedly said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners were posing with the China Führer.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Mom had really to fight with her 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Afterwards he determined the pace at the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points in total.
Because of Ma's superiority, the expected sparkling match did not develop.
However, enough breathing ball change was seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
In his quarter final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusian had been wounded with ribs and had subsequently been in medical treatment and had to be "literally" satisfied with bleach.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia fourth in similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits ′′ huge problems′′ in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concern to lose their majority even in traditional Conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican Highburg Utah.
A rare moment when the typically clear and self-safe multimillionaire expressed concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race in the own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Be guilty of false reports about his candidateship, he resumed his well-known media cheeks.
Republican highburgs wackle
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not at the distance usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered vulnerable.
In an interview by the CNBC broadcaster, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's progress again: "Genauso, as I have done so far".
And moved behind: This will either be successful, or I will take a very beautiful, long holiday.
He does nothing but "to tell the truth."
If it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, be fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party would have threatened to remove funds to support his election campaign if he could not present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress would be more likely to be attacked.
Olympia: Threeth Fraud in Doping Test
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes are threatened by the second doping deal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee informed the Commission to establish a disciplinary commission immediately to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and coach, John Anzrah, had carried out an urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to pursue its own investigations, an IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent IOC measures, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation", it was stated in an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, issued the test and signed," explained Kenia's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, which was on the list for the training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing's fourth World Cup.
Four days earlier, Kenyan Leichtathletik-Delegation Manager Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes of future doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after many doping crimes for a long time.
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out in advance that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create a anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.
As a result, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fight is in accordance with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of TV reports from the ARD have repeatedly claimed that Kenya's doping funds are easily accessible and that there is a considerable mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed them in Russian light sports.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been extensively and systematically immersed.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of loves, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musician conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classics and met with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that Bernstein's music is really in our blood!
In this scene Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because she is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"It resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's an incredibly generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Guiding is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, that is at all very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have refugees, then the Puertoricans went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
According to reports, Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's balloon in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she was planning to leave the warbed country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good in it is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - to prevent people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his appointment by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker of Reid later said that he hadn't yet talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the highest judge for the U.S. Appeal Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were Lacaies and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Treats wants naked calendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 in the 1970s.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine differs from old school playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar also does.
"We have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally on open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality expects mass escape
"Who doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, the president of the Golden-nahe Foundation Dialogue and World.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "some hundred thousand", believes the chairman of the association Ali Topra.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass escape to Germany because of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hard action after the coups.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," said the Federation president Ali Topraking the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already spent months over Kurdish highlands with criminal actions, 500 000 Kurds were on the run in Turkey.
After the ruined pussy, even more secular and opposing ethnic Turks would come.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes refugee himself produces refugees in its own country," said Topra.
The Head of Association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
Thus Erdogan wanted to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or expelled over the past hundred years," said Topra, who is also a CDU member.
The Head of Association called for the federal government to "position as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
There is also a "hexen hunt" against Erdogan critics in Germany.
I don't feel safe for the first time in Germany in the last few months.
The German branch of the Golden Movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionals.
The brand marking as a golden follower destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Who doesn't adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Sakulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Golden- close Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world".
As reported in the newspaper, calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Turks already put the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
On the 30th of June, these were 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-authorized persons (39,625).
This survey does not contain those who have escaped from war, poverty or unperspectiveness.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively politically, i.e. by the state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the country-day election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because more stupid than ever, summer holidays, heat and country election campaign - that bites.
The locals to be convinced by the voters are on vacation.
Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they cannot choose the country day.
There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up airballoons, distribute flyers, and at the end count votes, are only hard to drive up.
Until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass election campaigns shortly to the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strongly Neuling cuts off AfD and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Selling, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, has been making a almost unprecedented election campaign, you can see from his major posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary red-carious predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, the soul ring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel blames the inheritance of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, your "we're doing this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are campaigning at the wrong time in the right place.
She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to major explorations; Merkel's Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is also no harm to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely refrains from the usual election campaigns in market places and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that it has shed the ground in the country, that it has to strive very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You go like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the country.
However, the council of CDU voter Kokert to his fellow rivals is also self-evident: "You must go where it hurts, that is, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Selling has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats last left CDU partners with 22 percent (25) and only just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, the small party with 7% in the surveys, are expected to make the jump into the country day.
They make the holiday not a modern virtue and move their election campaign largely into the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it is called Claudia Müller, President of the State.
Otherwise, green voters travel to search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curving with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still loves it.
Your impression: "Walking holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."
B27 Sanification: Restaurants suffer from blocking
At the speed with which the B 27 is remedied, there is nothing to be softened.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 8 p.m., there are praises on all sides.
"They've made everything pretty tactful," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tank station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site was scheduled to be moved south to mid-term, until the end of October.
It is also commended to meet those responsible for the construction, for example when it comes to the installation of access points.
Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored, the traffic situation within the site has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides from ofterdingen.
The escape traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were partly significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of Office responsible for the transport technical management of the rehabilitation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weihraan had to fight with more traffic noise because many of them were looking for trails and more familiar with their Navi than the signs.
Which led to some trucks being refreshed in residential areas.
Since the speed limitations were also not complied with, the municipality strongly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable overruns," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There's already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was traveling with 77 hour-kilometres in the speed 30 zone.
But since the construction site has moved, it has become calmer.
For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.
But that the B 27 sanation has led to sales break-ins in them, lets everyone who is asked to see through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end-customer", i.e. produces for other companies, has little effect on it.
Also at the Maier car house Thomas Sulz speaks of a "slight decline" but also admits that, of course, "the running experience is lacking".
The locals are most bagged along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard.
Customers from Heching, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The sales losses are "over 50 percent".
The road renovation has thrown its operation "within two years".
He had to fire half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt answered a question by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, pointing out that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it should also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows from other districts where something more generous was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family company has been based here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other common guests are less often looking past because of complex traffic.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his family clientele returns after the end of the renovation work.
Despite crises with BSE and bird influenza, Göhner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his clientele to be the largest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
On behalf of the fight against terrorism, laws are continually enforced.
After the recent attacks, Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what has a guilt status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically acceptable to the coalition partner", says the Federal Minister in presenting his new security package.
You don't overcharge anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also take part in this.
However, as Minister of the Interior, he was based on results and on a "reachable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière took a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are now more extensive.
Some things are already known, proclaimed, said: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière starts a second start for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and cut off the German passport by jihadists with double citizenship.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
However, he considers that this is reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance for the coalition partner at all.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportation and more opportunities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security audit.
In the case of debts to rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their documents to hide their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them also work unexhausted and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, in the inequality of patient - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to distinguish between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply busy could not be ruled out in the election periods.
Internal security has been enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
In recent days, there has been a great deal between the two parties.
First of all, a fierce dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security-political idea collection of some Union internal ministers, in which the heads of staff also demand a Burka ban and a withdrawal from double citizenship.
De Maizière is also working here for reconciliational sounds.
He doesn't think anything about a departure from a double pass.
We have satisfied the debate in Germany.
Reopening them would be inappropriate.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutionally firm at all corners and whether it is actually "mutable" for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
But also the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals careful willingness to talk and says, "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still coming through glimpsefully.
Despite Diesel scandals, the number of deliveries is increasing worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
In the callback, there are spines around a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the second half of the year when deliveries are more behavioural.
Although Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to present a plus in the past year despite the diesel business thanks to its many brands and some well-functioning markets.
In July, however, the VW core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company listed in Dax reported.
Worldwide, VW sold with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles in July than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, sales were 14 per cent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, deliveries were almost sixth off.
Trademark Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a "changed economic environment" in terms of purchasing.
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempt to strike in Turkey, the British vote on withdrawal from the EU has also been burdened," explained a speaker.
In the United States, where the exhaust gas store escalated first, there is also a minus to be.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony continues to come glimpsely through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a minus deliveries from 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles are available.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to present a sales plus from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, with 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated a software exhaust tests.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for re-equipment into workshops.
In the course of the renovation, VW confirmed that the renovation of cars had no negative effects.
There is no deterioration of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the vehicle re-equipment.
The car manufacturer has issued a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after the renovation, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called in business circles on Friday.
Reason are legal fragments.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for umarmed diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations of these are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after re-engineering are not deteriorated and that all vehicle approval-relevant values are unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come into a workshop with a motor damage for half a year after the renovation - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal to cause uncertainty regarding possible guarantees, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require rich savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "There are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Daily Money Accounts."
The Bundesverband of Deutsche Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savings would not have to "be afraid to pay for their savings-gross penal interest".
If banks store money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee is charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards to private and corporate customers for deposits of over EUR 100,000 on Giro or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
For some time, he has kept 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he cannot use.
"They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend 4000 euros for every million."
It will now continue to pay the costs according to the polluter-payer principle.
To just leave the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I can't even be the fifth!", said the Board.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bayern Cooperative Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs for all banks".
It is not possible to carry them alone on a permanent basis in an economically viable basis.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With fine interest for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its 2014 Skatbank-Filiale.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay large amounts of deposits, and competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong."
A banker said that at Lake Tegern there is "a client that is a little more equipped with assets".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it carries free money.
The Cooperative Bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The cooperative association Bayern "is currently not known for any other banks that calculate a cost allowance for deposits of private customers," said Sprecher Ernst.
The President of the Federal Federation of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go down negatively to the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is hard, and it threatens the removal of investors to the competition.
The customers in Germany will not be able to fall in the width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys sound plates?
Lonely men of middle age love plates.
Before you go to the comment part, to leave him under the pseudonym NotAllSingleMenMedlerenAlters with severe insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of sound plates is not due to a boom in millennials that wish to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56 % vs. 53 %) and enjoy spending time alone (69 % vs. 66 %).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wildening before I stay standing, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were established - there are still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men of middle age) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight men of middle age, one woman, probably around 20), is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snap shot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and plundered.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have to see themselves buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I conducted, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the boom to the followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record shops offer a calming community of equal minds.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record shells, objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling an empty or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is with me as a collector and I think it is with many people.
It is a simple way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers," a staff member flies out of a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noticed a "trophea aspect" of the revival.
"Somebody just came in here recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it in the board," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-intensive, less music-intensive.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a bumpy audience when I go in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists making photos, teaboys and women of middle age.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental jazz droned from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but nasty mental traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
She's making a window-distance rather than a big shop.
It doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives off with a loved soaper.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I show the appearance of toasting the jeans hot pants, I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouping themselves for a moment to Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just purely decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plating art".
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Although my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, they ignore, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who live in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with the buzzing by plate shops on Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while avoiding the staring look of a terrible 30-year-old false moderator who asks about the shoulders of no men of middle age.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientificly, the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigated the shark, says that the record was with a woman who is supposed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects the offer about breaking up shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to depart from dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to break down 72 temporary shops where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdryer services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be cut down because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also argued that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people conducting the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais Prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than feeding people "in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downhill trip was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run for use and offers 200 meals per day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that closing would be "for these children a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old."
On Friday, the two help organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrants estimated that the number of jungle residents had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic season, the Radprof Tony Martin does not want to be underwhelmed.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place at the sugar hat.
"It's really hard for me to comment on yesterday's timeframe," Martin said.
He had to analyse in peace the reasons for the debacle.
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the time-drive World Cup in Katar in October.
"I'll look at everything we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion who had lost on Wednesday at the 54,5 km more than three minutes at the Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis professional victory missed semifinals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the Rio Quarter Final: The world rankings 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Victory, which was plagued by back problems, was only able to carry out its impact once and acted powerlessly compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance to jump into the final round.
The Australian Open Winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional Tommy Haas had obtained a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter final of summer games had been the last in 1992.
Never stood a German duo in a single Olympic half-final.
Group increases on start-up for live video game transfers
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not report on Thursday.
Beam started his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide equipment.
The game giant Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already waking up.
The staff of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle to date in the U.S. state of Washington, move to Microsoft headquarters in California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi told.
For the customers, no change should be made by the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The live streaming market of video gambling activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.

Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser has to set itself to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested, which are designed to transfer speed sensors particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accidents where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or to renovate bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limitation with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: His battery holds five days in continuous measurement, the case data is encrypted via a modem.
The laser measurement technique also allows all vehicles to be captured simultaneously through several tracks.
Variable speed limitations as well as transit bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-risk condition, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer clutch.
In order not to simply steal it, it is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and also shot-proof outside case.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal countries and has now been used.
Foreign authorities also flashed with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold gets
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom at the 7th Rugby came to a sudden stop at the final barrier in the form of Fiji when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side stepping, backing, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - the fourth of the UK on that day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best shape in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that tomorrow at least a British will have a gold medal around his neck: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind itself.
Eight years ago, they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one.
This snake will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and made the GBs attacks strike out of fun.
It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in driving buses. World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau pulled over in the corner.
With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
An enthusiastic tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua led a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-appearing and there was still more than a minute of play ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou jumped through further weak tackling of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning about it.
It's like that.
GB made fundamental changes to the mid-term and closed the Fiji gap... for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time, until Josua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game passed for a long time in favour of the South Sea islanders whose fans sang, swinged flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-tip with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pipe sounded, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked devastatingly beaten into the lawn.
Earlier the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinal with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a narrow semifinal match from the race - UK's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the coach to win the rowing
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first race to the last, 220 hard Hieves entering history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two who were sitting on the rowing, there were three voices on the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all present when they raced to the second Olympia Gold in the second in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who set such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39th unforeseeable effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in the rowing, there is a batalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the trainer who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bubble cancer that is operating and they did that.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a bit changing the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start being treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediateness of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning with talking a little more than usual, trying to handle his own fears.
Stanning, who was head of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's going a massive thank you. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not stand.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to lock up, Stanning and Glover had too much reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not about to do something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic winner.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
Exemplary for 31 years of clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Use Association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be "exemplary in Bavaria".
A small French drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
That was what it was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution from the Bavarian radio.
Shortly later, the Water Forum of the Government of Sub-Franken appreciated the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group applied "Bayernwide as an exemplary".
All of this, Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the purpose association, stands behind, 28 years as Managing Director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein Group’s drinking water association, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and ponds with approximately 5,500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was recruited as a waterkeeper in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the purpose association in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very varied and ranged from water management and maintenance, office and organisational activities, budget setting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, she called the launch and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the field of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There was no stop and innovations were repeatedly taken because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he lived the water-purpose association as if it was his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of the Veitenstein Group's success for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Sub-Franken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterkeeper, and he was a faithful guy.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he referred to the construction of the well and the restructurement of the purpose association.
But the biggest challenge and most difficult use was the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here, minus 17 degrees will have to work all night so that the localities could be supplied with water.
Also the supply of Neubrunn could only have been maintained once because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with tubes.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, the successor of Rupert Göller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko openly embraces the autism of her son Tiago and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease had been recognized with her son, she believed that she had to die.
But the now eight-year-old Tiago had made good progress and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: When I ask him something that is two years behind when I sang to the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to Bassbariton Erwin scrap.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bargteheide - Man shoots on lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner in a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) at 10:45 a.m. on Friday, and hurt her deadly.
"The man even called and told us that he shot his lifemate," said a police officer.
The offender is on the run, and the offender is publicly sent after him.
In the meantime, Sven S. could be on his way by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown burned and has a smoothness.
In the meantime, the police have published a picture of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a smoothness.
The man should not be directly addressed.
He could still carry the gun with himself, according to the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a relationship state.
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck did not want to provide any information about the tathering process or the relationship between perpetrators and victims, but confirmed that a man had been killed.
"It's a killing offence."
"We don't say more at the moment," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operation command (SEK) was at the crime scene.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.
Financial burdens that threaten the industry from eco-power promotion are from the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy for the stock plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry remains, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West German General Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really glad that we've finally achieved this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to use gases from the high furnace for the production of electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said to the WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the European Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants will a 20% EEG fee be applied.
But they are not raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
This broadly defines the status quo of the previous scheme.
Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"With regard to our campaign 'Stahl is the future', this is a first step."
"More people have to follow."
"In addition to the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment objectives must be balanced," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen when the world's largest producer country in China, given the weakening domestic demand, threw massive steel to the world market.
European producers claim price dumping from Chinese steel groups.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed slightly.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imports of steel have shown effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has cleared up.
It is unclear how sustainable the recovery of prices is.
The German industry prince Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have stagnated more.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as reported by the Steel Economic Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined in the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been 2% below the previous year.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does seniors good
The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the choir, in the teaching office she performed the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an older choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test she feels balanced, happy and overall more alive, she says.
At the same time, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because singing is just from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with equal minds, describes hackers.
Through regular interaction, seniors can connect and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are dissolved at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To meet and organize themselves, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be in a positive sense, says hacker.
Because older people are training deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the puste so quickly in everyday life.
Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singings often have a very special effect on older people," says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of senior organisations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song texts and especially melodies, people who suffer from the disease themselves find themselves behind long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, Lenz explains.
At the same time focusing on your own voice and a specified rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through singing in the choir, says hacker.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time for something, I am getting better and awaken beyond myself - strengthens this experience.
Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks that he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes around?
Looking for the appropriate offer seniors have different options, says hackers.
If someone from the familiar circle sings in an senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior chores can also be found via the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help in the Internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises hacker.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats to the screams of young animals
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babys on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen also did not leave the males cold - but they were always the same as the females.
Female cats can recognize the rate of excitement of cat babys at the miauen of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of cats, which are in great need, as scientists have found out from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH).
Kater also responds to the calls of cats - but always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between the miauen of less and severely excited young animals for the males are either not perceptible or not relevant," said Biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and height of the cat scream differed with the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the animal farming of MHH.
First of all, they were played by young people who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mothers and sisters.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited cats, which were further raised.
In spite of the small sample, researchers consider their results to be meaningful.
"All women, even those who did not have their own young children, responded differently to the scream," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when that call played the more excited cats.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, said the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sukür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sukür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game will be held again in Turkey.
Before the duel of the Erzrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the exception was imposed after the attempt to crash in July, the government cost not to impair the everyday life of normal citizens.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Golden, which is made responsible for the attempt to strike.
There is also no stop to football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sukür, the Attorney issued an arrest warrant.
So it is accused of being a member of a terrorist group that is now living in America.
Sükür should be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the exceptional condition initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, it actually has no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The night's "democracy growth" in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan terminated on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Worker Club are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
However, in view of the dramatic experience of history, the major of the Turks is the strict rejection of military rods.
Even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With Pocal Winner "Gala" it will come back particularly to Lukas Podolski.
During the last season, the Cologneer demonstrated his sporting value: With 17 gates and nine models in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season as topcorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce he scored the 1:0 winner.
The newspaper "Fanatik" rejoiced him: "He was the best in the square."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record master found a reconciling finish.
After the round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it only reached rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal matches as Süper-Lig-Torsky King.
This is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In this connection, the Gomez, which was under contract with the AC Florence and was only loaned to Besiktas, had announced after the attempt to strike, not to return after his EM leave because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Manager Fikret Orman.
However, the storm would have to be willing to abandon about one third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite doping: these athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transgressed athletic singers can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The topic of doping continues to determine the titles of the Olympics in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained of her right of departure shortly before the games after a doping block, was graciously spoiled and excavated at her start (100 meters of chest).
She was proud of the hall and had been provoked with her appearance.
When she found that she would not pick up gold, the audience broke out in a jubilee tower.
However, there are many other athletes who, despite the doping past, start at the Rio Olympics.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light sports.
He was already blocked twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his banner, the 2004 Olympic winner and the former world champion are even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-fold world champion had to hold a six-month lock in 2010, after she had been shown to take the painful oxycodone.
She had severe tooth pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic winner was tested positively on the banned stimulant methylhexanamin from 2013 and the 2013 champion of Europe from 2010 to 2016.
Perkovic contested the scientific intake and was blocked for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
Lashawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and 21 months blocked.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, cherished Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerworp, Belarus): Almost hardly one athlete was later acquainted with so many medals.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old was also forced to give out Olympia silver in 2004 for steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He received the 2008 Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games, which was also known as the Bronze Medal, on the basis of a judgment of the CAS International Sport Court.
At 80.04 m it is ranked two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Goen, China): The World Order and Gold Favorite was tested positively only in May, but still can start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the use of a banned food supplement, the blockade of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mild and already expired on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.
She planned her home trip for early September.
The fact that the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, says Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, was first exploded in a quarter on Thursday night.
According to police, a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday early, two explosions again went up, and according to the authorities another person was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
During the explosion near the Patong beach popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police information.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed a city employee.
According to the authorities, the explosion set had gone into the air in a flower beet in front of the coast police district.
Finally, explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injured persons.
You're starting from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings carry the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethave Friday early before journalists.
"We assume it's a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is about the acts of Muslim rebellions.
The Thai media also wanted to see a pattern of attacks typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the assassinations were not related to the Islamic rebellion movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were put.
Over the past few days, the authorities would have received secret service information on imminent attacks in the southern part of the country, but they would not have been informed about the exact time and locations.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police advised their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they do not usually target tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.
Following the bombing explosions now, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be strictly followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After disputes between security forces and Muslims, it is advisable to avoid unnecessary trips to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This will also give great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The military nudge, which had taken power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, has benefited itself from having brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not been able to control the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hindu scream - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.
The right "identified movement" is in the view of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several state offices, the Constitutional Protectors in the Federation also observed the group.
"We see at the 'Identitary Movement' points of reference for efforts against the free democratic fundamental order," said Constitutional Protector Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "identified movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multicultural waivers", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of own identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identificators".
Maaßen said that his authority was in close consultation with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identified movement' try to pick up their target group where they stand," said the head of the Constitution.
Generally, extremists try to speak them with a youthful language, often with poppy music.
That would be done by Islamists as well as by right-wing extremists.
This is not a betuable advertising for your own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to be emotional to people.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, there had been reports from several federal states about the contacts of the "identifiers" to AfD politicians.
Maassen said he didn't have any knowledge.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain persons who are extremist, changes its target and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the marked increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be right-wing structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that there are other right-wing or micro-groups that plan to attack asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a control of legal terrorism across Germany or across Europe is not recognisable.
The groups previously formed at regional level or in social networks.
Mosses expressed concern about the many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene.
"So, many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists before, who may have been politically indifferent or who have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or left, but who have radicalised themselves by the right-wing extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habe becomes Internethit
Not always the Olympics or World Records determine the titles of the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swims so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut-out was selected.
In the social networks Habte then became the viral Internethit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his advancement with a 48-second residue and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was given a special start right from the international swimming association.
This will be distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habe is ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English boulevard magazine "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him, based on a "Wildstandsbauch".
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, played no role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run gave media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to enter in a run over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Freneticly, Moussambani was fired at that time.
The 22-year-old at that time only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never reached such a distance before the competition.

An open industrial loft in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the Central Library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a store at New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old bargainer had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash.
There were no traces of the perpetrator.
There is also no video monitoring.
Trump doesn't see the threatening election defeat so close
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the U.S. President is not going to happen, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
Then he's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US Presidency elections in November, he wouldn't care: "Finally it will either work, or I have a very, very beautiful, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it is okay, said Trump.
He named the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist militia of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, the last time there was more and more resistance.
Post increases in the trade in electric transporters
An electric supplement vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently great.
The mail also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
Shortly, the group wants to start trading with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from next year on to the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has examined whether it should sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies.
Post Office Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the poster manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term to maintain a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK management expires after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its manager Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations suddenly came - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain, the longer the success he promised it was not.
Turbulences at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the world-wide number Five of the industry is facing a personal start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GFK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already withdrawn from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board already took over the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September.
He is supposed to officially take over the role of a "president" until a successor for Hartmann has been found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Whoever will be the leader of the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investors on Friday it was said that the shareholders had last been disappointed about the continued success of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK tip since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the most recent bad GFK business figures, each shareholder will eventually be disturbed.
"If it were the case with BMW, it would also be the Quandts," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey even in the second quarter of 2016, following backlogs in the previous quarters.
With 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
The profits in the second quarter have predominantly been burdened by the declining value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The EUR 139 million corporate depreciation required in the Consumer Experience business area provided the Group with a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus runs in cramphorns in grave: eight injured
In the event of an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich County).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police informed.
According to the 66-year-old driver of a passenger company from Eisenach, she had to avoid a matching truck that partly drove on the countertrailer.
The bus came right off the street and drove into a grave, as a police speaker Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The firefighter released the inmates.
Six rescue cars and one emergency medical car came to the accident site on Landstraße 2.
The uninfected travellers were brought back to the Pewsum district of Krummhorn by a line bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic metre of waste water shall be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros, for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (to date 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (to date 2.18 euros).
At the site in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again, at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic meter.
Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that these wastewater facilities were covered.
On the basis of the legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.
From 1 October 2016 the citizens, as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschenkalhl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the money bag.
The tariff increases range from 48 to 67 per cent.
As director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the charges for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
The serious increases in charges led Schmidt to the fact that all three sewage plants were relatively small facilities with a very small sewage attack, ranging from 6800 to 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, the sewerage volume in all three plants was slightly declining.
In addition, during the subsequent calculation period, all three plants had suffered significant remedial and repair costs, not least due to their age.
The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkalhl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged for damage in the Azendorf sewage system.
In the Welschenkohl pump plant, the nearly 20 years old transport plants had to be overtaken from ground and Lopp, after nearly 20 years of operation, had to bail out the first cleansing pond, dispose of the cleansing sludge and install an additional ventilation facility to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "The additional maintenance and maintenance costs were included in these extraordinary costs, which should be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in previous calculations in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the small sewage attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance are "complete".
In this connection, Schmidt added, the market community had been spared of large entertainment costs in the wastewater plants over the last 20 years.
In the view of stone houses, the situation for these plants will continue to remain precarious, especially since the area of supply of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Association cannot be extended to these plants because they are deficiencies.
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% by CPI.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed in the following categories of consumer goods compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat criticized "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already limits to absurdity.
You can turn into an ananas, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy lightenstein painting.
The filters are unblooded, property-driven tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past in which they were accused that the app Blackface would promote or white skin as a beauty side.
When some users suggested a filter that gave them slimeys, false teeth and sparkled wangs this week, some critics called a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity.
The news and the enrage were widely disseminated on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to Anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racialism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.
Others decided to reject the Anime Comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of art, whose tweets were widely disseminated about the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulneratable and mildly discomfortable."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-visual, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the devaluating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stolper wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult to keep such things unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In an article for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her work with a hash day: #Delete Snapchat.
"Or she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in her staff, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but, according to a speaker, the company recently hired a staff accountant focusing on underrepresented groups of people and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would let her Snapchat account close and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say it's not okay."
Military leadership fake ISIS Secret Service Information, notes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual conditions on site, a Congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how seniors changed their assessments of American efforts to combat the Islamic State.
Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News services information typically enjoyed by high-level Centcom commanders has regularly shown a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military retreat of Mosul could start already in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Heads of Central Command changed the news service reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were played that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democrat members of the Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced in an opinion the highest-level Democrat in the Committee, a member of the Adam B. Ship Representation House.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of news service reports," damaged morality among analysts and " gave excessively little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of the White House's intervention with the Centcom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon Inspector General, which were received after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. C. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports from the Congress, while the investigations of the Inspector General were still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite different opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reverse effects beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of disputes from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the government of the time under George W. Bush, against the recommendations of many analysts, only a small crew in Iraq, and a little time spent thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, noted that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the raffineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional raffineries would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market.
This knowledge was not published, however, reports the Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by legislative members for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is ahead
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember that she ever did.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in memory.
She knows, however, that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same time in their group with the British women in the first place, who remain unbeatable after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The UK and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two in their group of six teams will be the first and second place each.
The first place will take the strong Dutch women a little longer away from the way that the other group leads.
Whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising spine through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of hockey in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years of age she became a national player in the United States, the most recent in the team's history.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the frame.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English, became coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work in London that we have now.
We've been able to rip the roar completely around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the nearby area.
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lumped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guided tour.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the United States gatekeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the center of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rasing season between competition and pursuits.
It's as if the Olympic fake itself was a burning stave that was drawn from the armbrusher to the swimmer to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting hose in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a woman's swarm with grubes, could have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmer, turner or even softer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic Flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not widely recognized: air gun shooting, arc shooting, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and let it rule for a long time.
But if I modestly should make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw my attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so scarcely perceived over the past 16 years that many of those I had interviewed did not know that it was an Olympia sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete by 2012 who made it up to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medal this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthly enthusiasm.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonful trembling of its never-willing shock - but also the gray of the turn and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Springboard".
Acknowledging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and have to have a series of falling movements (twists, heels and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Two-and-a-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will fight each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medals hoped must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They're not only chasing the target line or the starting wall, but in the television transmission they're also pursuing another horny goal: the world's or the Olympic record.
The targeted striving is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a tears.
But it's also what I feel tired even when I watch these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she blows off, apparently hardless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant removal of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The qualifications and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved through the anxiety and objectification of male athletes - as recently proposed by the male US towers, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community ringing to the air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a US ally
Violence protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia were confronted with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that ten protesters were killed during the collisions with the police during shooting.
Is Ethiopia going to break up?
In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid allier of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was unpleasant.
Witnesses reported police shooting and killing ten unarmed demonstrators.
Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or early of this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is, after Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy grew at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was nothing but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have consistently referred to the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, while dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or drove to the outskirts of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to the rage attack regarding the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time the tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this twisted, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogad, who have been more or less convicted in recent years, could use the turbulences and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of shouting under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in the case of protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered in such a way to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since ages, the Amharas, which come mainly from Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But this is also changing right now.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominated in military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly enthusiastic about detecting early signs of discontent and using Special Representatives to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a revolt was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which according to analysts appear to have been robbed by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, although they were less than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And she adopts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters attacked Tigray's business in Gondar, a city of Amhar, and hatred against the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the USA and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across the neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break down in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin hike."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by stating that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, had not been seriously meant to be the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandly with the American public.
It also brings his convicts, who strive to take him into protection during an eventful phase, into the original position to have to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the statement at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he did not really intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism is down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign for falling survey values to the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already argued Sarkasmus to defend him.
At the end of July he strongly criticized himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said "of course I meant this sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language limits in politics and then to rotate back if needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear" depending on how the reaction happens." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of decreasing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more appreciable tone as his survey values have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading leadership in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is more focused on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal fellows into the uncomfortable situation to have to stand to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts today to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was a almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-bankers, completely wrong and it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Ms. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed the ISIS to spread by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and warned them of driving around on each of his words and being against him.
He praised the "poor, miserable" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the Presidential Office.
Once the price is removed from the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a disgusting café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were banished from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals saddened it as the last loss in a fragility city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB died, the Chelsea Hotel excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, it's also a new invention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are yarns like capers and sucked onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant current to old family customers.
"Many old customers were also banned by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I became aware that it was on coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day, instead of her usual Iced Coffee, she ordered a blended chai tea, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarterly after seven, every day, like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Everything-Bail with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he switches his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't care about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-breasted coffee of the coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice room wants to fill and sell the cold-broasted coffee into bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a steward and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his appearance as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a poor place for refined delicate foods on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purple and a plumpudding as dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" told about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest cooperation, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publisher on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato pear and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered hack bread, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"The rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There were peanuts, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as a dinner.
Coe screamed.
"It must have been laid in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pasta was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungering Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" marks the paths that the country managed not to be the snakeland anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, enthusiastic topic for the Americans," Coe agreed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: secret foods such as breads and cash rolls were used as basic foods, the casserole as "wonderful way to recycle food residues," said Brickman, as cooks could hide unappetitive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried because a rich and nourishing satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, brickman prepared a meal from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at noon," says Coe.
Brickmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since then, householders - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have driven the country's eating habits like that.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to meet the challenge of transforming pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical tastings.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasteful.
While publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he was eating like the millionaire man of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a almost golden dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully out of reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a householder with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortless preparations."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country came back to its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She was really afraid of losing food," Coe said.
Brickman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleaned up at Eisenberg's, they and Coe developed a dessert that they had prepared at home: the flavor endssert, the president Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each dived a little reluctantly a lobster into the tight, brown limbs.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a call three times.
Like a Can-Do-Budgetier, he said to his wife, "Some hacked walnuts would help."
Killed in bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old died even in an attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group who, according to the picture label, saved almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to draw people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video by the civilian protector showing him in 2014 when a baby was rescued from the ruins of a house.
It made the Syrians a bright symbol in the gray of war.
But as a hero, he never saw himself, said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had talked in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters discarded four fibrous bombs over the Alzadia district, one being filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing distress.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebra is almost 400 years old
Rare view.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with more than 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only get young when they are 150 years old.
In an hour, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates set 2.6 km/h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the special journal "Science" at least about a Greenland shark that might be 392 years old.
"Wansinn", Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist for a long time suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, and they live in the eismeer in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
Their tempo of time they were feeding when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
However, these sharks do so: In the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of one robe, and another had swallowed the bone of a young ice bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patroling at the bottom of the eismeer and searching for kadavers that go down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that between 2010 and 2013 fishermen took before Greenland or Spitzbergen as by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the shark using the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks and the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two small sharks had noticeably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons attempts drag larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts in the third-century animal with 220 centimeters of length, so it was expected to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
On the other hand, all major Greenland sharks in their lens core had normal carbon-14-mixes produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females would only be young when they were more than four meters old.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years old, Greenland sharks can be grown for at least one and a half centuries.
This also is likely to be the world order for vertebrates at present.
It is not a coincidence that such methusalems live mainly in icely waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwalk, in which the bacon had a 120-year-old harp peak on the neck, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on sparse flames.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In addition, to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram elephant.
Another advantage: you have less enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as early as possible offspring," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlin.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
At the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on the issues of construction.
With ease, the panel noted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of newly designated residential areas can begin".
After the lands, lands and lands were clarified and applications for measurement were made, the sale of lands in the residential areas of "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Bingerstraße - Extension Section 1) to interested parties was no longer hindered.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau also address young families and adequate seniors.
As it was said, volunteers can immediately report to the town hall, the municipal council is expected to consult on the award of the plots during its September session.
In order to also meet requests for the resettlement of other industrial enterprises associated with the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-sectors, which had only been newly established in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area of undertime larn, the already designated area of business is extended by two plots towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city am Main thus has the best chance in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to attract shifted jobs and companies from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Brexit," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the financial and real estate markets of the IW.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses are allowed to continue operating financial transactions across the EU from London.
To date, they have enough authorisation in the UK for the so-called EU passport.
That's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced shifting jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby association expects 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB) speaks of responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
Although the OECD has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the banknote is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, but as with Dublin, it is poorer in infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy-to-use commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, the rents for top commercial real estate are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of the company consultancy Mercer, the city stands on 7th place, Luxembourg on 19th place, Dublin on 33th place and Paris on 37th place.
Although quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors", the IW concludes.
However, in spite of Brexit's voice, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to the economic researchers.
The forces also speak for this: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector, and in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C Patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimburse the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C dispute with the Pharmaceutical Company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation for the violation of two patents from Merck, which were related to the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, including the Minide and other ethical acts.
On trial on Thursday, U.S. Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to pay the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck tried each other and took possession of the active substance in the medicines of Gilead for laboratory work, which Sofosbuvir was based on.
U.S.-supported troops say that they have rebuilt full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S. supported troops have rebuilt full control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently exploring the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have released over 2,000 civilians held hostages by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the DKS-alliated Manbij Military Council of Reuter.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just doing cleaning work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her fiscal statement for 2015 on Friday, which gave the Presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015 Clinton's USD 1 million was spent for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in speech honors; the former Foreign Minister announced a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster publisher for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, has published his tax statements for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," announced Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast to that, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter about the release of the Democrats' presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks have been completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business practices and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks to publish his tax declaration.
On Thursday she also discussed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements," she said about the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrial Conglomerate has its seat here, called for Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had "fear" for the voters and not for the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clintons tax statement showed that they only earned USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton's dividends and income taxed USD 109.000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people's settlements - they throw condoms on them, filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has, together with the US nature protection, intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their houses and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Elefant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have seen a change in their attitude within these communities, with much more confidence that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell's CEO in a communication.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a flock and blazing into a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "chily cloud" is thrown.
Chile powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body in a condom whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is inflammed, the condom opens up with a crap and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last option is a thruster who shoots a golden rainfire in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer accepts investment projects by business operators with a kuss hand - especially retail in the nuclear city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the City Council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales skios on the Rhine River in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony in the construction.
"We generally welcome new business operators, but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine shore, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director beats Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "Arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unveiled a media alarm after he had told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre-election, since Arab guests had "required" a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eliminated?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure was a "intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it was that there was even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre-election be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas trader called this a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by this event.
That is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
There's no need for explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, in which people called it a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it had given up the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame you," it was said in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel located on the noble Kurfürstendamm is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly sent all the accusations from itself and called the incident an "unfortunate" and "apologized" with Lanzmann, reports The Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel did not appear on the shortlist," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to break the students apart, which led the police to use rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their frustration over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen graffitits spraying on walls against the provisional president Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators in mass went on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from the office by a vote of the Senate on their resignation.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the annual sales between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest of Russian companies in business in the country has increased strongly, the ambassador informed.
Russian companies enter into existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagoryan.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved by delivering machines, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
For this year, Dzhagoryan is based on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative issued around 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes that it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state," he said.
Witnesses searched for: Beverages market in forest brine attacked
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the drink market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a firearm, three dark dressed people who had mutilated their faces demanded the issue of cash from the beverage market employee and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The police don't tell us how much money has been collected.
The perpetrators are supposed to have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, which is relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The offenders must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, after the attack and fled from the scooter park in front of the parking lot with the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (sliding ring).
Anyone who has made observations related to the robbery at the time of the crime (as opposed to 19.45 a.m.) should be alerted to the police.
Nagold: game and fun during summer holidays
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group/social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Federation with their guardians on their summer holidays in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreational home Hardtwäldle, the life-frequent group was enquêted during the first week of school holidays.
Several whole-day trips were on the programme.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoos.
On the other hand, to Mulbronn, where there was a special child guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Keltens.
On the hot days the group at the deep sea in Maulbronn was pleased, which invited to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary, children and caretakers were spoiled with their self-prepared body foods such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte evening".
On the day of the home trip the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned home happyly.
Haigerhole: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministers of the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were handled.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome Wall Tour of all ministers in expected two years, the St. Anna High Minister Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multiday pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the bishop city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage was offered this year, at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercifulness, with the gate of Mercifulness opened for this purpose at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Sacred Rooms went on their way.
The evening before, Pastor Storost sent out the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and granted the pilgrimage.
From Horb the train was driven to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Dear Woman stands and thus the Pilgrimsweg was started by the Münster.
In the morning and evening the individual daily tours were embodied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the road, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made rest to sing a song of their own pilgrim song.
For the nights there were priesthood homes of the local parishes.
At the stage goals Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Days thereafter, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, had to first climb down about 500 metres of height and then climb again.
The earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathtub.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
The minis arrived at Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage of cooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristry and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went by train back to Horb.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when British gold wins for cycling
Last night, the Scottish Callum Skinner ran into the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll that his landlord Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. The young spund made the legend proud when he stormed home to retrieve a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after in March they took only a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotch that has now developed.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher corridor to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked out from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
In the final round we set up an Olympic record and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.
He later withdrawed this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the tribe."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We got away from so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23th (a seemingly holy date for British sports; that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a profit of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That'd be Hoy's.
Kenny next takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the target in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will certainly be focused.
He had struggled with officials yesterday before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie started in World Orders in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a bunch of medals.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas played in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and mobbing charges, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But when you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the melting of Portland as a result of the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of the aluminum melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company informed.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A subsidy fixed for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the melting consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa melting in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, lastly, due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting company with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is assumed that another three owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by a majority of Alcoa and Alumina joint venture, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting company," the company informed.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were so-called "safety transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will end in 2017.
"AgL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on the revenues on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fixed-term markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL informed that it had depreciated the value of the contracts already in its annual closure of $187 million in "expected termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "capacity of Alcoas... to operate the melting process or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting process" does not impair.
The US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of explaining why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Regarding the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes approximately 600 megawatts and tomago electricity annually.
If both plants disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the [power market].
And it would not be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand messenger of Estee Lauder and running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), written reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-affected act almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest made the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a sign-drive rabbit on a broadcaster at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim liked to beat her with regard to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were there in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a size that is more similar to an image band than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages advertising).
The revealing of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been swept through before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Over the last few years, there were clearly more "familys, the models" on the cover than "models, which are the famous" on the cover.
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand messenger Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality Stars or today's young people who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true of Jenner).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a little tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the bullshits of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the message came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But driving around on the mismode seems to go past the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is a super model in the truest sense of the word.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure, she's on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal Law Centres reject 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country's need for assistance are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is focusing on the impact of further reductions in funds on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have any means for unfair deloyation and similar - are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance in their application.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively exploited, are ready for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Centres of Local Law of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Centres of Local Law showed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the revocation of the federal government's decision.
"Queen's municipal legal centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with incomprehensible and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been dismissed unfairly - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
From June 2017 the federal government will cut the funds by 30%, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these shortcuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise the resources for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities and that the government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after employee allegedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inaction after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina was targeting a shooting weapon to an employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state on Wednesday at the District Court of Charlotte.
Bordini stated that for months he had waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "draw a gun, put his right finger on the draw, and rambled the run in Vincent's knikehle," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the complaint.
"Guns don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a revolt when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and weapon friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had cut off his words from the context and that he would not be pushing to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and Philip for body injury and persistent mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was not available for a statement.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
No response was received to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
To date, the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
Berlin/Schwerin: Enquiry before Country Elections: Lost SPD and CDU
During the forthcoming elections in the Bundesländer Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This provided representative surveys by the INSA Institute of Opinion Research for the "Image" magazine (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could dominate almost further, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
However, in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have good chances to continue to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party would therefore only be in front of the CDU, according to the survey, which could be 23 percent again.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
In spite of slight losses, the Greens return by 6 per cent (previously 8.7 per cent) to the Schweriner Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented on the country day with 3% each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin House of Deputies elections (option 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Deputies with 14%.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, whereas the pirates would miss the invasion in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-Mail and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilo and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clever.
The built-in storage was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "Büro in Westentaschenformat".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was to reach the communicator.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although painful slowly.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded like a laptop.
Then found a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was fairly proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could expect in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile space experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market dominates suppliers, all coming much later than Nokia.
Being online always and everywhere, this is today for very many people everyday.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, including 555 million pieces on Samsung and Apple alone.
The global turnover of the devices is about 400 billion euros.
These include the well-current operations of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, then Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator to easily use everything via touch screen.
Apple's victory began, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the lookout.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Telling now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a naturality 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now watches his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff at the Siemens Executive Board.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and all over London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the largest attraction of Heathrows, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teaching stations alone, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The two were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked to him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in social growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of the GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which was elected five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, built in the middle of the two most frequent stages of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while securing our future business and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and Former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and mouse game" about ad blocking
For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid advertising blocking are similar to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post that told users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding its advertisements to make it more difficult to recognize advertisement blocks of which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her struggle between the advertisement blocking Open Source Community and the surroundings has already been underway since the invention of advertiser blockers" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study of Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people use advertisement blockers; almost four times so much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile terminals, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
The company has it on display blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile ads blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertisement on desktop PCs represents a sufficient proportion of revenue, so that Facebook seems to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preference tool" to have more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we are planning to address the problem," a Facebook speaker informed in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a dumb means, so instead we have focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Women driving in suspicious suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman died in the early morning hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49 who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police asking them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, informed Gilles Hofstetter to the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not taken to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year a police officer of negligible killing was released after she had driven over and killed a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was "a perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, the Venus was probably inhabitable once.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to climate researchers.
The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could have experienced a precarious condition with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, pervasive atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to protect the surface from a large part of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was probably inhabitable once, the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions of years.
Their oceans were dampened and their water vapour was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect left behind -- the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to too little participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
During the summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with the vision of the organization.
He must also have a right of participation in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the League during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell back behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference with five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start talks again, strike out
The labour struggles regarding the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties to the conflict stand on the table for a new round of talks, said the negotiating parties.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were carried out sporadicly on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Units and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few whole-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin in the beginning of next year to address the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its Mega Merger with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure, due to the lower oil prices, to a stronger economic situation, as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest working disputes that have taken place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and all over the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the crowd of stars of the Plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the crowd of stars of the Plejads.
The new data helps the astronomers to understand why stars in the crowd of stars rotate at different rates and in what connection the rotation periods are with the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other crowds of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The crowd of stars of the Plejads is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this crowd of stars, which were born about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
You're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars throw out large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun spots --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars of slower pirouets rotating than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejad we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the crowd of stars of the playas is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The crowd of stars of the Plejads offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how how how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejads, which will soon be published in the astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star descends
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the tricot of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say goodbye to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, Rodriguez won the World Series with the Yankees.
Since 2007, his signature under a ten-year contract gave him 27 million US dollars each year.
By the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will be a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the celebrity hall of baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - the nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so his appearance is controversial outside the square.
Already in 2009 the Superstar admitted to taking banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked up for 211 parties in the so-called Biogenesis skandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect for years of receiving power-promoting funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the blockade was further reduced to 162 encounters.
"The League could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said suffocating.
His farewell days don't go without noise either.
While many baseball legends in their last games get the big stage again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include farewell tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and who was told to have a relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy statements from the fans of the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Hit: Due to a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A captured athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre trailer Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight raiser Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - right before the start of the critical light athletic competitions, these news come to the tide.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already proven to be used as a masking agent for doping substances.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had played fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the advances over 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing with the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations from Chen", quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news about the positive test at Danekowa was squeezed through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive", this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the light athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B sample is expected to have already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight raisers from the chronic doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the anabolic steroid nandrolon, like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but they must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, the Danekowa case is another heavy hit for the reputation of the whole sport.
The IAAF World Association had banned the launch of the complete Russian team, except for an exception because of systematic dopings, and the leasing Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the previous crimes in China had also led to intense conflicts between athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinket purple."
"If I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to vomit," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," said this.
In 2014, Sun had been tested positively with the stimulans of trimetazidine in the Chinese championships, but only a three-month lock had to be placed.
Data clause: So perfide blackmail hackers their ransom
Repressive malware programmers are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by the Malware Defense Specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies interviewed have been at least once in the last 12 months, partly several times victims of an attack with expressor software.
In Germany, nearly 20 per cent of companies were already targeting ransomware extortion.
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the perpetrators to re-use the attacked systems and data.
The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malware bytes looking at attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the offenders discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place terribly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, she is looking specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are talking about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
As a result, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business, and in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data back.
For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of a stop in the operation.
The hackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The offenders are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to collect more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, set freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free example files.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get back their data unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from ransomware extortion, hackers become increasingly professional and share their work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus Provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware within about one week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software box to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.
The blackmailers then search for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in in one of the forums underground, buy the set from one criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made by a pro-infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then commission spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to protect Ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
As a result, the offenders are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful erosion, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, according to the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.
In the future, the offenders could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V works rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the fund, it does not work in any place narrow.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top drops something.
More versatile than comparable vehicles are the HR-V at the storage room.
There is not only a case room of 453 l for high and 1026 l for rounded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a kinosessel and thus provide storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The suitcase can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The 1,6-l diesel tested with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work slightly quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is delightful.
There is another engine: a 1.5-l petrol tanker with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more straightforward.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because when ranking, he judges many obstacles as "approaching objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the smart speed controller responds to the traffic signal recognition and speeds if necessary.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI box are under the armrest and are therefore something understandable to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petroler from EUR 20000, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Drop on Passenger Bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical of aviation, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (see 18 U 124/14).
The applicant had broken a knee disc during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general life risk, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man compensation.
Sickness: When does the organizer pay?
Sick holidaymakers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family had severe diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkey leave.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
Their disease led the holidaymakers back to a defective cleaning plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the journey had been defective - and complained against the organizer.
The applicants had no success before the Court.
Although the cleaning plant was defective in fact.
However, the organizer did not learn from it until shortly before the applicants left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
In particular, no contamination was found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly through infection among themselves - is a general life risk.
Of 691 guests only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
The State must make a clear and determined response to terrorist threats at the same time.
Surely, our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
But if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the people's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Federal Day Election.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of the security forces, namely "in average four-digit size over several years".
There must be a penalty for sympathy advertising for terrorism again.
The aim is to improve video surveillance, to renew the arms law so that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made difficult.
According to de Maizière's words, the most recently discussed obligation of silence for doctors should be respected.
However, in dialogue with the medical community, he wanted to find solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, for example, with regard to mental remarks.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care to be necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
In order to prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of Interior has made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was an ear fog for the CDU/CSU makers," Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Radio Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected reputations from the Union following a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
He considered that a general prohibition of complete secrecy was constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to carry the Burka.
You could talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter presented to the minister that he wanted to simulate action and capacity with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotten of proverbs and a strengthening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the highway feeder
It is regularly disturbed on the surrounding road - here is a picture of November.
However, this should change: the right-wing track should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in professional traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the stau when they drive over the motorway transporter (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16th-17th August) the road construction company extends the right track by 700 metres in the area between the Hammer Straße and the departure Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then penetrate directly from the Hammer road to the right.
The great advantage: Transport is divided up earlier, improving the overall flow on the multi-purpose section of the 51 Federal Road.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group represented in the district of Münster-West.
The slope on the trailer makes the drivers nervous especially between 17:00 and 19:00.
Working day the back stack extends to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle lor on the B 51 just before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only one-separated across the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt a few months ago.
The reason: statistical calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary viability to initiate heavy load traffic in a two-purpose manner.
As long as this shortfall and the associated working day stash will last, the competent country company cannot say.
However, years can be expected: the bridge has an official residual life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-wing track, the national company has deliberately chosen the less time in the school holidays because of the expected handicaps.
The traffic will be passed by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning piece "The invisible house" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Trip" initiated by the Association of Nima, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the stage in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to choreographies, scenic images and video animations, they could have been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the next playtime in the context of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without the background of escape and migration between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dancing, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects to be involved in many classes.
Rain instead of star snugs: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-snuffing lookers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night had been badly suited for watching the sky scene because of clouds and rain, said the president of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies at night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll probably see many star snakes in the sky.
The star whips are persids, which are among the fastest star whips at 216,000 kilometers an hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the star image of Perseus that rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, in the night you'll be awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep long before the wake-up ring.
That's all other than relaxing.
After all, one is in good society with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not recoverable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders speak?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of reasons behind them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, Executive Board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what you understand on the land below is insomnia, i.e. insomnia and insomnia.
It is just sleeping that many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German Housekeepers Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.
Not rare sleep disorder is expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is frequent, especially in the event of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, whoever has a band disc incident may be poorly placed, wake up every two to three hours, and possibly begin to dig about everyday problems and concerns, gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you are not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by day, you should go to the doctor's advice.
The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten down, tired, unsleep, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical discomforts such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
In Germany, there are hardly any sleep doctors who are left behind," stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, when sleeping problems occur, you should first contact the doctor, says Weeß.
He can investigate if the problems have a physical cause.
Who was supposed to go to the sleeping lab, and what's going on?
For example, doctors advise to study in the sleeping lab in snorkeling with breathing triggers, sick day fatigue, sleeping converters, or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder, fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Please don't sleep lunch," says Fietze.
After cableing, you go to bed at normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a nose glasses, a chest belt and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera records the sleeping ends on the ceiling.
How can the affected cope with the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts: regular sleeping and resurrection times, not sleeping too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has made a statement on Facebook about the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympia.
In December 2014, he first picked gold at the short-sea world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting himself from his former teammates in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives a premium of €20,000 and a jungle king of €150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming is bad, while the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote very much and do not look at or even operate doping so closely.
"I do not say that checks should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is exactly what we should do with countries.
"Who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain time before WM/OS, must not participate," the Hamburger, who now operates an ice dye.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civil guards of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thieves as bands.
At 21:30 a.m. civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from previous theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several delicts since mid-July of this year and had been involved in joint, part-time and particularly professional activities.
The Specialists of the Crime Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had traveled specifically to Germany to commit crimes.
In total, they had earned more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few Linden trees, between the rest of a headstone plaster: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work that at first glance, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you can pass to playgrounds, a freshly-drawn kindergarten and a bioshop.
Somebody sprayed on the facade of a grey house.
On the other hand, a Lidl, which will soon be cut off, is already built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built.
However, articles about this "trend district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred to be photographed with burning cars in the last few weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the inhabitants have now rented, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly expressed his support for the police's hard action against the project, called the area "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, after the spaces on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrouilled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners.
On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers retired under the joy of sympathetic and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the bargain in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the home projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly angry with the police presence.
They share with the residents of the house projects the concern for rising rents and certification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who, most of them, wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbours does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the home projects that were born are also part of Kiez for a long time: in 1990 numerous houses in the former DDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer road very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared under a large police command in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them now residents from DDR times and former housekeepers share their kiez.
This is also noticeable for rents which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 when renting new ones.
Many of the new constructions in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are detected in cast discs or freshly removed façades thrown with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbours view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes involve material damage that tend to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is controversial: people in 94 are their neighbors, who certainly have not been.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in the Rigaer for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
New builders have consciously moved to the Riga street - and remained.
That is why it was so important for her that the residents would get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the supremacy over the district in July.
However, in the eyes of residents such as new builders, the road continues to be removed from them: through faceless new constructions in former building gaps that suppress the old residents.
"These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well-kept here," she says.
"I can't approve of the lawsuit and destruction."
But what should you do if anyone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for attracted people who are annoying about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Whoever moves from here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee representative
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's customer from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milk sauce, which has a problem.
Thus, some - less spotting than rather targeting the variety of desired tasks - had meant that the administration wanted to call the job.
An administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, was sought.
However, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.
It is mainly about organization, working with people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50 % station to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Customer, "that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and senior officials.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem for some time has been finding homes for the refugee who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dwellings.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility is changed from the Land Council Office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every tenant wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not function until now, as Deuschle says, depend on private apartments.
Therefore, municipal dwellings must be dressed, as it is called so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments is not done.
The perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine Customer.
Many work in the building or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very well, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work will lead to a positive external impact for the community.
That's "no employment therapy".
However, activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too, administration and honoraries jump in.
It is essential that refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They must tell the refugees that it just takes and they can usefully spend time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who don't have anything to do with it." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivating others.
All of this is a "mammut job".
A difficult question: are the two after the recent events afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Customer quite clearly, "what some may call naïve." A residual risk could and does not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are already aware.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the killers will bring them into disobedience.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So chief and honorary officials on site and in the region must look out for activities.
They always have the background that soon a new strike of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is terrified.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"In Urbach we haven't reached where we were going," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already exploited with the rational integration of the previous people.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruders with helicopters searched
The police helicopter flew away different areas for about an hour - without success.
Two unknown men entered violently in an apartment in a multifamily house on the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 pm.
The resident surprised the two and struck the unholde to escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wore both bluejeans and black capuchon pullis.
They fled to the city center.
For the search, the police set up several strip crews and a police helicopter.
The search went without success.
Perhaps the unknowns noticed before the act near the apartment or when they escaped.
