Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A crazy institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A mine chapel, where is now digged for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories at the time.
It's nervous when maps aren't up to date.
Everyone who had to get upset knows that because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a contour road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the Bavarian geoportal of the state government, are all other than current - but that is precisely why it is very informative.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a tiny carpet that you don't know as such.
In the large map, more detailed maps, so-called "urposition sheets", were included for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Measurement Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and stem from the first Measurement of Bavaria.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Colaliation War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801 finally departed: It was today's neighbours who created the idea of a covering Bavarian card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Administration.
The original post for Munich is from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek, like all others.
The comparison Earlier/Today is the most striking example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is the subsequent who still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was communalized 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877, as the district of Munich.
Today, the subordinate is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Undersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing is seen as fields - at first glance: When zooming in the way, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-digited corridors from the so-called "output" from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer a farmer - but a small gardener of the "land in the sun" plant.
A large green area is distinguished north of the subsignant.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 stage of the October Festival, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the height "Auf den Luften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeld road, people were once locked up with delusions.
There was 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Venten".
From 1872 onwards, Dr. Bernhard of Godden led the establishment of that psychiatrist who was associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called crazy.
In addition, he has banned staff from applying violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the Institute.
For 280 patients, the first place was, later, extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Circle Irrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper clinic is located in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatries.
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west lies the football court of the TSV Munich East, eastern residential homes from the 1980s.
In 2015 the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural direction of the original building of the Insane Centre, which had been destroyed during bombing attacks in World War II.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War into the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies broke many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big thing remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval mining chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the spat stitch for the second S-Bahn stairway were done.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with today's air image - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Citizens' Rights Group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to take extreme care, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recent law adopted by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and the law enforcement authorities of the state, which are disproportionately targeting minorities, have prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequencies that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during his trip through the state and was detained by Missouri police without being charged with any crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are more frequently stopped than white drivers.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people must be willing whether they bring security or let relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which rank the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the Schwendemann family courtyard, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV president of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "elementary importance".
I can't make profits on such sparse lands.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, a lot has to be processed with the engine sense.
"We have to fight with the conditions and with the topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parent farm and manages it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not run a bio farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased with the Leader support".
If the costs range from €3 000 to €4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this would allow for a long period of time to be taken out of the foresting of the land.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised by the promotion
A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were collected from the Weidezaun promotion in 2013.
The opening area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be harvested by at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half was funded via Leader, and one quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained EUR 12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the teeth," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed, "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women can't do it."
Peter Weiß also stated: "Here are the best foods produced".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for weidezäunen.
The aim is to open up the Black Forest.
The presence of a promotional scene designated by the LPR is a prerequisite.
In addition, the area in question must not be manageable for sleeping (hing over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares and the estimated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more holy?
Now the White House of Trump takes up the statue of freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciated this as well as any other - so the worrying fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axt in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the status of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lyed him if he had done it.
But he attacked their importance, and especially the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.
When Miller Acosta slandered: "I don't want to talk about a whole story here, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller is actually right, but as he made it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the upheaval words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your crowded masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the misery waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time in which the "sliding waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they did a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by representing the feminine embodiment of freedom in an exploited classical image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American natism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010, that the statue of freedom is not invited to anyone but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the nighttime world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the fence of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The flock should not illuminate the way to the United States."
It's pretty unusual that Limbaugh hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginary act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their fakes should not illuminate the way, but inflamm the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotlands belonged to the UK team
The performance director of light athletes of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "it has developed something special in Scotland" and the UK's light athletes have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British light athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will arrive against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"A series of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will join her fifth world championships at the 400-m-hurds, says that it is "unreasonable" that 16 Scotlands are in the British team.
The best total number of athletes in Scotland was seven in the World Championship, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-street runner Muir is heading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another shot, which you should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other shot in Lee McConnell team was.
The team captain says that she is "enormally proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also involved in medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scotlands that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get up on podies.
As far as my speech as captain is concerned?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just gonna be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate electorate heating
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He shyed in the criticism, certainly.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed - and, stupid and stupid, we are brought to battle like the sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff resigned the complaint as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counterreaction with "Now, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come on the Governor's side - which is a public forum which is officially referred to as and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spams or hateful people who swing the pie online.
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hatred crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the "The Post" message.
"I do not appreciate this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are rather ignored by some rather than a so-called collective engagement and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "for language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical key items or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for having slandered Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers came into his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers that disbelieved Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are among the foundations of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led to the final round of the Archerfield left next year before losing Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament messenger on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it reaches its reputation with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he found this place.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to make it good, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad to see how it has gone."
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with one inmate and £ 10 per car with two or more inmates.

Less lung cancer due to passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and more people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
To this end, scientists from the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital (UKE) will study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases per year are due to passive smoking," said Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he started a study on this subject in 1994.
At that time there were 400 lung cancer cases in Germany due to passive smoking per year.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are in some way in time", says Fred Heinze, the head of the construction site.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as much is hidden in the underground, which is not included in the plans.
The traffic, which always hampers construction, poses a major problem for Stumpp's construction team.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and lockouts is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to transit.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have already been very busy.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the unrestful Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coaled knob is taken and swallowed with jealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course late work can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.
"None dare to walk around in the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which took place in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public survey before the crew forces.
An existing movement against the Dutch rule of independence quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as distant as it is destiny. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning car ride by car.
There are no public transport means.
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo foams, and wave sheet roofs, converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, not to mention journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degei and suggests their lively, handwoven turban, their dark shirt and their bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and alphabetisation rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport reduced its value of US$3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated US$78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars to local military members and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papua demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s were made to genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" says in a report by the Archdiocese Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric blows are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian Researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the populating islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning cannons sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with strawberry sauce.
Local people fight to stay here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in the province capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the local Papua - the mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former roomman secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The scared children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers hit their sound and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was fired and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football court in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in the circle continuously and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago stem.
Some demonstrators began to slew stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was warmed, the soldier was sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening to the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only wears a name, TIME in dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted only to "safe" their station because she was attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he set up a non-judicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses almost started immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all will be regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of "criminalities against humanity", who called for more than 1,000 deaths in the bloody independence vote of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai sacrifices accepted such claims with gross incrédulity.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company, who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Enthusiastic villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by fireing warning fires.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness of how the injured were quickly brought in here, according to the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to take account and withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "safety of national sovereignty".
Some don't ever show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Broth is also out of reach.
The people here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupies (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills necessary to lead their own companies competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribe council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting of international media remain tight.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign to lift the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development has not been realised.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report about Indonesia's unrest eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the Group's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights cases."
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take this into account.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him to "we want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to participate in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuas say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribe council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuas, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site in front of the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with reduced head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' cloud scratch of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire was found in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high, 79-storey building.
It's the second fire that will flow through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up in the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor," said a resident who named George Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said the firefighting units were extinguishing the fire at 4:00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooling the building.
The government said that it was working on providing accommodation for the people concerned.
The incident can relaunch questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damages came from the disguise, the external disguise to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disguise at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has gone through with his large Davis Cup Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chhi-Minh-Stadt, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup single was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-seat classics, often very long, but also very appreciated for that reason, are thus retained in the tradition competition.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the objective of ITF President David Haggerty was hardly missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
It will continue to work to improve applications.
After many objections, not until the vote, the proposal had been made to deliver the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 onwards are only relatively smaller details: So the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to comply with less official media deadlines before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited items into the plane, find out a survey
A flight passenger survey showed that more than 20 percent of the aircraft were smuggling or unconsciously banned items at the US Transportation Security Administration control points, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other objects with sound.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they were mistakenly travelled with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers rather ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most frequent items that were deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted to carrying sounded objects through security control, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs to the aircraft.
The company said it had asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many smuggling goods accidentally brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggling goods - knowingly or ignorantly - through security were those who fly the most often.
However, the company points out that TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they may take or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confiscated by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while the people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric-Tunendsassa Elon Musk likes to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
To date, he has pointed out that some of the customers have withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphing figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time reported a different, less glossy figure: those of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months Musk had often received more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Criticists have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla reimburses the 1,000 euros (in the United States 1,000 dollars and in the UK 1,000 pounds) "reservation payment" fully.
Currently, 455,000 of these non-binding reservations were available, Musk opened a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 it is supposed to be - all models combined - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is evident.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently available per day.
Whoever orders today a "Model 3" can expect delivery at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its nail-new, never-tested production roads without major interruptions with maximum utility.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are greater delays, the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For then, the company cannot prevent unsatisfactory customers from running away in crowds.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the delay in the implementation of Obama Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he had been charged by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, revoked his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of Smog-producing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a Federal Appeals Court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for States to comply with 2015 standards for ground-near ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time, to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly hampered or delayed regulations against which the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are opposed.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal backlog for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Appeals Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turn-over to ozone standards simply strengthen the EPO's readiness to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused by activist groups and others, and, in an agreement, set the deadline for implementation," Pruitt said, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority we have seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its "power to delay and all other legal powers" to ensure that the rules "based on sound policy and best available information".
The Republicans in the Congress insist on a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved in the last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that accused the EPO this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smog flowing into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection were delighted about Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crossroads of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery-areal in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility a popular place to stay.
Visitors of the sixth Benefiz series can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen to their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a unique local little town."
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was for the first time mentioned in the Württemberger documentary: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the on-site parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Master Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
In addition to the former church of the parish, the text of the document also stood on the Tumlinger Mountain, and not vice versa.
So there were also people living there.
As the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in Tumlingen's locality, was the "berg" of the third, magnificent settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical circumstances.
The Patronate Law was born from the Early Middle Ages Church Law.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
The right to establish a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop was associated with this.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two was broken at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later in World War II was released in 1942.
During the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were struck and the cliffs were stolen.
The roof was flat.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used them as a firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to crash in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof served as the last resting place for the dead from listeners.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was broken down.
Only the church tower was left.
On the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm collapsed the church tower and half fell.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower dwarf still present today remained a witness to 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, Tumlingen's friends and supporters invite to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery to the St. Hilariu chapel on Sunday 16 July.
This is formed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium's Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local Chief Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme begins at 4.30 p.m.
It's at 3.30 p.m.
For the serenade, a retreat in front of the cemetery takes place.
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers show the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and listeners.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to check the approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim is opposed" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, no wind power plants could have been approved, since at that time there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border of Schwalmtal in Foursen.
Within this concentration zone, wind power plants can be built and operated in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent "saving" the landscape.
Although the City of Foursen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, a few days earlier, by amending the land use plan, which was not approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planning legal requirement, the approval decision issued remains illegal and therefore also withdraws," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is opposed".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the City Council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is not yet possible.
Recognition: "This means that the authorisation for the construction of wind power plants is excluded from planning law at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Circle Foursen since last week," said a speaker.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to stop the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not wish to express its views on the argumentation of the "Boisheim opposition" association on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four per 200 metres high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Foursen is indirectly involved, had already signed leasing contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind power plants, the electricity needs are to be covered by around 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Üach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor break together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was injured deadly.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The road remained locked over hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich travelled with her car with her 53-year-old mother as companion to Bogel.
City and dealer plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekends
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the Business Association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shopping" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of the offers that the city offers beyond the usual supermarket goods.
Thus, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the city centre should be invited to the midnight shops.
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
Urban administration and business associations cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Thus the business association and the city go into another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the Brunnenfest, as well as open-ended Sunday, discussions with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-enriched or re-enriched.
These include tourists and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping out of view.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - up to renters, the entire city's businesses and associations.
It applied to overcome with a network the Lethargy, which had partly spread, the king had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK centre in Mühlhausen, announced that the third day of the nationwide home shops, for the first time five Thuringia cities, took part.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy Town and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the public interest of our cities", says Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were wounded.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them severely.
According to the firefighter, on Wednesday (local time), another injured person was in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building crashed in the explosion.
A missing woman was later also detained dead.
The dead were school employees.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday time, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on the payment of the border wall after transcriptions of phone calls in Mexico
Transcriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a telephone call with the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President slandered him because he had publicly accused the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall on the southern border of the United States, and swore that Mexico would pay for the project.
Transcriptions of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an exciting exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was "laughterful", "men" and "double" and that the existence of trade mediated by the Obama government would make him look like a "deep" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees into the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massakers: Activists return to racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury travelled through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came up to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigarette and looked through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n ----r Roger," the man cried.
"Take him out of the car!"
Scream broke the silence when a young black man was cut off from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a replay.
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience threw out very real soaps.
Since 2005, citizens have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lyed by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It is really unbelievable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the post-protection.
"It's a dirt on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congress member of Georgia and a lifelong citizen.
For him, the aftermath serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A court doctor puts a towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one's ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court made it possible for the first time for the black citizens in Georgia to vote during the pre-election campaign in summer.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom took a white land owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and the local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulates it even more prestigious.
"It was a campaigner," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you can register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual aftermath of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their representation is illustrative, touching and is founded in a kind of deep racism of which many want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because we are then confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - pushed into a room and listened to Greene when she started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes Co-Director.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams at Hester and presss him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, "he, go away from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?", asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still sniffing.
"I just don't think white people said "he" then."
"However," whispered one of the other black performers.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts in the room, a feeling of comradeness replaces discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and strongly.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repeat ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays sad Lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
Around a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced almost eight hours of Georgia's pressing humidity when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels splendourous.
When the last notes of the song ring out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children stick on their heads, record the fake blood and the silent bodies and flush to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurates a little boy as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks up crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whisperes one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for one reason."
Later, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta talks about the postage with a black couple that they just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and acts... come from people who look like you and do this because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me, let me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "it is called police shooting today only."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof holds at his table, he eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he started planning the show next year.
"The retrospective is in some ways inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's true if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
"Goddamming" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also set a colorful-frivole scenery in front of gigantic, six-storey scenery.
The turning stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) is a shy street corner, as well as wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parks in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil bags recall Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - that draws through its "ring" scene.
The three Rhine daughters - singing by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as already in the Rheingold.
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), breaks a body in the case room in Hollywood, and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the glorious fiese hagen surrounded by the aura by a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus oak) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski are celebrated stormyly, who bows their hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is a great applause for the festival orchestra, which for the first time appears on the stage - given the great heat again in empty recreational clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was expected to be thrilled.
If he had had had to take over another roaring pipe concert in 2013, five years later there were great joys in which the separate "Buh" calls fell.
Captain Katharina Wagner should have been delighted about it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of its viewpoint.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their year of volunteering.
Where?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've already worked at school all day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're now 26 years old, so a late-employed volunteer.
How's that come?
Quantity: I've done abitur.
And then a construction engineer's study, let's say, successfully discontinued.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, perhaps at the focal point, really.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social study in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training in Herne at the Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it something unusual to have several different sites of use during the Voluntary Service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I think it always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in the engineering study?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in front of your head, each having a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to address it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fears of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's the way life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group said that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediary by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company was facing.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs, the job loss, announced by Director General John Fallon mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is a result of the loss of jobs.
Pearson announced in May, in a third cost reduction program, a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) to revive a business that was made by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its participation in Penguin Random House last month in Bertelsmann's partner, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack of Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide murderer attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, said a NATO statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the Qarabagh district.
Bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide murderer killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
An NATO statement states that the explosion had taken place on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the US military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide autobomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiitian district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they executed this attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombardment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the U.S. military exiled the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in Afghanistan.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses the decision to delay the Smog rules after appeals
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government that states are obliged to limit the emissions of smuggling, which took place one day after 15 states charged the Agency for the action.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "ozone provisions 2015" and said it demonstrates the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the EPA to delay the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, will stimulate economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the reluctance of the democrats and natural protection groups, who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of air that contains ozone can "reduce the lung function and strengthen the respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Communal Council wants Community area
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to establish a community space in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area of the church community has been owned by the municipality, there is no longer any obstacle to planning for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the municipality.
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are asking for such a community space not to be a meeting point only for the residents of the seniors' right to live, but to openly enter the municipality.
As an example, the word of the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget was sweetened by means of grants already in the autumn.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The creation of a Community area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision provides to signal to the investor that in this respect it is not intended to throw a knot between the legs, the finding that both saddle - which is related to the environment - and pultdach - which reduces the height of the drain and makes the construction economic - would be possible.
It is unnecessary, not just Wilfried Sohmer, to say, be this addition.
If it helps, the panel will be held unanimously.
It's not that easy for the Community area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you do not get so well forward, for which you now stand out at the community room, she says, "I'm doing hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area, but absolutely opposed to municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not provide a grant, but it is a real, marketable counter value, the counter-spoke.
Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
Thus, with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises as follows: "If we make this decision, we are making a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is drove on the road
A 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had travelled on the road of the Black Road to Hilden by bike at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the road at Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went to the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter traffic.
He hit a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was drove to the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retoven car.
FC Bayern Munich must renounce David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game suck against Dortmund.
With staff care, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first obligatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the supercup against the pokal winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) the German football recorder Bayern Munich is becoming more and more involved in the pokal winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichs Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti has been responsible for the five defeats in the last six test games for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said and added, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team's ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "tricky, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights pulls the fans into their banners.
The party was sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking from star to star in the resin
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be formed throughout the state.
This is what the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" responds to the need for information from many resin visitors, it said.
It connects nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and to inform them about stars and images.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
The question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented by the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the star path is to be extended to train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," said the club.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colours or why one star was brighter than another, even though it was far further away.
It will also be conveyed to what star image a selected star is in and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the club has been operating the highest star guard in northern Germany in St. Andreasberg.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often there is clear sight of the milk road and even the Andromeda galaxy with a simple eye.
In the University City, there has been something similar to the planned planetary route since 2003 on the initiative of the Global Society of Supporters Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steaks leads up to the Hainberg and the Star Guard - as well as a "external" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are exactly set at the distance and scale from one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a 6.5 millimetres diameter ball, while the exact 75 meters away sun at least measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary route is about four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the steel with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the universe.
The march to the next star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unschlaged World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federal weight championship.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five-pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size".
"I am a former spring weight," reminded Garcia.
"I've risen for Broner [up to 140 pounds] but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweighters [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer a date (37-0, 30 knackouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title campaign in the forum on September 23th.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans asked for him," Garcia said and later opened up to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best ones.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "a huge fighter," and he might be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko held on to the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought that the three-fighting champion from Riverside would look very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out.
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then box.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I waited for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by pneumatic pitcher
In the event of an accident at the A7, four persons were severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control over his vehicle shortly before the connection point market wide after a tyre pitcher.
The car slid right into the bush, where he crossed and then stayed on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour and then the traffic could be passed on the left road at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "The three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after 2:2 to start the season against Braunschweig, the optimization of the defense formation will bring points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first seasonal game, and the result would not have been the two counter gates at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two countergates too much, and we have to take even better care in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defence player.
In the ore mountains, the three-chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a freehead will no longer catch the fortunes.
"For the future it will be that no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience of preparing the three-chain, his team will be better off than the four-chain.
"I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we just have players in the three-chain semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The condition is that we harmonize even better and we do not afford so many playoff errors in the structure."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a misleaded start after an indeterminate, you don't know.
The performance could be fine," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the pokal, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season opening."
His coach didn't want to know about it.
"I'll only judge the start in the season after six to eight games days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage to Aue, just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be interrupted early because of a weather.
"Now they can start the season with almost a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, "that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know where they are currently," says Fortuna's internal defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting as an easy favorite on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"It's nonsense that we beat them out, just because we have the claim to get among the first six," says Funkel, whose balance is very positive when only one defeat against the Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the outset," Fortuna's chief coach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are over 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "propose that the person investigated is 18 years or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A scepticist is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through the puberty earlier or later.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
To assess biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told Metro.
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is a good step forward.
On Wednesday a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going super," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April the work started at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction end is scheduled for October and easy is sure that the timetable is respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete wave-bow bridge, dressed with red color sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure resilience and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges run over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red color sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 or 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach now on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge fixture, which is also used as an operating path.
In the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metres wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The particular thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip feeling has required the placement of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber glass cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by means of a handbook.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished out first.
For the bridges between the building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is individually regulated by a light.
For the construction of the bridge at Lauterbacher Orteingang, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully blocked.
The total cost of the three bridge saneringen is EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It is not so often that parties are pulling a line, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to put under one hat.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district day (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that is peacefully flagged this day, because the AfD invites to the poster "Great Campaign" in Gerolstein City Hall Rondell.
And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the Federal Day election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who have been on site hours before the event starts don't want to listen to the AfD-learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picknick was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, President of the Forums A world and one of the most important organizers, really enjoys: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "German potato salad, which the AfD could also eat easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she also shows presence at the station, which is just a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcaneifel reported that he had tried to get such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there had been a rejection because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
In view of the event at the Rondell court, he says, "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: At 8 p.m. on the Rondell front, a band provides entertainment, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rhineland-Pfalzian AfD president Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Federal Day election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch to hold her speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but until now the officials have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour will take the AfD event, the guests on the front court have a longer breath, but also there is a short time after 2 p.m. clean up.
The police can bridge - no special events.
Posaune meets Trumpete
A rehearsal with Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the Haslacher Monastery concert series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8:00 in the Monastery Church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balcan Folklore" meets a classic German training with roots in bubble music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top-nocesters.
Petkov Solotrumpeter is the famous concert building orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzecho prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free games blend into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core piece of the programme was only launched this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is consciously involved in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," said Kristen Stewart openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, "Oh that was cool, what's next?"
The best known relationship of the Hollywood star was Robert Pattinson's "twilight" team, who finally bitterly broke up.
Despite all this, the brunette performer assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with every one I date.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Christen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and believed dualism.
So it has never made me confused or hindered.
I just never liked being taken seriously."
In particular, she suffered from this, according to "Bang Showbiz", but in schooltime, when she preferred to dress like a bubble: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bob.
I felt really attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, 'Family, be proud of you.'
Especially to the public, she doesn't like to explain her love life: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that irritates me.
And maybe some call me unthankful, but I don't like to have to justify myself before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a meeting with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ...Today, as a resident of West Virginia, I will tell you that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The gathering broke out in joy.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a trainer, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally before.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not accept the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal mines in five states, and he inherited a coal business by his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The change of party of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would stop us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, agreeing message," said RNC president Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of light athletes, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeatedly said that it was not the moment for the country to get back to sports.
Russia's Leichtathletik-Chef Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress, on the eve of the Leichtathletik-Weltmeisterschaften, that the banishment of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away gold and silver medals during competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the continuation of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reuse Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The key principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral players in the light sports world championships, starting in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The Head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for resettlement.
Drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free to work,” he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Trauerful act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in North Hesse Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security arrangements.
On the unexplained cause of crash, Minister of Defence Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two dead pilots as the "Kunner of her trade".
"We resent ourselves for this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died in West African Mali on Wednesday one week ago.
Their scarves were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a death guard of the Federal Army.
At noon only the members of the church said goodbye.
Afterwards the funeral began in the family circle, closest friends, representatives of the Federal Defence and politics.
Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were also included.
Sad guests lay down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the särgen.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
The Minister of Defense of the Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and operating experiments.
The Chief of Staff had built the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger-Pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersach, commander of the regiment, to whom the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew could not turn away the crash, then no one could have".
Conflict on the UN mission in Mali, Minister of Leyen did not show that the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the screams were brought out of the Dome.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Defence did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a tomb next to his wife
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was communicated to the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is added to the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophag for the two.
The queen agrees with the decision of her husband, further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be joined in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hail of his unhappy title.
After his wife Margrethe became a throne in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
In 2016 he retired and also released the title "Prinzgemeihl".
Since Henrik in Denmark had not received the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death," said Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last retreat of the 83-year-old will eventually be, be still unclear.
He did not intend to be joined in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse at the French Embassy.
During his later wife always flew to the people's sympathy, Prince Henrik had a heavy position in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swinging, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk strumpes instead of tricking, citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of more socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for reluctance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That were just two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP by possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has lost the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the country's day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday we voted for the resolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MP from her country day group in Lower Saxony had put the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country-day election, the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its close majority of one vote in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens MP Each Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
President of the CDU Group Björn Thümler would like to recommend that his group accept it.
CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony country day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was reversed.
The new country day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green government had to decide now whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the country day decides its own resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the day of the country will withdraw the Prime Minister's confidence and elect a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally cleanly," said Thomas.
"You will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curios".
The politician himself stressed, "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a follower of Black Green.
The Greens called on the abstinent MEPs to return their country-day mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she returns her country-day mandate, which she has received via the green country list, with immediate effect," said the country presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group President of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We are extremely sorry for the decision made by each of the Twests."
She decided consciously not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Lower Saxony Green Deputies Each Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to allow the country day to be re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil, "in her violated jealousy and frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country."
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and attempts to beat political capital."
Lower Saxony's CDU Group leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend that his MEP include every Twest in the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Group in the Bundestag, forged Twesten to distort the outcome of the 2013 Land Day election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at that time, but SPD and Greens had a ugly majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewing the editorial network of Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the Länder submit the latest information on the egg charts concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at present, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the informant is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the Länder.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned on and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it has become known that Germany is concerned.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe for health.
If the maximum residue content of 0,005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the companies are not responsible.
Are production companies and consumers sitting on the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they must expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service undertakings.
As always, there are seriously too few controllers.
Is there only a lack of staff or of consistent competence?
It was the official checks that revealed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
This is why consistent information on such events and the transfer to the prosecutors are crucial in cases where criminal offences may occur.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to be informed of this.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and transportable foods.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly angry.
The cash pool has led manufacturers, distributors and consumers to a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Basically, it must be clear: the illegal use of the fipronil insecticide in the holding of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the situation will be clarified quickly and inevitably.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unobstructed spending of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's World Track Transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play Rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of Neymar's financial aspects moving to France.
PSG can certainly relax the money so that Neymar can sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich reign family of Qatar.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they must countertax with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the same point in their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who had taken over huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively deceived and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential and then strongly invested in improving the team and building a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP planning period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And even though Platini was disgraceful in 2015 by the Presidency, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be in favour of discouraging excessive expenditure.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the purchase-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption sum can be reported in the financial statements for the next five years at EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (82 million dollars) later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by bloating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the World Cup Organisation Committee 2022.
But PSG and Katar in 2022 disputed that Neymar will become a WM Ambassador and that such a manoeuvre could be easy to find out for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, told the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish League was clearly annoyed to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's withdrawal by claiming PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish newspaper AS with regard to Katar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet co-operation is ahead of a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday, at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier of Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red-white packed skirts of 14 grams per year distributed the crew to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Industry insiders, according to "Nordwest Switzerland" the order volume is estimated to be 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around a billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a Schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
How many candidates there are in the new tender, the Swiss do not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.
The Swiss have distributed chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut, in cooperation with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
The possibility to place the logo started Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The company works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, first class customers are savoured by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class drunk passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short track, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Light athletics - Diskus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches the World Cup Final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, failed in the national World Cup award and could only look at the Diskus competition from the Tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final struggle.
Nostalgia goes to the Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This rehearsal of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s, for the 1990s-grounge era (when the predenators David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch-Comody "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parodie and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaker of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By steaking up on the core of the gag - actors of middle age playing cool children who grow up - they still made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parodie goes more according to the principle of casting cans, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that shakes the scale").
At one point a character hits through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novel author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-malicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's particularly fun to see the everlasting young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lipstick of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
It's the moments of random madness that could heated this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series, until he achieves what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene the bands will show how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West Ringkamp iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director states to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a tough Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an exporting producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a genius idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to show (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes it moves down, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited at a lesser length, could better deliver his Agitprop satares, since Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who swallow a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a team.
The fictive Romanian Creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and with their own.
Clash against drug mafia in the country
The police succeeded in a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Attorney General Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years of age and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured more marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested in Italy in the event of simultaneous racing.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action was carried out by Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 policemen were in service.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Attorney General investigates Konstanz against the organized drug trafficking in the South German area.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a strong exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the major operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In particular, Italian nationals with a close link to Italian mafia came to the attention of the surveys.
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning, is expected to go to the account of the bands.
Wise complains big gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigner register in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "particularly serious errors" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis available in the South German newspaper.
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are reported to be included, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
Thus, the data are managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the quality of the data in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases data from 1921 were found, "from people who have long been out of life, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register".
"Error data inputs can significantly slow return processes," says the report.
The statistics on persons subject to exit also include EU citizens who do not have to go out at all.
Such false assignments, however, led to a "distorted debate on dealing with persons who are expatriated", so it is stated in the analysis.
In the meantime, the federal government apparently began to return refugee families with children under 16 years of age to Italy when they entered the country.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper thus states that the BAMF is conducting such procedures "on families with children - except for infants and infants - again to Italy since 1 June 2017".
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Convention, refugees from the EU Member State are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this State may send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Convention.
The speaker of the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children threaten human rights-free reception conditions and a threat to the well-being of children because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the municipal council meeting, the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to give blood.
"It's brilliant how our body is designed to do so and we're still inappropriate to respect the donors who make their blood available to strangers," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, Circular readiness leader, as the preserves are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRC head of preparedness.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already before, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times each 500 milliliter of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have alleviated speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "successful" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee's political decision-makers (MPCs) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 %, with less members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in autumn.
But she signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to reduce the inflation heated by Brexit, and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the mammut economic package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources to banks from next February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
With regard to interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and a "something more" extent than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would take place "steply" and "limited".
The Bank's downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared with the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these messages.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision does not change since the recent disappointing growth rates have dampened the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will slightly recover after the bank by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the worsening is becoming worse before it improves.
She added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot "prevent" income loss, but she added that wages will recover "evidently" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditures.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the fall of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this is fully achieved by prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had risen, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and will retract in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its target of 2% was "all" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, since lenders want to look loud for business and finish the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages are closed, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) taken before sexual trafficking, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now provided by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He expressed his willingness to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a judgment by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "determining moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV medicines taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious subjects.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgeners and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor can also register for possible participation in their local attending sexual clinic.
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This big new intervention should complement and overcoming the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted to needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been purchased, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delay in government implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us to move closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society."
Living the big life: The middle floor and smart designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced itself in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets.
"Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something similar to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a sealed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a middle floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my demand," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a middle floor in which you could stand.
Inventor had to think creatively to solve the mission.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without we had to bend.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but about putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down."
This arrangement enabled the inventor to place two rooms in full height over each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all Joanne bars and glasses.
By perceiving a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Cutable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, furned MDF door.
"It is counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of room and storage room, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide the room with its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and an increased number of square meters from something standard to something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are in a dispute for four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than a half billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one third.
A court case states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul owns worth 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed conciliations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, had excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian inheritance prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years high school, when Paul was still a small child (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property kindly to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, while Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark are, according to Paul, "been bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former member of the AFL Board of Directors and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much", because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "was always hoping for a solution".
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the president's absence of media.
Others have tried and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the media - in the hope of keeping the Chief in a more balanced course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to wipe Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places to convince," said Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control is, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something that we don't know to others - that Trump's Tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one could consistently prevent Trump from causing controversies.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico, which was very concerned with this story, reported in May on the desire of the consultants to provide the President with doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"New and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press releases, especially those with harmful leaks, and that he is keen to find out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone badly gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of shakes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to interview employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that gets Trump".
How did that work?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants still strive for influence.
These invariable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most searched criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be requested and hoped.
The police throughout Europe are sending (virtually) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the searched criminals are naturally unknown, information from the population is hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar of Winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, said Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online applicants have been arrested so far, including at least eleven of them due to information post-publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionary Series'
Some of the most prosperous owners of the West Midlands are again standing at war foot with some determined travellers who have negotiated a tomb drawn from the community to retrieve a field in front of their mansion houses.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the "Millionary Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without having been frightened by a grave excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Anger residents have pushed the council of Solihull, who said that "it was useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passors.
The Council must be forced to implement it by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop this."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have risen this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area."
A speaker of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Forest Hotel Luise becomes.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost at that time and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who arrived in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landrat Office as a collection accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontested in the municipal council at that time.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time.
He should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a three-star category house called Forest Hotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joy city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, Bauschuttcontainer has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work will be done.
The floors were cut out, ceilings were partly cut down, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There's still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large fitted showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "being close to citizens", as Thomas Scherer expresses.
"We want to make a jewel."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included in the amenities.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high city level,” said Schererer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wanted to be wide, explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already held discussions with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Demanded for the level of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly.
Nearly a million euros, he counts.
The external systems are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.
In an indoor courtyard, a large terrace will be available from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affair: U.S. Special Investigator engages Grand Jury
In the Russian case of US President Donald Trump, Special Detector Robert Mueller has reportedly set up a so-called Grand Jury.
The panel has started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first invitations from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian attorney.
U.S. intelligence services have been accusing Kreml for a long time to have been involved specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is on several men who acted in the election campaign as the consultant of the Republican.
According to reports, more and more Trump's private and business environment was also taken into consideration.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Detector Trump personally returned to the centre and investigated whether the President might have hampered justice in the course of the deal.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and decide whether charges are to be brought.
Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to as prosecution chambers.
They are usually activated when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be hired by the Public Prosecutor to invite persons to be heard under oath.
According to the broadcaster CNN, launches have already been issued around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.
Persons who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, it was stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then president Paul Manafort attended the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the introduction showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be initiated at the end in order to decide whether to initiate an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel would be the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern to President Trump.
In the middle of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The theme gives the democrats an opportunity to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.
However, these work in secret as well, he stressed.
The White House supports any action that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "real" way.
The former FBI leader James Comey has said three times that they will not be investigated against the president.
There was no reason to assume that there was a change in this, said the statement.
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump camey had fired.
Due to this casualty, charges against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey announced in June before a Senate committee that Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his employees.
That triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to be released.
Unlike an independent Special Investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate case around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the pressure of the President.
Several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills that would no longer allow the Special Investigator to be dismissed.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has dissolved from the shelves.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, over a billion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometers large, now drives north and will probably take two, three years until it is melted.
It is one of the largest ice giants that have registered researchers over the past three decades with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
There's no danger to humans from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear according to researchers.
However, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shrimp in the region, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a background of facts.
In the opinion of many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now discontinued colony was a part of the Larsen-C-Fee.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The balance of waxes and interruptions was disturbed north of this shell a few years ago.
A complete shell was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It speaks of the fact that the Larsen-C-shell feast is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and may fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and drain the water as much as it results from the melting itself.
However, the loss of the scalp leads the glaciers to penetrate directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of the Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C Shell is the fourth largest Shell of the Antarctic region with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether the Larsen-C-schelfeis would grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not relieve the collapse of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, over the past decades, many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.
This long peak of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees, counting among the areas where temperatures rise the fastest.
CDU wants to pay home to staff
Since it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls for the employers' association to leave to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the Circle Day has won 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves.
The teachers in the circle seem to be very enthusiastic.
Around 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At the moment there are still 50 posts not occupied in the district of Mettmann.
The search includes doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and UWG on the day round and to counter the lack of professional staff in the administration.
The administration is to develop, as the parties wish, "a concept of the acquisition and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract future-oriented candidates' shortages.
The overall concept should focus on the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for cross-country skippers and include a training offensive, demands CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities are recruiting good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The question is of a "competitiveness of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who are sick or old.
So the maximum time to act, so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a faussed surprise on the Circle Day when he publicly questioned the staff cost cover and surprised the other parties.
People want to review all the possibilities that allow a departure from the local employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-related cities - should seek a home tariff," says Völker.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for in the Public Service Tariff Regulations.
The wages are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money exist only if you switch to a higher level that is based on years of work.
However, the tasks of the circle have increased in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago had to be created new spaces in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on protection of prostitutes.
Not least, due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone of NGO rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue if they did not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Innenminister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Save' because their team had effectively worked with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Attorney General Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, salvation of human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can only judge any accusations that are currently being brought after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Saving', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board tube boats that are delivered directly to them by human dealers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the file of the Attorney General, whose content was published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must mainly have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far declared themselves willing to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring "essential changes or obstacles" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors have brought fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- und Weinfest von Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
At hot summer temperatures, the first tour led along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed points of view, partly on towers, from which you could look far over the woods of Pfalz and the surfaces.
Between them there were always longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the point of view reached at the point of view, coupled with "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many height meters were again recommended.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and recurring huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in the open-air inhalator healing sole.
New town was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pearl Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium grasses in wind and weather?
The fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, a profitable business - large stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags included.
This has also been recognized by the first Federal Leagues, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 followed the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to enthusiasm new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure "that there are still several clubs on this train."
The next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the gamers of different clubs compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be more present online on these markets than sending the Federal League team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation are contested at competition level.
At least, as in normal sports, there have been ligs in which the professionals stand against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly needed to get used.
Ingo Froböse has also addressed the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport High School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - e.g. increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frobous also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were lacking.
The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, that is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, this would have implemented EUR 50 million in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million.
In contrast to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Football League, this is little.
However, the e-sport is "not far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are already further.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood player Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport game provider Unikrn.
There is a lot going on in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a subject of teaching, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football Firstliga Associations are now obliged, according to Dutt, to establish an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison Germany is behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Only to fall in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is not enough today.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't keep in mind that it's just soccer staying as it always was."
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
The scandal of poisoned eggs now affects almost all the federal states.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord reacted and took all eggs out of the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are proven not to contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that urge Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was convicted for two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were expelled on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is discontenting.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downwards when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the Attorney General to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility," she said.
"She hasn't shown any repentance."
But Carter's attorney said it was a "horrific circumstance that she completely regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that "there is no day on which I do not regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will bear with us forever," says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "trapped" by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another one to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a car poison of carbon monoxide.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text releases revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stay up, jump out of a building, start yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm it.
Something else was on his seat in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Newer could be seen, he kept the binding assigned to him on the arm.
"The trainer did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner later told, after his first use as Bavarian captain.
Well, the stand could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could interpret Kimmich like that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a leader in the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, debutants and just from the holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you have a lot to trust who you want to keep in mind.
So whoever has been awarded the inheritance of lame can only use a small extra motive.
Kimmich confirmed: "That is what you want as a player: to take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flanked over the field as a mini lame.
Right back, this is now his position, the white bond on the arm you did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this start formation like the one who can best take the rowing.
He gave instructions, tried to guide the unplayed troops.
He had a look at the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (dominated hardly); Renato Sanches by joining the achievements of the Asia trip (doing only on condition); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not to appear negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot.
At least that worked very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy up before the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The prestigious Napoli storm often made it difficult, and Süle also tried to successfully build the game a few times.
Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we had hoped".
But he also showed a good performance at the debut.
Game shift, speed change: "For this style I was also picked up".
As unusually this Bavarian world is still for the new entrances, you saw after the party.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed after a few cramped statements in his back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
In Bavaria, you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Dame
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB-Dame everything good.
The Bavarian Legionary is almost a club colleague of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and joins our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian shower.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It often became unconciliable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rheinland-Palatinate.
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister of Economics Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T-V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the former minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing responds to the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all".
The largest turnaround is seen by Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
Even this year, the Ministry hopes for a plan-making process, and the construction law is supposed to be in place by 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West Circuit Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to start running the route in December 2020, says Ministerial spokesman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims, as suggested by Wissing, to use a Rhineland-Palatinate label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports falling down for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young trainers in the new Master-Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A 1000 Euro premium is provided for the Master's degree and 2500 Euro if graduates become independent within ten years of the Master's degree.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction are quick to create facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff," says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing in the state business mobility, only 29 have been employed.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vize Christian Baldauf refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations, the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in receiving national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as it wants to address the shortage of professionals in the region.
In addition, there is no need for broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies only evaluated network supply in an IHK survey with note 3.4.
They complained about storing Internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, former Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe, where she already left the field after four months because of inconsistencies.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi announced, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a revocation.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with CO2 emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emits diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems for the neutralization of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hiding the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors, which could control the use of so-called off-stop devices to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but are reversing under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused by Volkswagen, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could be a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is a superproportionate contributor to Volkswagen's profits.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a fleet will travel through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
If it moves again to the Isar on Saturday, it will see a large fleet there between flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a usual fleet, with Isar tourists.
In particular, the Baureferat wants to clarify.
On the fleet you can see a large infotransparency.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wrong Love is..." the purpose is to strengthen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild flow.
Last summer, the fleet passed over the Isar, and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon signs, the nozzles of his characters are his brand.
Even with 85, the Argentineian still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years, as an artist, he came through, among other things, as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large round Mordillo figures are tumbled in drawings with the shiny tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the signboard today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, puppy animals and watches, his drooling figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos' most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-footer as a counterplayer.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to come to the cinematographic screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he is more focused on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions reminding of drought and the insects transmitted by the diseases, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has caused much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicater, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicads, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts vacationers, it is also very demanding for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
Highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creams, lights, dealers, vagans or a country servant camp should be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the goal of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, enough perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the government's or the cartel's salary list, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no rest of violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latter are her publishers and inspirers of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a Special Federal Attorney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are discontenting and even though the terrain is now even more betrayal.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all mistrusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 shots, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve Rivers".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.
But on the subject of Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the release to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, since rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoles for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of "rest" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken up with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to his own safety after seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without hitting the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
With the time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-cut investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists from his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she was leading.
He volunteered to admit he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task that you like as a journalist - either this or you play the dumb ones.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and live.
"You don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret start-ups and landing tracks" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-sufficiency.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "think a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no phones were suddenly allowed. Days before, it was known that spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class quarter of Culiacan.
Half of the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were one of the 50 percent of the police officers that the governor himself described as unreliable.
It's been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug bands are actually under control.
For the issue this week Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on government expenditure, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Attorney's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which almost throughout the century ruled all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-ranking cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only a few months earlier would readers have considered Valdez's column as the best-informed source of the kidnapping.
"In the past we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body structure.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office was transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they would never have expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Attorney's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it's his.
Throughout the country journalists have become more loud by writing "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
She has since asked that she be redivided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "rounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco journalism", he wrote that journalists were not only killed by drug bands, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with the organized crime.
Last year, the Media Guard Group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a dissuasive effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of Correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a guideline on the header page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they're chased, as it appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the bargain in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones began to sum up at once.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the boardstone edge they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phones.
The first page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenes cry near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police who kept guards to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces.
"How can you just think of closing," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used tarnung to avoid his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible nose horn of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find out that his sloppy skin was of red brown - and they said she had something of a "unrestful past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the best-kept armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cream Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well preserved state has surprised researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the pansed plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he digged in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock on the spot, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years detecting the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy ground.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this plant eater is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, the dinosaurs are likely to be threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The highly armoured dinosaur used a red and white tarnish to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as counter-assessment, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed you to mix better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully detect it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shovels and armaments about his body.
They discovered the countershade, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the countershade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the size of today's animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the concealing of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use countershat - think of rehes, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Stark robbery behaviour on a massive, highly armoured dinosaurs shows how dangerous the dinosaur robbery animals must have been in the Cree Age," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal's life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when he died, the dinosaur was entered into a river and driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the seabed.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to be spread much further downwards than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved shovel skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and preserved the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early cooking season.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shine a little with your eyes, you might almost think he's sleeping."
The Cream Age was a time when huge theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs went through the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was fallen in the sea after death and mumified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he digged in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's best armoured dinosaurs, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snake to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-length peaks that scratched from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the panzered plant eater was floated through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater funeral of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautrete still covers hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Rocked residues of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that wear the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the shoals on his sole.
In the storm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Near 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometers long staves and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage.
According to the first information of the police, at 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg) connections during a storm, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably also trucks, were interconnected.
There was no information on the exact number of injured persons at first.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A great offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a retreat of about ten kilometers was formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive handicaps - by many gaffers - on the countercar.
The firefighter noted the signs of the drivers who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8 this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on his way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing expecting is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deepened in your work and you've just got a genius thought.
And then, pufff.
Comes the creator and awakens an unanimity or cuts the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the uncapped ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.
"If the offer comes, we will extend it.
It is expected to be available on many other distances in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a train speaker.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without a creator.
However, in order to be able to use them, some conditions need to be met: one needs a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do.
It must also be purchased via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.
And the last thing you need is a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train crew receives a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train crew arrives at the ticket control place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used to the passengers.
"If you want to relax without a ticket control by our train crew, check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their journey time more personal on the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Telecom.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
If you often drive trains, you know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest problems.
Because often, one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card, the identity card or any other document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between the train crew and the passenger, leading to poor atmosphere in the compartment or large space and delays in checking your own ticket and at the end of the day the creator takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it said there.
As no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo...
He posted a picture of Brown's liveless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She left her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a lovely dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and screamed, "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've used to and we can call it typical."
At this moment, I felt cold.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the view of people living in the community and having filled the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning about "the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to get free to free ourselves.
Even though I have the chance to give her an experience in which she does not personally experience an elegant racism, she is not different from the next black female child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad favor to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place facing the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9," she said and notes that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything's come."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado's only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to mind, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of human beings, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death track inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider black-live matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, are identified as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not a confirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity.
"It was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is at stake so much.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is on parole for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway in a demonstration.
It describes the social atmosphere of the area, which it calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she sticks to a song and feels committed to this memory since she went on the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From "Droom" to "Great Wahn": TV readers discuss Bit Gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The theme is hardly cold.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the ones say about the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), the other side comes: "Do not eat man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Great wax!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, and the rest of the business also benefits, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda place with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of rural women always very happy.
We also discovered the hunting for ourselves.
We would like to have a chance to maintain this offer even during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, that is also the case.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers live in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the level of the rent.
But it should not be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where to Shopping Palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, as there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we retain the market hall at least.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above all affordable.
As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Shame, special business is almost out of place, and what's left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
In particular, where is the farm market hall going during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a permanent basis if the bit gallery would eventually actually come.
Or does the spooked Bit-Galerie manage to expel all business from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And a shopping center that's empty doesn't need anyone.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farm market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is broken, another piece of culture will disappear."
An appropriate similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost unremarkably similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst sentenced 35 years of imprisonment after she made secretly classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a matching similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and a dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the Spy Law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was oppressed so much that there was only one picture - a cunning, black-white selfie, in which Manning apparently sits unpleasantly on a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde perch - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarettes and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look.
That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museum became inequality letters friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would actually only a few days after the book was published, would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, twin-twinable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "thing happens for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with its overwhelming signature under it (the "i" in her family name has a heart) called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose foundations have been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hopefully will take with them is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears in the hands with a freephone from the United States' disciplinary coffers such as King-Kong.
"If they call your speech, then they won," it says.
"So never shut your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally yet - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulators, which assemble themselves as hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 " 2, Mannings statue), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee at the University of Oxford searched for killing
A country-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is being sought as a suspect after a man had been thrown in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the records of the Cook County Office Court.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several shots.
A Community Warning System published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detective investigates the stitches as a murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case that is investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the US investigation authorities in any possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to submit to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities would help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a ridiculous tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will close the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been entitled to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK anti-doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap on compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause Russia to be concerned.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must accept publicly the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren to allegedly publicly promoted dopings in Russian sports.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the conduct of doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be resettled.
Aldi doesn't sell eggs before
This was communicated to the business groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure that no health damage could be assumed, as stated in the communication.
From now on only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been negatively tested on fipronil-containing antibodies.
Aldi wanted to make it clear and transparent to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers do not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licencing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases allows Whistleblowers to avoid C-Suite management and direct contact with the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to pursue their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it offers a hot card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so that you can reboot why.
Companies come to realize that you have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber involved in Skandale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments financial engineering website.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber trap in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that enables employees to report bad behaviour.
And when the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The public opinion court has taken over the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience expensive consequences by consumer bouquets, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their business centre.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the business centre, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by managers in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed faster.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree vision into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies started to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations through the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not stop their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which increased the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than previously.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are used only.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools promise third parties to increase engagement and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take measures.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection.
"For if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves," Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of that?
And who don't care why I should? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practice and makes a long day for the browns
It goes on at 23:00 when a lot of UCLA football players speak on one side of the team's new field of exercise on the campus.
Some have removed their tricoto parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are registered for the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real tretmühle for the boys the next three days," Bruins Trainer Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six games in Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal preparations for their opening against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's change of rules, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on her for three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed through it, they stick on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of high class that has already been thrown with footballs, which will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far from coming to think that people rent a room there and then set up to record an exercise.
If you have the video band from an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against counterfeit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party facts verifiers and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fact verifiers who may report the results of the fact review from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US Presidency elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where the French voters were flooded with false stories before the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hate-filled postings quickly as they did before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German statement that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge of the stories of third-party fact-seekers, people want more context to make well-founded decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "connected article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce the wrong news.
Create a Comic Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophary Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I like to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says painfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' extends the time from the Middle Ages to Edward's age and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he was involved.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who has been beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest, I have overestimated my greetings") this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the land and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapekeepers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as "Hunds of years when Aristokrates said "Oh, throw it on the floor".
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that show who possessed what: "You might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that had fought for two families.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Farmer Rebellion.
"There is a record of an uprising that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farmer rebellion began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected to each other?"
Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is presented, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin of stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was digged out).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The men seemed to be quite a fool, always make debts and spend money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote inheritance."
After the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He left a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been recovered from nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Hidden Marienkapelle more than 300 years old in Rhendorf
With the hiding of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhendorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roofmark (show of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there is a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", ask the authors of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhendorf chapel.
"We don't really think this (naturally!)," they write on their website that was unlocked yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In essence, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is true to formulate a lonely promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable self-configuration character."
Finally, they compete with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roofmark and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Each year, early in August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
This week, too.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the attempt to strike.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as in the past, but in the Prime Minister's office.
The discussions, chaired by the Head of Government, were now also attended by the five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
This means that the civilians in the YAS were in overwhelming numbers.
The government is pulling the cliffs in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Navy were dismissed.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan sees as the wire drawer of the popping attempt.
Against 486 people who are expected to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempt to crash as a "God's gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean the forces completely".
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about the increasing "islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifest themselves in the abolition of the ban on towels for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The great cleansing of the army and the security forces are going on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 government servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had shaken the military.
The generals were used earlier than the real lords of the country.
Three times, invoking their role as guardian of the worldly order of state.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least by reference to the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is aiming to advance Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a not-named officer who was looking for asylum from fear of persecution abroad after the strike attempt, the Turkish army will be "full extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Nevertheless, after the cleansing, there are doubts in the Alliance about the willingness of the Turkish army to operate.
The management structures and operational skills are "soft," say NATO diplomas.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides that legal immigrants should be reduced to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the US's way of spending green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Department wants to renovate track for racing huttle
Over the past few months, the future of the racing shuttle had been disputed again and again - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the Maroden route on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the race-steigshuttle in the long term, the Ministry of Transport says that construction on the route will begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the route was about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia railway as an operator already agreed on the technical details.
"This is what the roadmap, the used vehicles and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The race-steig shuttle is to be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The race-steig shuttle is a railway between Ilmenau and Race-steig stations, which is popular among tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route was used by enough people to order it regularly in the future.
The track is also highly constructed in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritated professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest wart and the type of fingernail.
"The people make fun about them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything, from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it's becoming even more worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as timidity.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine properties, the allegations of rape, when one goes to Frigid (hears here: opposing) Farrah, make one the most worrying.
On his website True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just hold a different sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain provisionally at the edge of consumer culture.
But what passes out of the peripheral areas can be very teaching about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them the permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has provoked sexual assault on women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magistrate') is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar ratios).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total subjection.
In other words, they are favoured slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech mode: servants
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney a concept of healthy human mind
It has become a binding wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that the US voters have polarized have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump choosers.
We're all supposed to have our filter bubbles drop.
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in another context that this also poses significant risks.
The left was reinforced by Trump, but the shocking effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the horrific possibility that one day his little lady will no longer throw us off.
However, there is an even more intimidating long-term scenario in which Trump Republican of the right wing "normalizes", which suddenly appear to be a concept of rationality compared to his standards.
Today I find myself attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the mad - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both of which, in fact, appear to be a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurry and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés disappoint a city: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be right to the dream.
Twenty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circular traffic in northern London.
However, the Central Park Karaussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go to it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately, nobody asked.
On the other hand, this week, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop.
This leads not only to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also to pressure the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the shop was apologizing, while I was tired of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, because of the treatment of cuts in his wrists, he was brought to the hospital, which he suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors for a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabins in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who hid in the cabin.
The Attorneys have announced their intention of this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say she is too careful.
The National Prosecution Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When a farmer finds Arnold a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg Schools, the fourth classmen from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissers are going to the high school in the future, four to the real school.
School Director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm but then released into freedom.
To this end, the munter shark performed a musical titled "The Adler in the chicken farm".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and made it sprinkled by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope to make him a chicken broke, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockels who wore cylinders around the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school manager Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals, it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he would feel accepted in his new school.
It followed a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former school manager Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into school shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken time is now over," said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she only hates to leave her students, because it had been a really great time.
Finally, she had been able to rely on the fourth class.
At the end of the year, all students sounded a song of summer and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, informed.
On the morning of August 1, Sithonia, the police arrested a group of illegally celebrating people, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have intensified control over the free camper and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The department said that the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected people now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in focus.
At the diesel summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have swamp software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their re-equipment has been arranged by the KBA.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler told me to report to each of the parties concerned.
If an inspection is due at all, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the overall renovation be due?
"Sorry to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen, car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The refurbishment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would be imitating, says Smetanin.
Does a massive price decline of Euro-4 cars threaten?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come out of protest.
As the first rapper, LL Cool J (49) receives one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and television producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honours.
The awards will be given in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The winner, known with progressive TV series, Lear, therefore already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to remove them from the funds - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her viewpoint.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural facility in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, retires next year.
The body has already been selected - however, suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he conveys in the press talk.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest time possible.
Thus, while respecting the regular termination periods, there is still enough time to work in.
Since Haslach serves as a sub-construction authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit the relevant certificates.
Because this function wants to keep the city at all times.
If they were no longer able to complete these, the citizens would have to go to Openburg for advice.
But closeness is important to the city and its own, says Wacker, who reports about a good business environment and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have been gathered, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the Bauamt and his employees.
But in the future, many different projects are on the agenda: the reorganization of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofenparkplatz have been triggered.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and stadium cleaning is still the subject.
The latter alone will be beaten to book with about 1.5 million euros, "when we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successors.
The work here is fun."
Gestalterical is available for a large space for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, many things could be reacted quite flexiblely.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of green facilities is often praisefully mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monumental protection as an ensemble, it is important to have an eye on what fits in, when new buildings are approved, the departing city builder stresses.
Nevertheless, the city manager has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "at the end everything goes over my table."
For care and coordination he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job".
For continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to the City of Haslach, be able to present a completed degree as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor of Technology in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction regulations and planning law.
The City Building Office is under the responsibility of high and deep construction, construction management planning, land acquisitions, administration of urban estates, urban farm with building garden and urban gardens, as well as under construction law, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South track locked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the Leobener Road crossing (B116) on the lines.
They were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators come from two male offenders and have been searching for them since night hours.
Close to the crime scene, a pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a loudspeaker," said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch on the APA.
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement could also be brought to the offenders by rail customers.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be assumed.
The damages were repaired on Friday afternoon, the railways on the southern track could be managed without any obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains had expired on Friday morning, two of which concerned distance transport.
Freight trains did not fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study says exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealable state, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach convulsions and bladders, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to mitigate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments found that a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their inheritance.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have created a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammable intestine if the same system also works in humans.
The post-doctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mouses had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but separated, had not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal throbiomas of the mouse - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that usually live in the stomach-intestinal course.
The intestines of the mouse were sequencing DNA and six bacteria were found in the mouse with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mouse.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal chromium and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand the effects of the bacteria on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-producing cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a side product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our stomach-intestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophane by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, because these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "geny", believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfield player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the Holder Role, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira walked forward as preferred.
However, Matic had been excluded from the preparation Asian tour of the Blues and created only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted to have to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wished for another three new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments.
"Three of four to get, I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've done great efforts."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the US, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New impact for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD head, social-democratic Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no disruption from the party center, just no counterwind from the covenant - so was the most important desire of the voters.
Since Martin Schulz is leading the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-regulated capitals with increasing dismay.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep strikes.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green can't just rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising resignation of a Green Member has put the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition thus lost its majority of votes to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner has asked the abstinent Lower Saxony Greens MP Every Twesten to return their mandate.
The transgression to the CDU means a clear distortion of voter's will.
Each Twesten must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and Chief Electoral Officer of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not all be true," a SPD election fighter swings, when the new Job message reached the party center on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, President of the SPD of Lower Saxony, stands in the CDU after the rejection of the Green Members Elke Twesten.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD country associations.
And nobody knows what's next.
The Misere began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, that's all, calmed the comrades at that time.
After the countryside elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It became so - and it became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleide haut killed the party smoothly.
In the weeks thereafter, the compatriots resurrected tirelessly.
Then, when they had created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him the next hit came.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in the crisis communication after that.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW gas business and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
A lot of surveys were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just for that reason, because in recent weeks, more and more attempted to put an accent in the union.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden by comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted because they promised themselves to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
This is because the Dutch Greens are not guilty of the party's internal dispute.
And Schulz's not at all.
In the meantime, the comrades are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Your anger is focused on the Greens, and above all here on the abyssly parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerant and democraticly detrimental, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Left Party in the SPD Federal Group, the editorial network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the national list of the Dutch Greens, according to the Dutch Member.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Federal Group, complains of a "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The voter's will was clear four years ago: people have made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a leading candidate to the Federal Day election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He called for the background to be informed.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Appropriations for local core III
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back on what happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in Rehabilitation Area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the total funding.
In Rehabilitation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the up-to-date renovations are a "successful project" - it is finally important to promote internal development as well, not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe had received the information that there would be a Sanitation Area III.
The total funding amounted to EUR 833 333, which would amount to EUR 500 000 from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a rehabilitation area arise?
They will, as Schindler continues, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in rehabilitating whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could also be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal country programme "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object basis, i.e. per property.
The remedial area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The funding period will continue from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would only be carried out for the purpose of obtaining a questionnaire to be completed by the respondents in the remediation area.
In November or December, the statute decision will be taken as far as possible, so that the remediation can begin next year.
Pietschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said pre-examinations.
It is the question of assessing and deciding when and to what extent urban defects are being remedied.
A renovation note will then be entered in the land register for the property concerned.
Pietschmann will come to Empfingen again and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the participation of stakeholders was a major success factor for the project.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "built and land sheet", which includes the construction condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and apartment chart", details of the size, distribution and residents of a dwelling can be made.
The blue "operating arc" shall only be completed if the building operates business spaces.
However, it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funding works according to the "Windhund principle" - who comes first, broth first.
There is no way to "reserve" funding for later.
In conclusion, photos of the project "Local Center II" were shown to make the attendee a renovation "small".
British inventors set themselves a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory analyst at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the castles on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House costs the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production over the past month costs taxpayers up to 24,000 US dollars, according to the information of the military left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was issued next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin firefighter and a Mississippi forklifter.
The military office of the White House required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the evening before the event of his superior, the Deputy Navy Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6:00 and 9:00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the hours of service a second team would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground at the aircraft during the time.
The records provided by TIME did not clearly determine whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Looks like you're closed," the Deputy Commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president aircraft was performing taxi services in the context of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the president aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to stop the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
According to the US Ministry of Defense's hourly rates for the financial year 2017, however, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determining the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates of the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the staff costs but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is of course appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver seat of a firearm car.
In the White House Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives and jokeed with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before difficult task
Top rider of the Second Tennis League arrives at the table-driven Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss arrives tomorrow at 11:00 in Kiel at the table-driven Suchsdorfer SV.
In spite of five matches of still a fair balance, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has got the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Right on the back positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, above all imports from the high north.
"These Danes and Finns can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double", says Zay looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's gonna be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime January.
If the Frenchman who is still active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not get to the Bundesliga party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the Czech Liberec tournament will be the first to play this season.
The previously unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik Castillo was yesterday at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victorys last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the trainer team around Marius Zay fills up the frame.
How America Can Damage OMV
Donald Trump did not work really happy when he signed the law to tighten the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his hastening to enact the law," the Congress had packed in a few "constitutional rules", he said.
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US precedent.
After all, the draft proposes to punish European companies who help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
As a result, investors from the local OMV have been concerned and co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies.
The threat scene is huge.
However, it is too early for an impact assessment, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order.
Twelve guns are for his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be backed into the center of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobars killer reveals, the Netflix series is not over for a long time.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received its first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show.
In the third season, the DEA focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Headed by four powerful pates, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rap nitrogen) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With fixed contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban children's days.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head in the field of youth aid, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooked is still outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 children's days in the Krefeld area, in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past kita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables each, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for for 45 hours are eating in Kita at lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care when children stay until 2 p.m.."
46 part-time staff have kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food supplied, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the length of the hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the kita guidance."
Because it is also about: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team would be useful.
Also for the children.
"You have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen workers - will be done in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, the charm that it has shown as the most economical in comparison to the cost of the city's own government and foreign procurement, says the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are resettled.
"But these hours are not so much weighted for about 750 people in the educational area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Chief Executive Officer of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the Council elections in the provinces. Three women will be candidates for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to a electoral process that coincides with the transition from international battles to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over peacefully by a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered from a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
Hiking to the TV Jubilee
On the occasion of the 110-year-old existence, the TV Kaiseringen invites you to a small hike with coffee and cake.
The hike starts on Sunday, July 9, at 1 pm in Frohnstetten near the water reservoir in the Americastraße.
From there it goes back to the airport, to the Natter and over the forestyard back to the water reservoir.
The hike takes about one and a half hours.

Men trying to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who were with friends on the Kolpingstraße at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends.
One of the offenders then tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but that was not the case.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to make sure to managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie that they have a long-term commitment to production in their works in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross location.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits in addition to other products.
McVities' owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "earn first" if their activities were changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's asked "to express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being promoted".
GMB-Senior-Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affected by our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force is strongly focused on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantages.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence in McVitie."
A speaker from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies working in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our business processes change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave behind in her persecution of Neymar after she made an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Order Attack?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world’s highest-paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board is that the club has always done its best to take care of him since its arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the PSG president three years ago warned the football world about this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make one of our players sign with themselves, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller overcast and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately discarded a scooter placed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30, thus causing damage to the vehicle of over 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, ask for information.
For an accident at B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came up with him on his driving track, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the steering board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum traveled towards Leese on the B 215 at 1955.
In the area of the local passage of Stolzenau, a car came to him on his trail, so he had to go right.
The touran driver touched the guide board.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had vanished a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident injured, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter-payer vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report unloads Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses relies on Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," said, after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected an apology from the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be a great service to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own failures or their wrong assessment of the events at the time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized the two-dimensional measurement of violence in the Domspatzen.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is a "shaming and disgraceful act" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but it is noticeable that the "level of media manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," says Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian radio: "You like to go to the church and that's a food found."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beats were a very normal educational means" to "to get done with cheerful children, as I was one."
It would find it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.
Completely wrongly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memorial band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the Bistum Regensburg with the information?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be noted that Domkapellmeister R. has in many cases applied forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims found that they appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, despite violence, even connect positive memories to him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger finds it relaxing.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protected persons in the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist, who became handful of the more often when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you do the effort and read the whole 440 pages of report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly freed from any suspicion of co-deceivership in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excises of violence in the preschool also occurred outside its scope.
At any rate, one can blame him for having learned it too late or not taking the first statements seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "resolving", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent witness, describes him as "warmhearted", " popular", "honestly", "competent" and "competent", as an extremely kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "evereded by drips of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and high emotionality, which has led to an outbreak of anger.
That he was not only blowing with chairs and throwing the key bond on the ground, but also spreading ear-owned and too cheerful boys to the hair or ears, he admitted himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for it.
To his salvation of honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you also remember such discipline methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excès of violence in the preschool, this is, of course, a bagatell.
You are wondering if it is not more to do with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just crashed on him.
Many of those who have never understood him are still eager to work out on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in all respects!
In the media, a great deal has been reported on the topic of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also burdened by any involvement or fellowship in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapell Master.
Even the parents were not inaugurated.
"I've never dreamed of talking to my father or my mother about it," said one respondent to the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in the investigation of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even confide themselves to parents and sisters, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some way in a professional manner.
How do the Domspatzen students assess the role of Ratzinger in relation to the abuses?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student put it as follows: "In terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I also think it is really absurd to assume that just him ... bulls have opened more intrusive or clear or even more than their parents, internat leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "It was not possible to confirm that students and/or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance."
So as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any fellowship.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not having prevented or brought to the public.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name with these irreversible crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "waltexzen" to read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused in the "Wegschauen" report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mix of sexual abuse and excises of violence and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what the report is doing.
There is a clean distinction: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excise violence, and, we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report discusses incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible battle teaching, the cases in which boys were regularly chopped and maltrated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where scandalous conditions really had to be ruled.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On it was, as most witnesses stress, the theme "preschool" tabu.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What else was on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadist violence.
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "very many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in many cases, even connect positive memories with him despite violence".
So no more than the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could define only two periods in which the conditions in the preschool were reported to him.
The first time 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (if the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Has Georg Ratzinger consistently closed the ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In that he pointed out to them that "the battle penalty was continued to be applied in the preschool".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed when fighting sentences were forbidden in Bavaria too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, as everyone of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had been actually exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980 was the battle penalty officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trace of anachronism", that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the princess is right.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and not even to what was broken in the preschool of intrusions and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual at that time.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally going to work out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his rainsburger time did Georg Ratzinger give in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Was the issue of fighting punishment also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not at all hide that he was conducting a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true European cultural messengers and his musical tradition, from the Regensburg Domspatzen, which so far had been more nationally known, to turn around in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbons alone, you do not make big singers out of reluctant boys, and you do not have any success in any area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well, and I have experienced it again and again as wonderful, humorous, fondly friendly, deeply believers and heart-good people, of which one cannot imagine that he could hurt just a fly.
I regularly get with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emeritation, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict to them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a dear respectable person to whom they are still looking today and whom they really worship.
And, please, once again quite clearly, all that is blamed for him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad we've been over this time for a long time.
But it's highly unfair to make a man, just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media sin-bock.
There is only too obvious the evil intention behind it.
Because the report that has just been published makes it unloaded.
Now it would be advisable for a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would finally know the Regensburg Domspatzen.
