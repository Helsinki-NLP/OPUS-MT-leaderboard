Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 Harvesters infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and may no longer leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively on the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Landratamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the cause of the order test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - the cucumbers are only for insulation glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with more than 3300 inhabitants close to Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep peace: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of persons".
In the courtyard, infected persons were separated from non-infected staff, the site is now surrounded by a lock-out fence.
Greens and SPDs gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition groups rejected Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can bitterly revenge if such local infection events are excluded and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the Parliamentary Director of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "We have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvesters after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof Schlachthof in mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions on the workplace and the living conditions need to be carefully monitored from our point of view.
This apparently has not happened."
The outbreak came "with the commandment".

Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage of data
The stock data storage is currently exposed.
However, according to a media report, Federal Minister for the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of stock data - instead of the planned 10 weeks for a half year.
According to the "Image on Sunday", Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change of law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it would be useful to "do urgently necessary adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, stock data storage is suspended.
A decision of the Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, says the report.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would be useful to examine whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer had already voted for storage of data in June, together with the internal ministers of the countries.
NBA: Stripclubs for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitation in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles clippers, is expected to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the "Magic City" Strip Club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (an other strip club in Atlanta, Note d. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that the NBA Williams ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the seasonal final starting in the night on Friday.
Söder expresses itself after mass infection to Corona-Lage
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced on Sunday a tea plant for large farms.
The press conference will be available live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has scared authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working, more than one third of them have been infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked up with a building fence.
No one can leave the site, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the more than 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Land Council Office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Bisse of conscience": Confession of the alleged burner of Nantes
"My client has cooperated," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He very regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "plagued by conscience and very much taken from the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the Attorney General, the man is threatened by ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire was broken out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of fire.
The suspect now detained had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent entry into the church, he quickly entered the field of sight of the investigators.
To discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the European Commission creates complete facts," Grindel said the "image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can become most dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work at all: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, we do not go around the debate, whether it is not appropriate to facilitate the involvement of associations that want to break into this phalanx."
However, he doubted whether in the German Football League there was the willingness to allow majority participations prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There is still a legal risk of moving investment areas around the Bundesliga economic location in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB head sees the danger that "the attempts to achieve more competitive balance in the Bundesliga ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Sorry, there have been people who noticed this mistake and pushed through the press instead of speaking to me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very busy with this in humans."
The gift worth around 11.000 euros he had received from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparent and unduely.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never made "a hollow from the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"That can be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have been recurring through Donald Trump's use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday there were collisions between demonstrators and policemen in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, 16 in Seattle.
In Austin a person was killed by shooting while a demonstration train just crossed a crossroads.
Previously, during protests against racism and police violence, there had again been collisions in Portland.
The security forces, including federal police officials, set up tear gas on Saturday night and violently dismantled demonstrators.
Hundreds of, partly armed, demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death should be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot in March at a drug racing in her apartment in Louisville.
The goal of the Razzia was someone else who didn't live there at all, and no drugs were found either.
As a member of a group called himself an armed alliance of black Americans, on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were brought to the hospital.

A meeting of the two groups did not eventually come.
In the Texas Austin, a person was shot and died during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to their own information, the police held a suspect in custody.
She did not provide any further information on the circumstances of the act.
According to the New York Times, mayor Steve Adler said he was "discontented and disconcerted" about what had happened.
Even in the American metropolis of Seattle, demonstrators encountered the police on Saturday.
They fired construction cars in front of a youth prison, and the police put in blinking grenades and pepper spray.
According to the "Seattle Times", 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or body injury.
In the city of Oakland, California, a court building was fired.
A small group of demonstrators hit windows, shot fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, the Oakland police reported late Saturday evening (locating time).
The fire could be quickly removed again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd who demonstrated on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured to the hospital.
There were also windows in a court and a fire was laid, as the police told.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defiant Corona
Although the big sausage in the spa town was lacking, visitors and performers enjoyed the rockoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Although the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the human masses and programme heights burn like Saale, Rakoczy ball or arrest, many came at their expense from the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurdirector Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, you return to the beginnings of the rockoczy festival, as the historians alone were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has always been visiting with her husband for more than 25 years at the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made it comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watch the historians flanishing and listen to Cuban live music at the game bank restaurant.
"I also like it very much," says Konhäuser.
She misses the human masses that otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you lack the usual programme highlights, all of which Saale burns on Friday evening, as well as the historic fortress and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Tournament is scheduled to take place again
For the performers of the historical cures, the alternative programme was partly more work.
Approximately for Christina Gold, who participates in a normal year in the quarry and can be seen there on the cockpit of the garden café.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costumes.
"That's already harder, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The rider club had less to do, even if individual riders were on their way in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrilla will be held again next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 a Rakoczy tour should also take place again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish Second Litigist Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football bi-ligist CF Fuenlabrada is getting deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.

Time drive specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am setting out the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeines Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed in the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered to end his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiating with his team is also about the number of race days, he said.

Today I think as the father of a little daughter: What if."

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economics in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible but also unfair," it was stated in an opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around US dollars 66 billion (approximately EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is once again threatened by the state plague.
It would be the ninth failure to pay in the Argentine history.
Lastly, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to certain contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is holding on to its last offer and is not willing to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The latest inflation rate was more than 50 per cent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims of US$ 503 million, thus falling into a limited failure to pay.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It goes super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: mid May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will be the successor of Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notariat.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up the work, the normal daily business is long running on full tours.
"But I still have to come privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short time has not been sufficient to completely move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native dingolfinger.
Currently, she is with her husband, who works as a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband had been able to apply for parental leave in the short term to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to hang out from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also had a nightmare with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
The city of Eggenfelden has grown up in the neighbouring district, of course, for a long time.
When visiting on-site with her family in the past months, she recently found that "Eggenfelden is a pretty small town".
The more she was delighted that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
She also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: after the Jura study in Passau she completed her referendum period and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as notary, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg – at this time she also trained the doctorate in labour law – she became first notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went to parenthood, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services at various notariat offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden had been registered for the nearest retirement of Lutz Feller, it had seen the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has right away a praise for the firm team: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the future shift of the private food point.
She has already contacted a local institution in the area of kindergarten and crawling places.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to go through her hobby here soon too - and to meet the most beautiful yoghurts of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the season in the event of a fan return.
"As a result of the distance arrangement, which is required to comply, we are planning the day mirror with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer.
Normally, the arena in the district city takes a little more than 81,000 viewers at Bundesliga games.
In the last season’s spirit games caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB per party had lost about four million euros.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal audiences, some of the around 4,000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely broken away."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all are currently "good advice to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need is limited to entertainment," said Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB professionals for their pay-part-off, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their pay-off has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work."
Little miracles: early start into life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a packerl butter, just once three spoons of blood in his whole body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 early days, which is provided annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lung nor intestine nor muscle have been fully trained.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made for them mini-winds.
But not so small that they were not in voice - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger smunzelt.
"Although of course they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes stage
Despite Corona theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus gymnasium in Abdsgmünd shortly before the beginning of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theater of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "The Home Dress" - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange the play and performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
Born was the idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Even though at the end all parties agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional excitement, the theatre also sees the potential for contact with schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting supplement to the game operation," stressed director Winfried Tobias.
First round released: The TSV in 1860 would meet in the DFB-pokal at Eintracht Frankfurt
If the TSV qualifys for the DFB-pokal in 1860, the lions meet in the first round at Eintracht Frankfurt.
This was shown by the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-pokal are firm.
The lions would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was shown by the release on Sunday evening in the ARD-Sportschau.

Due to the voluntary resignation of FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Pokal (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If Secondliga-Aufsteiger Würzburg reached the final, sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to enforce themselves in the final game against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-pokal will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the third League start.
"From Winde hurts": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died in Paris on Sunday with 104 years of natural death, confirmed her spokesman of the German press agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South State Epos "From Winde" (1939).
As a child of British parents born in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a small child.
The Austrian theaterman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeares "Summer Night Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers took her under contract for seven years and brought her out large alongside Eroll Flynn.
Eight movies turned her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the main role of "To Every His Own".
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
A lot of recognition was also given to her as a neurotic excentrician in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Grave".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her to play the main role in filming her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The piece became a global success.
With her long-standing friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied for a body".
From the marriage with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953), the son of Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, De Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage, too, broke up.
However, rumors about a relationship with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Miss Thole/Wickler Finals at Comeback
The second World Cup Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, in the semi-final they submitted their National Team Collega Nils Ehlers and Lars Fliegen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Lastly, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final game at the Rhine, their Bezwingers Ehlers/Flights were defeating the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting points for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured their tickets.
Kalbitz release from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the viewpoint of the FDP only a "fig sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided by majority in May, on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial.
Kalbitz is President of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD really wanted to remove right extremists from their party consistently, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Likewise, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz remains excluded now does not say anything and does not change anything," he said the "world on Sunday".
"There are rather volumes, as many French supporters still have a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD."
The flower expects that the AfD will fall below five percent in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the now officially dissolved "flood" around the Thüringer AfD country and group president Björn Höcke; Constitutional protection inscribes the string as "protected right extremist ambition".
In May, the AfD Federal Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz did not indicate a previous membership in the now banned extreme right "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and with the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in HDJ.
The president of the Left Group in Brandenburg's Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten crees.
The AfD remains a right-wing extremist party, whether with or without Kalbitz."
This decision does not weaken the federal party nor the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen truppe is visible.
One wants to avoid further observation through constitutional protection and try to pass through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't let off the ghosts that she called.
An outcast does not change anything," commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the group held their right leader until today."
The legal dispute about Kalbitz membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now proceed in civil proceedings against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants in the German North Sea have injected electricity into the network.
That is more than 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth informed.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
Wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have consumed additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
In total, the wind flow from the North and Baltic Sea is 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest on the sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacity
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher production capacity, because new wind farms have been networked in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea all run at the same time with full power, they could produce 6,7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is 7,1 gigawatt according to Tennet.
By 2030 it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we invest EUR 20 billion in the development of offshore network connections," said Tim Meyerjürgens, CEO of Tennet.
In reality, wind farms can't exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea wind farms produced more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest for Corona cancelled
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital canceled the three-day party planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and hoped for the last minute, in a sense of how difficult it is for the parties involved," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partiless).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here."
For if tens of thousands had flown to the land and the tent, minimum intervals, hygiene rules and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the limitations would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk party.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by a number of times.
Rumberg comforted next year.
The city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence with the Winter Mountain Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Saxony Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressure Olympic winner Werth in Achleiden not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabel Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressur tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at four starts on the weekend.
After she won a Grand Prix for the opening with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also on Sunday at the Grand Prix Special and not to be beaten shortly.
At the 15-year-old Weihegold's stute, Werth held himself clearly against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
On Saturday, the Germans were also shortly on Quantaz before their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressur rider in the world is to establish the ten-year hunt in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first one at all.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four major exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More flight managers in Worms in the future
The Wormser University goes on to the fans: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" provides a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the University and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of the study not only during the summer but also for the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained.
At the same time, the capacity of both the university and the air navigation academy of the DFS is equally exploited.
The DFS will advise the university in setting up and occupying the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their flight management training at Worms University have been in the Air Traffic Management course.
This year, nine students started.
So far the experience of the DFS is very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, we do not find it economically easy to promote.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, President of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-safe investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, technically cross-border knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
This also emphasizes Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and economy.
With her, we would like to join the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's Course Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air navigation is for the University of Worm's motivation and commitment to further expand its teaching and research skills in the future fields of aviation.
With the first foundation professorship for a dual course, the University could put special highlights and innovative emphasises for its students in use for the flight managers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, stresses: "The University of Worms has a sole position in Rheinland-Pfalz, with its focus on air transport.
Today's signature of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully blocked on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in operation.
A 76-year-old drove straight with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau middle exit in the curve and landed on the guide board.
The impact triggered the frontair bags, the driver suffered mild facial injuries and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were provided by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital after the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about €2000, had to be dragged away.
Healing wants to review other sectors to the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought new light on the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Enhanced legislation is shortly ahead.
But are they right - and will it remain there?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the now planned strict rules against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for the industry when necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers already warn against generally restricting employment contracts.
After the massive outbreak of Corona at the Great Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to adopt a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use foreign persons in slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contracts and temporary workers is to be prohibited.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and workers' leave if you don't want to completely discourage the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their value added to the customer for a wide range of areas of craft, construction and plant construction.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil insured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company commissions an artisan to install a safety facility, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers the prohibition of labour contracts and leases in its own sector to be inconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why, in future, a different labour law should apply to the portion and packaging of cheese than to sausage, as reported by the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 per cent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European workers from industrial contracting companies worked in the industry, following the results of a NRW review, partly 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Salary has been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the housing of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law for the meat industry had already entered into force in 2017.
But they were circumvented by "trickful constructions".
"Now, basic cleansing needs to be done."
The politician announced: "The law on occupational safety, which we intend to adopt at the end of July in the Cabinet, is also a measure not only relating to the meat sector, for example, to higher levels of inspection in the field of occupational safety or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The present dpa draft includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and to the law on the protection of workers at work.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would wish that we could make even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg".
However, more controls would also require more staff.
Three dead when ultralight aircraft crashed in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed on a multifamily house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to the police.
A child would have been slightly injured.
Two more people had been saved in the accident, said a speaker of the Wesel Circle Leadership.
A parachute had been found at the accident site, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, calling for eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane was hit by a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
More details were not known at first.
Rooming of the Frankfurt Opera Square runs peacefully
A week after the excavations in Frankfurt, the rooming of the Opera Square on Sundays has also taken place peacefully.
Lastly, some dozen people stayed in the square, but left him before the beginning of the blocking hour at 1:00.
The police have been in operation since the early evening with numerous officials, a larger police order was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time, this weekend, from midnight, an entry ban was imposed on the Opera Square, on which it had come to Krawallen a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked out of the crowd of celebrators with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overlaps: Young woman in case of an accident at Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar severely injured
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered severe injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel hospital.
With heat cameras, the firefighter was looking for possible companions.
According to the police, the woman traveled on Federal Road 83 towards her place of residence Hümme, when her car left the tram from unexplained cause and crossed several times.
In order to save the accident, the firefighter had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was picked up by the rotating head with a heat camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, which also works with heat cameras, was also ordered for the search of persons.
However, the forces found no one between the high corn plants.
The severely injured person was brought to the Kasseler Hospital for further supply with the rescue car.
Almost 50 firefighters of Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescuing gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, the record championship Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who had not hit Sami Khedira, the most recently wounded ex-national player, is no longer able to push two games days before the end of the season of the A series from one place.
The second range of tables between Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half, despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
A play by Miralem Pjanic exploited the 35-year-old from the border of the criminal area directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved against the now more offensive guests on 2:0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dust down.
This ensured the glamourless but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, only Ronaldo, who was swept to the latte, should have done the right thing in view of the gate hunter value.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve-Coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Lastly, Juve was also due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo is still king of goalkeepers.
Because while the Portuguese superstar hit 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already 34 hits on his account, as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern at 5:1 (1:1) of the table-fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona.
The record in Italy holds the current juvenile professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015/2016 season, the Argentineian reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples.
In August, the "old lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title opportunity.
Juventus stands in the 8th final of the Champions League, but on 7 August against the Olympique Lyon has to compete a 0:1 playground in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite threats to punishment and court sentences, car drivers continue to gas in numerous illegal races on the bath-worttemberg streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the south-west have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparisons for the years before, but the lawns are increasingly working on the judicial authorities: in 2018, 155 investigation proceedings were conducted in the Public Prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, 252 in a year later and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races concerned less organized events, as indicated by the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request from the SPD.
In most cases the drivers were spontaneously opposed to each other or they would have taken the escape from the police - even this is indicated as illegal race.
At the tax was mainly German men aged between 18 and 60.
113 Penalties - 15 times detention
Only in relatively few cases are the lawns caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences have been imposed.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races actually rises.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequently, said a ministerial speaker.
Particularly popular is the highway 8. Always drivers brake traffic out there to provide space and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months before there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race"
On the A81 the police are even more racing than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit there is attempted to stop the lawns on the particularly affected section between narrows and geises.
The most high-priced and motivated sports and luxury cars often have Swiss marks because the drivers are avoiding to lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car race in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 hour kilometres, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD day group.
"The barrier threshold for lawns would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be here and there legally with 200 hourly kilometres and more."
From enlightenment or image campaigns, Rivoir thinks less: "Who in such a way goes beyond all rules and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly yet with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
This is not enough to the ADAC, on the other hand: "We assume that Raser will not be discouraged from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and more stringent controls on the routes concerned.
Not rarely, from the high-turning force fair, painful and follow-up seriousness becomes: Since January 2019 and until April 2020 three people died in the races across the country, two of them not involved in a night's crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were told to race a car.
One of the vehicles came out of the street, blazed against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured during the races of the last two years.
However, there is no need for stricter penalties, according to Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl: "Legislative action is needed in order to impose more severe sanctions on illegal motor races," says the paper of the Ministry of Interior.
Blue light of July 23: thirsty intruder steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A Witness heard noises on the valley road at 3.40 p.m. and ran towards the embassies.
There he noticed a man who served on the fridge with drinks and left the snack after he was hit by a front door.
The offender fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the intruder also used a cash deposit and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong statue.
In fact, he wore a black capuchon powder, black pants and bright shoes.
Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to win on the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprof Pascal Ackermann fought his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old puffer of the team Bora-hansgrohe went through on the 109-kilometre section with start and destination in Hermannstadt in the mass print after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the seasonal wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall assessment, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger continued.
On the morning, the 26-year-old had decided to run the mountain time for himself and thus took over the top in the classroom.
Only 104 drivers had arrived at the end stage in the evening.
Not less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit during the mountain season.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters ahead of the target he simply pulled his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the UCI World Association, a Corona test was carried out for all racers and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organisation team and from the media in isolated hygienic bubbles.
Lookers at start and target were not allowed.
Guide gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) was suddenly living in the water when bathing.
According to the fire force, the emergency call came shortly before 1 p.m.
"A lead station operator immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," said a fire speaker to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the revival measures shortly later.
The child at risk of life was transported to the Uniclinic during reanimation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely started the investigation for the accident.
The firefighter: "We're starting from a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meetings - Police takes in, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporary over 1000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night on the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police used their announcement to strengthen the control of such events.
A large Tuning meeting was held on Saturday evening (Jul 25, 2020) in Nuremberger Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police in Central France, at 22.30 p.m., the Nürnberger Verkehrspolizei observed an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a wide range of vehicle inspections.
Only recently had the police announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autopossibles.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "scene"
The officials were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police accounted for.
However, only a small part of the participants in the "Autoposer" and Tuningszene should be assigned.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene responded to the police appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it should be assumed that they were mainly spectators.
In addition, the majority of attendees remained in the current anti-infectious provisions, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the wear of a mouth-nase protection.
The on-site control measures were completed at 1:00 p.m.
In total, officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car race
Illegal car races didn't exist.
"The police office in Central France will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out reinforced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of spectators," he said.
The agency News5 talked to Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved drag-off company: "They have all beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this purpose.
Even because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to make any damage.
"Young people should finally keep their cars without prejudice."
Numbers of the Agency: 900 suspicious cases of short-term abuse
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) has stated that around 900 suspect cases of abuse of short-term worker money are being investigated.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, CEO responsible for the operational business, "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, very many companies suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more detailed we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more to do.
We are not naïve there and have a long breath."
Any indication of abuse would often be made by the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to detect misuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA prepares for a potential insolvency cell in autumn.
"Shall there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The estimates are disparate, but in the case of the case, we are already training our employees in the work agencies for the processing of insolvency claims."
The numbers are still unremarkable, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection had been dissolved at 20.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the Foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park then.
On Saturday night, some young people would have played in the new garden of Rugby.
The meadow had been cleared by district riders, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation there are repeated collections where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 transitional regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there had been a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, and a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona regulation, the parks will be closed when the darkness breaks.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to parking order, there are only a few exceptions.
For a long time, the Foundation has complained that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, at night at Sunday, 5000 people celebrated an illegal tech party.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Massentests after Corona outbreak in tourist location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austria tourist village of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young interns are in tourist businesses, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Inhabitants, guests and tourist workers were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The blocking time was set at 23:00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also, individual guests have traveled in advance.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Oberösterreich, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become publicly known.
On Saturday, the head of the District Authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the interns who had celebrated in several premises and could have infected themselves there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he said to the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the risks of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak raises memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tirol, which during the early stage of the pandemic was a centre of Corona spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football recorder Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League's game, the Red Devils secured the third table slot with a 2:0 (0:0) - success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be satisfied with the Europa League because the FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as the fourth for the royal class.
In the fight against the deceased, Aston Villa was allowed to celebrate.
Manchester United was led by a offense by Bruno Fernandes (71. minute).
After a red map for Leicester City in the post-play time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) met at the end.
Chelsea, in the Champions-League final opponent of FC Bayern, won parallel to 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"This means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who also stands at the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea-Coach.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Tottenham also benefited from the hotspur, which with a thin 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace passed by the Wolves and started as the sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the Fernduell with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for itself, but at West Ham United had to tremble for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84) was like Andrej Jarmolenko (85).
The 1:1 (0:0), however, was sufficient because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which played three coaches during the season, descends after five first-liga years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end, a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been held as an English champion since the end of June, secured an association record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds ever achieved in a football season.
The score record in the English football, Coach Jürgen Klopp with his team was scarce.
The Bestmarke holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38), Divock Origi (59) and Sadio Mané (89) played the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütze van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be difficult."
Satisfaction is likely to be the Premier League boss at the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, the football company in England had been interrupted from March 13th to June 17th.
In the meantime, even a premature breakout or an extension of the remaining games was discussed on a neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Head of Government Netanyahus are becoming more and more violent.
In the night there were violent conflicts.
The Israeli police acted violently at the night of Sunday in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against the Right Conservative Head of Government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participation in unrests, police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld informed.
Among other things, the police used water throws to dissolve the announcement.
A total of around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahus office on Saturday evening, according to media reports.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahus dealing with the Corona crisis.
The Protestants beat drums, blew in horns and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu had also been arrested, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested according to police information near Tel Aviv because it is suspected that he had sprayed pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrant had been slightly wounded at the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
Lastly, Netanyahu was also criticized for handling the Corona crisis.
He is given the opportunity, among other things, to speedy relaxation and lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has been difficult for the economy of the country.
The unemployment rate was last more than 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with the corona virus in Israel last increased to ever new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter power on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - On Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen, an accident called for nine slightly injured persons.
A driver and her two children (3.5) travelled towards Beckum.
The police: "Surely she had stopped suddenly because she wanted to turn away."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who was driving behind her must have seen that too late.
He pushed back on the car on it.
During the accident, three inmates were slightly injured in the car and six in the transporter.
Several rescue cars brought them to an surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks border town after Corona suspected
To date, North Korea has seen a "lightening success" in its own anti-coronavirus measures.
Now, for the first time, the country reports on a suspect.
Due to a first official suspicion of Corona in the country, North Korea has completely sealed a big city because of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defensive measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been brought into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong the emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership called the highest level of alarm.
If the suspicious case confirms itself, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the demolitioned country.
According to its own data, North Korea had not registered any infection and described its defence measures as "lightening success".
The data were questioned abroad.
According to reports, the symptoms were detected by a "extinguisher" who had illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation for cross-border military buffer zone within the four kilometres wide and largely deformed from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports of the National News Agency Yonhap, South Korea's military admitted the possibility of illegal crossing of borders to North Korea as high.
There were investigations on some persons.
According to its own information, on Saturday, for the suspicious event, North Korea called an urgent meeting of the political office of the Worker Party chaired by the leader Kim Jong Un.
"The dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster."
Kim already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and region from others", said he.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contacted him had been put under quarantine.
The party's central military commission should therefore investigate the "extinguishment" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe penalties.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still before a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committees will also vote on the construction plan for the major city development project East," it is more occasional in the middle of the urban press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28th, at 4.30 p.m. in the CongressCentrums Pforzheim's Grand Room.
In particular, the upgrading of the Eastern City is nevertheless discussed controversially until the end of the debate.
The majority of them are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence.
A call from the economy (built, real estate, trade and IT), the project that was developed out of citizenship and then by the administration and municipal council, not to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project adversary Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "disregardless", " speculation", "emergency" and "conscious fake speeches".
"All think it's better to know," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List for a year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit becomes cheaper for the city to say that the Technical Town Hall is, contrary to the statements of the city administration, after grants, whose existence Klein is convinced to repair for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the town hall and on the part of the economic supporters.
The City by its own power and not an investor: This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-thales for administrative areas and a smaller part of the city centre conversion, ideally with local supporters.
Environmental issues play a key role
In addition, environmental issues will play a key role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road transport, including often temporary deductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of pace 30. The political leaders in the city are not innocent of having to do so because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus of noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Pforzheim/Enzkreis Energy and Climate Protection Agency.
In addition, the agenda for accession to the climate change pact of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban child-age facilities and the application for inclusion in the state's smart-city support.
Citizens are welcome, but they must take Corona protection measures.
With much delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year's delay Tim Zimmermann starts on July 31st in his first season at ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of supersport cars can take on the regular operation, the first test trips were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old longenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitz ring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are some things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"For example, with the ABS you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Roomman also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car at the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutch has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves blurringly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - on the Lausitz ring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
As of July 31, the 33 supersport cars will be racing through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of the 15 new series, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had little to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitz ring has many quick passages that you have to meet optimally to be quick."
How fast Zimmermann is then really, that will emerge in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little at the tests," he says.
"But finally, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend on the Lausitz ring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the beginning of a tightly pushed calendar.
Seven races are on by the beginning of November.
The current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will grab the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantine Decision Cold
According to press reports, the British Government's decision to put Spain leavers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has coldly caught the country's Minister for Transport.
Thus Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona figures in Spain, the London Cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to go to quarantine after their return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are only on the day of holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is, by the way, considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine in Austria is needed.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is the possibility of a quarantine for vacationers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has tried to tell Grant Shapps."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict exit block, the infection numbers in the country are rising again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the UK's favorite holiday countries.
From unnecessarily traveling to the Spanish mainland, the British government is currently advising, the particularly popular Canaries and Balearic Islands for British holidaymakers are excluded.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 dead have been reported in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersound weapons for warships
The Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that on the day of the Navy in his country, the warships were equipped with the most modern hypersound weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the battle opportunities of the Russian marine forces would be extended, said Putin on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central Marine Parade.
According to Interfax, the Department of Defence also informed the Agency of successful tests of the hypersonic rocket zircon built for the marine.
The hypersound weapons have a multiple noise speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered to be the weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo continues to be built
The submarine torpedo Poseidon was also built on atomaryly fenced torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea roast is intended to destroy coastal targets.
The President, who also drove with a military boat, said that only this year 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country of the earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy protected Russia reliably, said Putin on the day celebrated by Matrosen across the country.
On many other Russian coastsides, the marine forces also started the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia fights on the side of power of Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapon show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There was also ammunition fired.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defence, there were not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help for Corona difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfalls now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Centre informed the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called the emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic in Texas complicates the work of the helpers, said Abbott, according to US media.
Evacuated call for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, "Houston Chronicle".
In view of the spine storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and becomes even worse when you remember that it flows through an area that is the most affected area of the state of Covid-19".
According to Johns Hopkins University, as a result of the Corona pandemic, about 5,000 people have died alone in Texas.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes with caution.
They should not disregard the practices that we have used to, such as wearing masks, said the Governor, according to the CBS broadcaster.
It is important that all the distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms had also been provided in some places.
Corona should also be tested in emergency accommodations.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Resumption of storm warning
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was reported to have been hit on land on the island of Padre Island right in front of the texan coast.
The tropic storm had previously been raised to the lowest stage of the hurricane.
For the coast section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and later revoked.
The authorities expected a decline while "Hanna" continued to move into the countryside and to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, the Hurricane "Douglas" was traveling on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour towards Hawaii.
The Hurricane Centre, however, expected its further weakening.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the Hurricane threshold.
This year, after a May forecast, NOAA expected an over-average active hurricane season over the Atlantic.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected to become up to six very strong storms, the Authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes over the Atlantic every year, three of them becoming storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which is even less than a ten percent, it was said at that time.
US President Donald Trump wrote by Twitter that his government closely observes the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four gates butknowledged: Video assistant " punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were immediately re-knowled two gates
Naples - four gates achieved, four gates yet known: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rabies night at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian Football League series A - and was quite angry with the video assistant of the referendum.
"A festival of not given gates for Sassuolo.
Never has the VAR done so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had gone through a gate by external defenders Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32rd minute Filip Djuricic first praised the compensation.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) returned the hit because of a remote position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball again into the network - again the VAR attacked.
The gates of the attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) also withdrawd the arbitration team, as indicated by the VAR.
In the post-play time Allan made the 2:0 end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar fall on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology ensures record," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a reluctance for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to consider how he can reconstruct his successful defense after the wound of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of operation behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Head of Middle Field Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury on the left root and threatened to fail in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich's Schmuddelwetter, the law defender broke off a training game and was driven off with a golf card.
How long the full-bodied tribal player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A play in the 8th final back game against FC Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament that starts in Lisbon on August 12.
The Bavarians do not want to stop from training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wanted to see from his stars on his way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his victory-hunger title collectors in the 28 days following, ideally, until the Royal Class Finals on August 23.
"We have just mastered the duties with championship and pokal.
Now it is important to create the special one," Flick said.
Until the Munich final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eighth final spot against the FC Chelsea stands for the first time.
After 3:0 in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not again become Bavarian old age, like in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and tank confidence with a good game," Flick claimed.
A vote test will be held against the Olympique Marseille on Friday.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had leave after the Double 13 days, to a unique August.
31 players he welcomed on the Sabener Straße, including the new players around the Edel-Shop Leroy Sané, who first met all the new colleagues in the square after he moved from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put himself in well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to participate in training, Flick much more talked about the current title project of the German series championship.
After days of single and small group training, team strength is now trained for Londoners who are in the game rhythm, unlike Flick-Ensemble.
Afterwards, a quarter final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi could be in front of the Münchners; in the semifinal, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy," the chef coach stressed, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup recorder Klose and Flick know about a number of joint tournament preparations, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 mood.
With his current team the work was "a pleasure", praised Flick.
The "focussity on winning" is an impressive attraction of his team.
At the tournament with nine teams on Sunday, it was also ambitious.
Of the service providers, all were involved, including the emigrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not secured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to cure its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
However, all the American races were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three race routes were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring is scheduled to be driven in Germany and Portimão in Portugal.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought on the Italian tradition course in Imola for World Cup points.
The 2020 race calendar includes 13 runs according to current status.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our 2020 season plans," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motorsports are to be completed in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
In front of the races already officially scheduled in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports showcases in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November.
Rules requires race on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there is a world champion.
Under a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles under reference to "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional seasonal start in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the emerging Corona crisis.
Returning to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Refusal in Brazil Criticity
Due to the tense situation in Corona, the races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being back with them in the next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the American races was critical in Brazil in particular: "The rejection came not surprisingly for us, but the reasons we cannot accept," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams not to want to drive in Brazil would not justify rejection.
We should be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's well-known Latenight show by video clip and told her what she had in mind at her meeting with Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was guest in a popular US-Latenight show by video clip.
She told about her fight against the mighty of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "male look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the last two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg drew attention to himself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known latenight show, she spoke about her plans in the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Letight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's mighty ones.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to get the focus away from the climate crisis," she shocked.
"Everything from organized hatred campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes on the street," she has experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who spot them in social media or even try to silence them find them "lukkig" because they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to them".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the UN climate summit in New York in 2019, for which the actress sailed over the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, which is an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at this moment?
She only briefly answered the relatively open question by Stephen Colbert: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
With the beating-ready answer, the experienced satirian Colbert had probably not counted and disappeared smilingly from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race around Europe's Golden Shoe with Bayerns Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has the best chance to become a goalkeeper in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-Profis received three hits in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, two of which converted eleven meters into the after-play times of both halfs.
Thus, the 30-year-old of the table fourth season has now 34 seasonal goals on his account - as many Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich achieved during the Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 gates so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rear track ride: after a fast climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steep down and then slowly back up.
Now the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: The co-founder of the Fleetwood Mac band, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73 years, on Saturday family members informed in an official opinion that a further opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-standing legendary band in 1967 in London, and until today, his dreamed instrumental hit is "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") was like an acronym.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes but then without him.
It is said that there was a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for beneficial purposes.
He began to appear in large garments and with great crucifix.
Psychiatric problems should also have played a role.
==References====External links==*Official website
It followed a social downturn.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographs reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the image.
He should have lived on the streets, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in a Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
In the early years he was enthusiastic for US blue musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and had five years later the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly later he was hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues tree, Green founded Fleetwood Mac and his Bluesbreakers colleges Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the summer of 1967.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadow sides: Green did not support the media room, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and addiction later he commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best was to land a number 1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 won surprisingly a success of respect with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac now swims on a success wave without him in new formation.
Its album "Rumours" published in 1977 sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not succeed in a larger comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of friends of musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" at that time spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
Green released some albums free of drugs with the Peter Green Spinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend at life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in recent decades.
