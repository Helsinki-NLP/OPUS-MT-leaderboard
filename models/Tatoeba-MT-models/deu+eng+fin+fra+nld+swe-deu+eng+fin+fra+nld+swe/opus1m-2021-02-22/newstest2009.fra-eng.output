At the end of the exchanges, the Prague scholarship fell in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague scholarship received its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reach almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague scholarship began with its fall from the day before, when it lost almost six per cent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
The market response to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives of the United States, who refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is thus also visible in our homes.
Outbreak of actions in Asia
Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indices succeeded in removing some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four per cent during trade, but later it wiped some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, following the Chinese stock movement of Hong Kong Stock Exchange, lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five per cent, but eventually losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6%.
"The hesitation about the US rescue action will affect the world's financial markets," observed Joseph Yam, Head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it would be likely that other countries would have the impact.
The blood bath of American actions
On Monday, the House of Representatives of the United States rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (around 12 bilions of Kč).
The legislators thus denied the call for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The American actions experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main signs of action were the biggest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly 7 per cent, with such a decline for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free decline.
Congress Ceda: the U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The heads of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid of $700 billion (approximately SEK 12 billion) granted to the US financial system.
Success is, however, not certain.
Before the final version of the Act is published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the President of the House's Bank and Financial Regulation Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should first be put to the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revitalize financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, a "disappointment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on the form that the market stabilization package should have," the Bloomberg Agency told the Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
She said that the final vote could take place on Sunday.
During the night of Saturday to Sunday, legislators met with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should redeem from financial corporations invendable real estate assets that lead financial corporations to considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the market for stock that falls.
According to the democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are making the Congress reach a final agreement from Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could affect trade on Monday.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations are not likely to be blocked at the last moment by any problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there will be many changes to the law.
The total amount for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount by following two steps: first, an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush commended the progress in the negotiations
Although the President can put his veto on this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to put it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted in obtaining finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value was declining, was maintained because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The President of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the agreement of deductions, the performance of the plan on the time axe.
The new Act also provides for limiting the golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides support for real estate owners who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the monthlyities of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A Psychological Help
According to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets in difficulty will be.
This will be crucial for sharing losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, Marek says it is not that important.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree, from this week on, that they support this plan and that they devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," highlighted Marek.
An extreme struggle: MP3 readers against mobiles.
We'll advise you how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Notwithstanding that there are sufficient reasons for obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-quality expensive grammar to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
However, if there are vinyl discs in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you will probably dream of such a grammar.
It is the same as music during travels, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one thing, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would have been hard to support listeners purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
There are two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of batteries is also decisive
Some high-quality music readers are able to do much more than just play music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and SMS, it is able to read music and movies, to record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Given that no refrigerator can grill meat and no television takes photographs, we are witnessing almost a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The greater the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two recharges will be.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energies.
It is rare for mobiles who are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (particularly the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you may call from time to time, get, to be over, a second reload for work - this is even valid for more expensive devices.
There will be no problem for MP3 drives that are capable, following recharge, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers can take it without reduction, given the small dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
With regard to the readers, you do not need any software, except for the exception (iPod).
Just fill the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then according to the user's judgement.
Some devices display only one index with a tree structure, in the way of Windows Explore, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, focus on the life of the accumulator, memory capacity, sound quality and type of output, and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and in the day you will only listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you will have enough any mobile reading MP3.
Practically all mobiles are able to do so today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
Everyone can read the MP3 and the vast majority of music that will reach you will just have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-quality mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the corresponding websites of the operator (or any other supplier) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for obtaining a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of operators is poor and, in most cases, it is limited to fast-made radio tubes.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either by GSM, Internet, or even by wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still wear their motive on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use integrated drives, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 drives.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, we can already have a very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of regular listeners exit.
The price of the best phones and the best utilized, also equipped with a regular listener entry, does not exceed 15 thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
In fact, anyone can order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command to that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a grammophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by an enormous data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you are not going to exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models in principle support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even get out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialised walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the control ease is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went farther in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is provided by a MP3 player produced by one of the above brands.
A first virtual operator will win Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already repeatedly mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (the Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in our homes than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some of the Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo.k, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office Council (ČTÚ), who repeatedly stated that there was no room for another operator in Czech Republic, choiring with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network is apparently no longer having much chance (by the way, now he would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable price reduction, which then had to respond to by-products by conventional operators.
However, even before the party disorders such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile came into the market, voices similar to those heard today in our homes were allowed to be heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual Mobilking operator.
In only six months, this operator has succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and has become the fifth operator in the country.
Let us add that behind Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which, among other things, has the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be effective, they need much less customers than a conventional operator.
They are exempt from the costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network, which are relatively high.
This is how virtual operators around the world profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Britain at least twice the cost of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, bet on an unusual target group can also be a good blow to advertising.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could also work in our homes.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
More particularly, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, says mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project with success, but in Czech Republic negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said in a phone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman of the financial group Penta.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were not in any case in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business client sector, has not, for a long time, concealed its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile services.
And the sooner it will be the best.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of us, we managed to make progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl's spokesman.
The future is therefore perhaps promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by complete silence.
"We do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific markets.
For the moment, no subjects with a complex and serious project in this area have contacted us," mentioned Vlastimil Srše.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's spokesman said in a rare agreement with the O2 statement, "We have not currently registered a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate within such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone focuses on the fulfilment of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe is the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to lower prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So what is the benefit of facilitating the arrival of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to be heard at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The most apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, during the creation of the U:fon, was the pressure exercised by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidence of information available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon is ready to use as an argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "In addition, competition in the mobile market has recently been reinforced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it to high demands, especially its services."
However, given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted its typical position in the face of this problem.
"A virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not initially shown sufficient interest for conventional operators," explained in response to our question Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of ÚOHS.
A statement thus made would not be surprising by representatives of operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than disgusting.
In particular, as Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be noted that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the direction of a fair functioning of the market and price reduction is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concordance of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, whether this really is a chance, arises naturally.
Similarly, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and hard competition.
"The Office has not found signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," explained Chaloupa's statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many discord points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts are proposing a different view of things: in order to enable the creation of a virtual operator, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has logically the monopoly on his network.
This is why he must play a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting in a similar way.
However, complaints by many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Responding to the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, by which the ÚOHS washs its hands.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in moving into the innovation of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work
In other words, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operator, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unseen.
These are companies publishing their own price list of mobile telephone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, there are companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile phone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies are generally only available to elected companies.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company made before the operator belongs to a classic company client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she receives special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are referring to happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could lead to an interruption of collaboration with the society in question," answered our question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is fairly unlikely that a echo of such activity would not have been achieved to the managers of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, an operator does not pronounce itself against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them unforgettable profits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
This is exactly what should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises to the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to content itself with the explanations of the operators, who claim that they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decrease in service prices.
However, in practically all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were sometimes more, sometimes less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in developed countries, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they finally obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is dismantled by sending it to a close target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable for them in these cases.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the stab.
If the sliding information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly remain impassible to the rejection (discriminating) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national hymn.
Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national hymn Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was recorded again by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji★ Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Knřnková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremi★ and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose to interpret solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"Since the beginning, I was trying to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that the words were well understood, which they sang simultaneously," he explained.
The Czech national hymn will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
For the first time in 1834, the song Kde domov můj held on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously adapted it.
After the creation of the Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national hymn.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How to sound the "new" hymn
Pragian public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticket system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will climb in the metro, trams and buses, which instead of having a paper ticket will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible for about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon for 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both register it on their chip card at the information points and offices of Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádra. Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons via the Internet on the website of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the gateways in the metro stations, where they had to pedestrian in long queues so far to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon via the Internet and they will record it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"On these points of contact, there is a access point with trained staff available to passengers, which will help interested parties purchase online and, moreover, will record the coupon they bought on their map," said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can also be recorded on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the machines to composter tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská Metro Stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
An automate will control the coupon instead of the driver
Machines that will operate from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register on the card itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
In the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the central Bohemian municipalities mainly use to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the timetables for public transport in Prague.
Perurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's car.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Open Card at the location on the side of the car.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"In the event that the passenger would have to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires, may return to the automatic distributors, originally used to record the coupons on the card.
This is where, on the screen of the device, the information about the validity of their document will appear.
Sudes called for a referendum in the United States
The Germans of the South asked in 1945 that Šumava be integrated in the United States.
This results from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of South Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This follows, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov prayed in the letter to the President of the United States not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and we want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come into the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, "Persons, to whom the fate of the Šumava holds the heart".
Given that the connection with Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, unreasonable attitude, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take into his hands the protectionorate of the Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign State, which oppresses and destroys minorities, and which in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter million inhabitants," says the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for vengeance of the Czech oppressors.
If the President of the United States doubted the views of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronate of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the South of the time.
While at least the Czech Germans had to understand that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them had such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to obtain some kind of autonomy for the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, it was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the marine in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region's catch camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
In his view, none of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought that, following the Beneš decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
Action towards the most costly road safety in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The Office of Minister Aleš .eb.ek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign cost 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol driving.
But also remind them of taking the belt before starting.
It wants to touch the awareness of young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is entered in major sections on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood flake, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that life can be paid for a moment of ignorance.
The spots will "manage" the spectators until 2010.
The Department has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He considered that this would lead to a decrease in the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The Sugar and Pipe Strategy against Drivers
"What works with the drivers is the sugar and whistle system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by gaining time when they grill a red light.
The whisper is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Risks must be reminded of drivers," said Martin Ko.n, the Na Homolce Hospital Transport Psychologist.
This is how we need press information campaigns and especially negative advertising, says the psychologist.
In his view, the signs that signal the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static sign that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Ko.n said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli provisional government, spoke in favour of the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the territories (occupied), or even all," says Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without that peace will not happen," he added.
He admits that the possible refund would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to break his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, must give up parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of injured people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed later.
Retreat from Golan's heights
Olmert also pronounced himself in favour of the retreat of Israel at the heights of the Golan, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retirement," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (movement Shit); they will have to renounce their constant support for Hamas (movement Shit) terrorism, Al-Kaida (terrorism network), as well as that of Djihad (holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Stewards in the car are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is prohibited
In the context of the tragic car accident of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel inside the bus during the journey.
"If the law was strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward was contrary to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanzelka's spokesman.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck crossing the road of the car.
The girl was at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the car can have an accident, or even slow down suddenly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What is important is whether the car is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing or not seats.
If this stand-up equipment is not approved, passengers must remain sitting.
The long-distance Student Agency cars do not have standing places; which was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is a question that we have dealt with with with the department and, at first, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we obtained that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - there is no legal requirement to deal with that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds ambiguity to the speaker Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department, considers that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"Everything depends on the fact that the car has permission to offer standing spaces in its approval.
Everything is in it," he says.
The buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing seats and a higher permissible speed and in standing long distances with the highest permissible maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho.n, expert at BESIP (road safety) in safety in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic there is no danger. The situation can be compared with that of the service in the aircraft.
There too, he is not sure when a turbulence occurs and the hostess of the air can hit his head."
"But in the event that the car would have had a sudden brake, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal requirements," he said, "and also believes that from the legal point of view, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only car carrier to offer stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession to be a risky profession.
"No less, as soon as I feel it's a risky job, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason for the absence of stewards in his vehicles is the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine, who ensures, compared with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have a hostess. We have opposed it since the beginning.
Earlier or later it will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, in Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived
A young hostess of the Plze★ region, who has been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the line of Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flash and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid him by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he fryed him by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgement of the court, but with regard to the financial compensation, it also counts on the guilty person.
An amendment to the law?
Not in view
An amendment to the Act, which has been drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movements of stewards on board the car.
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone on the wheel," said Ho.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be a fundamental threat to passenger safety," concluded spokesperson Hanzelka, stating that car safety control is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfians rest on Frankfurt.
The main words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of entities of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could form itself, according to the post published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
As a whole, such a relationship could be the decisive move to other concentrations in the Länder' banks sector.
This is what it looks like when a management committee wants to demonstrate its capacity to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under high pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority which, just recently, made it clear to the Government of the North Rhine Land of Westphalia that time was counted in seeking a future solution.
However, for some time - also on the Frankfurt side - a relationship of any form between the Deka Bank, which knows the Sparkasse's clients through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas informed when presenting the figures for the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each of which is supported by the Länder Banks and the Spare Funds Groups, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debt of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, talks have just begun, it is said in the financial position.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial place, which is about the consolidation of the savings funds sector.
In 2003 it was believed that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land of Rhine Palatinat and the Halbab bank.
But nothing came out of this terrary bouquet.
Hardly the plans had been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse pronounced itself against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Later, neither did the other two houses join.
The bank of the Land of Rhenia Palatinat was attached to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new tracts on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had voted against any merger business strategy with its bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling appears to be that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the elections to the Parliament of Bavaria have taken place, a union of BayernLB with the Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg could become the first one.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers was to increase, the potential partners gradually escaped.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers grouping, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, on the other hand, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
It would remain at the rigorous of NordLB.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, which commercial model should ensure the future capacity of the Länder' banks, had not yet been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfers.
In the end, a deportation of the WestLb could take place, deportation which is obviously not desired here.
This is also mentioned in the letter of the Executive Committee in place: in any case, a 'global resolution' would be addressed for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is accompanying her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre tonne of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built barb that shows about 200 visitors to the beer party which its deep sounds can produce.
Elena tapes Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva train station, four buses take the departure tonight at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', scheduled for arrival at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing from gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loud, Marco Guarda explains, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long coat doubled with false fur and glasses with large silver mounts.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three out of this year alone.
They go overnight, stay the day at the party, and come home at 22:30.
Tonight there would be unnecessary costs," Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, breezed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and a German speaking group manager - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses roll in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travellers sleep.
It's better so, they'll still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian registration plates will take a break a little before Munich, on motorway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at 6:30 as planned on parking near the Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: hair off the little yellow cap.
Dessus is written on the left `Feast of the Beer' in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco `conoscerviaggiando.it' travel agency.
Second: "When the doors of the beer chapiteau open, we run," Marco shouts in the morning.
Run! Run, and reserve the places at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise you block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, they must be distributed in the room!"
The chope, screaming Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the direction!
`Show to the security officers that we do well!
As soon as you leave your places, they are gone!'
Thirdly: 'This evening, being back here at 10 hours and a half pile!' Understand?
And that's it, it's going to the beer party.
On the way, someone hooks yellow heads to trees to find the road, panels and even an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer party, known as the 'Italians' weekend.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 people going through the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 per cent of visitors would be expeditious from Italy this weekend.
The police are reinforced by seven police officers in South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces statistics on countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for the Shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word `relatively' and that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This is what happened this weekend.
The financing of the Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, receives a one-billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulences.
One person in confidence said to Reuters on Monday that aid appropriations were granted up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter company bears the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state finance had been reinforcing in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which was no longer possible since the lack of market confidence.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to €2.7 million, and the equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current profits and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period in the previous year, at zero, the profits from the allocation of certain claims and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen from more than EUR 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And only thanks to the significant profits from the repayment of downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Group companies, has the profit deficit of approximately 16 per cent proved to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state finance had first failed to speculate on real estate loans, which had subsequently been branched to the Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state funding was not sufficiently profitable, the Depfa had then intensified its commitment to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
With regard to the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must make amortisations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's profits and losses, which still remains quite vague.
The fact is that dividends have been shot.
Already in 2007, they had been trunk to two thirds.
Since the purchase of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state investor and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the inter-bank market as it does not own any deposits of customers.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks has again been considerably tari, with banks accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - about EUR 50 billion - of all Depfa appropriations of a short-term refinancing medium.
According to a communication from the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets that are largely out of business at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, the Chairman of HRE Georg Funke's Board of Directors explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to use financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are based on the principle that the Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now insured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have only to hope.
However, given the dynamic and imbalanceability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used as a whole.
But the opposite cannot be removed either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still at the doors of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for at least provisional will not succeed in reassureing the spirits either.
The stock price fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the rates of bonds are particularly good.
While first-class debts have barely moved, second-level loans are decreasing.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and those, of course, who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed previously to be an alternative speculation investment, and their value must now be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the establishment through the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as the emission institutes, governments and trade banks are still less affected are willing to support the system, it can be assumed that the withdrawals are absorbed over time.
Or will happen what no one is afraid to expect at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia primarily for long-term creditors when deciding whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a trait to defer losses for the next few years to the next capital income tax on the automatically collected stock exchange gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to be present for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Log of Exchange, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
I was so excited.
Already the way to go to school scared me.
I live in the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't lose myself.
The start of the courses does not seem to be as strict as in our Lower Saxony.
Students appear each other from eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course starts, it was my job to introduce me.
I am not like talking in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old dress from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue high socks and black leather shoes.
So in this dress, I presented myself in front of the pupitre, and I tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class all made low fairs, made laughs and made signs, and I have consistently heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "good, sweet".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a great ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone talked to who better, had a lot of laughing and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand the English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My welcome mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable German case.
I had aromatic herb rice, small sausages, a concombre salad and algae, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a strange look and a completely new taste.
What's safe is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salted prunes confited, brrr!
The Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then especially carefully prepared - in the hope of being able to make a little better acquaintance with the boy during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could observe it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year in school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
In the end, reading mangas is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture found there, at some point, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weak for traditions, habits and customs.
And here we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a cafard fleeing from the danger, does that mean he also feel fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that he feels the same thing when he is acting in the same way as we?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think to be true without having the evidence of it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without that I or anyone else have so far been able to prove it just as it is not possible to prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains will have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and deal with the issues of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter hardly practical terrains because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is facing a danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he dies, flees or attacks.
Human beings are acting in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce from a comparable subjective life.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our lives subjective to that of animals difficult.
One of the aspects is that the circuits that are almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal side Cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being even differs from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could be in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being linked to the language, this often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on the language, it would certainly influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our state of consciousness.
That is why it is as difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internally and subjectively, does not allow itself to be measured or, due to this particular hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily scientifically accessible.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that was exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of prefrontal Cortex in making visualization.
But what is the result of emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we dissociate as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the reactions of the body) accapates to the live memory.
As observed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states to imitate them to others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain trunk.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be fully involved in cross-cutting sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I think that is indiscriminable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear among men and rats is likely to be the same in both cases: how can we nevertheless check whether rats and men feel the same when they act in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from the danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not sufficient to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, while cafards do not even have a brain.
But is this the cause of the sensations?
And even if we could prove that to man: how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably completely different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behaviour rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, there is a need for nervous progress as the same is observed in rats and in man.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I do not know if they exist.
It could be considered short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than to constantly hit myself against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League of Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA is constantly looking at us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Football League PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee had met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki from the Polish PAP press agency.
"We assured the President of the UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have been sentenced, already in the previous season, for manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League has even had to be delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid Indicated counter-attack
She wanted to make promotion for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the sail on her ex adulterary Dennis Quaid.
He sparks - and counter-attack.
A late Rose War for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid couple: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are in a disgraceful battle - in view and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has been infidel to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The motive of this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his infidel husband's status fell clearly: it would be "monstrous", said he at the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg once again reverses the history of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would be more "repeatable," if "the pain and the shocks of divorce for each child were restored in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and will soon become the twin father.
Thus, his answer to the grip was: "In any case, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is best."
The prices of air tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become beneficial again - this is the result of a study by the American Express Financial Services and Travel Provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already decreased in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities still reviewed by 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than one year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a "declining desire for travel by American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, the prices of hotels stand with an increase of 26.3%, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, on average, passengers in the economic class had to pay 7.1% more than in 2007, long-court flights, which were very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2%.
From April to June, prices of economic-class bills fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business-class and in first-class, however, price changes were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices declined even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this drop in prices would, on the one hand, be a declining economic growth," the company explains.
Demand would yield land in many segments of the aircraft travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the trend is the removal by airlines of non-rentable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV Bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the top of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still failed to find an eleven functional.
The Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player came in late in the game and his lifted shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he was out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," sniffed Hermann Rieger in the dressing hall of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the dressing rooms, the mid-time was over and most of them had been rased in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic places.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquired and raised the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Where orders seem to have been similar: and that it jumps with this second goal!
The implementation has been missed.
"Everything was not very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "be more relaxed as well".
This 1:0 (1:0 in the mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head hit by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121 years this Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take back," Marcell Jansen said.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric goalkeeper, as Jansen decommissioned from FC Bayern - is, of course, slowly formed, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol said.
After the failure of the vote
At Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the rescue plan failure caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little bit.
Around 20:30, the world's largest stock exchange index was 10.579 points, with a decrease of over five per cent.
The Nasdaq Technology Fellowship Index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at this date American Express that lost almost 14 per cent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 per cent.
No titles could return any profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accounted for a decrease of almost 10 per cent.
Only a few days ago, the large investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilised for the purchase of what is called lost mortgage paper.
However, the amount should not be paid once, but gradually.
In return, the State should retrieve options on the financial corporation's shares that could be exchanged in relation to the course evolution in order to reduce the burden for the Public Treasury.
The courses of actions sought in the turbulence in Europe and the United States
billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not rely on the concerns of investors.
The course of the action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and draws the Dax to the bottom.
The US Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the state's financial market.
Significant declines in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank prices have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
Bavarian real estate finance has lost three quarters of its value at the moment despite the federal and private banks rescue operation, the Commerzbank has accused a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important 6000-point psychological bar and was at 5.839 points with a 3.7 per cent deficit.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion heavy rescue plan of the U.S. government could not be sufficient to reboot financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intends to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate is scheduled to take place on 1 October.
The other European scholarships also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has accused a decrease of 3.2 per cent at the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743,61 points after an increase from 1.26 per cent.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The multinational commercial and tourism company has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark material influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark material influences the speed of space probes during the so-called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" space probe has been flying in space.
Due to fuel conductions soon frozen, death cryogeneates the threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disruption among researchers - the anomalie of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they get additional momentum in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example, the Earth.
For example, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical tip, as was the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has been amazed by researchers for years: the flying objects do not always behave at 100 percent of the way it is expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
In addition, irregularities occur at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him the defect of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory, which describes the strength of the matter's attractiveness due to the curve of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes hardly that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomalie of gravitational support using what is called the black material that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The black material could be responsible for this anomalie, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black material for about ten years.
Apparently, it comes from a force of attraction with a visible effect on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, black material would nevertheless represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy confirmed.
The Sudanese rafters had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before release, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for ransom would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
World ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media jointly announced.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages were released.
We are checking their health condition," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert trip should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the release of hostages remain vague: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to stopping the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without screaming at a station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
There was nothing more left to collect hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers had killed six raiders in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt this Sunday, and had arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release women's hostages after the ransom payment.
The men had to be detained until the rapists found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was detained for six years after admitting eight indictors for indecent conduct.
Truro's High Court reported that he regularly binds his niece, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court was informed that Miss Randle, 34 years old, killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bound her before forced her to sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
His granddaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer member of National Trust, was persecuted of abuses that had been imposed on her twice a week.
The Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told me that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, since 2006 seemed "emotionally dead," and "has lost any hope for life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father, who had also written a letter of confession, which ended as follows: "I attached her and banded her regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of seven.
"This disastrous saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what is even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this gesture, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describes, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising and successful young woman today."
Convict for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, informed the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on his way when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train towards Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the BBC's hands before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intention.
The BBC correspondent, Frank Gardner said that this episode had many Whitehall people.
"They thought this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of breach of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause on the protection of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Secret Service Associate Committee
The documents that he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaida as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning, and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies face the B&B bill.
British building companies may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savings from Bradford & Bingleys.
Interests on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from the saving companies, including 59 building companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it was "irritating" to know that companies and their members would have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be refunded when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that harvest deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is annoying to see that institutions that have had a prudent behavior... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is announced that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Company Trade Committee, said to the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to the BBC.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that had a careful behaviour during the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to avoid that building companies and their members pay this salted bill," said Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid throughout the year, which could also double.
Since building companies are organizations without shareholders, their member ends by paying the invoice either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny to one litre, from Monday.
This is the second price increase following an increase of two pennies in February, and occurs as a result of a research carried out by a consulting society.
Retailers must decide whether they will in turn increase consumer prices.
. Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last varied, in 2002.
A former Pm from Bangladesh has been denied the bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a warranty request to the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which would be likely to be arrested when he returned to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said that the court refused to give him his warranty because of his trial for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This is one of the many accusations addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's always rival, was relaxed under bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has insisted that the country's provisional military government first give it all its freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, he did not see why he could not remain free when he returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's petition that she did not require a warranty because she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17th, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the Acting Military Government assumed power, but was released in June to treat herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, denies the accusations they are being made.
Inquiry studies for the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent police immunization campaign, because of Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
However, it states that it does not succeed in contacting children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's judicial battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the decision of the Competition Commission, which would require it to reduce its participation in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that MSkyB's participation in the past had prevented competition and allowed it to influencing ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed in fact at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus inciting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB argued that forced it to reduce its share of VIT would be unreasonable and, on the contrary, excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a Special Attorney to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
All was born from the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some departmental officers.
The report was critical to officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Attorney, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Strict allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accused capable of compelling witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department had stated that the prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which encouraged some observers to assign political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate fraudulent accusations of vote against the Democrats.
The U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the judiciary for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The report of the Inspector General was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first responsible" for these dismissals, and finally "abstaining" his role as leader," which was remarkablely successful in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the former Bush collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of having failed to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the London ceremony next week, said he was "honored" to get that recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
The evening of the award award is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf's.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was marketed in the United Kingdom, as single in 1979, ranking in the fifteenth place.
In addition, his Bat Out of Hell album remained in the English rankings for nine years, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of her real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure her an irregular heartbeat, after having collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Sombre Street in the City, often forgotten, and may soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents do not know how to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and travels north of First Street- not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 years long, it looks like a buzzing alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to retrieve Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, have said they are charmed by this shortcut simply because there is still one of the last and older streets of the pasture of houses.
But the Department of Conservation and Real Estate Development of the city, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighbouring owner committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay developed a proposal authorizing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers to stay the street in the city's hands, and asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month," said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few places left to belong to the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we wish to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to retrieve the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting of this month.
Michele de Milly, the speaker of Avalon Bay, said that although society wants to exploit the street, that doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner of it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to dress up this abandoned path, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest its sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Conservation of the Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, further stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colored neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been wearing this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the great farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The poster entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened again at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the picture covered by the Ramones album " Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of irons, sharks, bars, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the trend towards East Village's luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rareness-a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be ruined in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Amerious View of A City in the Process of Extinction") relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow asshole, dark day-to-night, and delimited by the doors of a roasted iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers of last week flying along the goutters."
A few exceptions near, the street always has the same way.
A short rat swinging at the bottom of the street, near a door that once led to the CBGB, which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 times empty beer, rests on the side of newspapers that have just been thrown.
Some passers reported rarely thinking at Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimated the attraction of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "is held in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former student member in California, and former director of the Education Department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you thought. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attiring the favors of the Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign stresses that "Afro-American and Latino students have less chance of graduating than white students" is a true fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports in particular among many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether its desire to achieve bilingual education that defends language class education other than English goes beyond its interest in eliminating differences.
For example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of Los Angeles.
Students in this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, are studying English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Likewise, almost 93% of students have completed the examination of English-language-arts
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focuses on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total English-language immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me, "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you were going without her class, you would not have had a chance to identify her."
"This works," she observes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed in the majority of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of them themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Obama's response.
Although he was in favour of the fact that immigrants learned English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue to be insignificant, when he declared that we all had to stop polemicing on the wording of the laws in English.
On the contrary, he said, "You must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than disdain them or consider them insignificant.
Nette du Petroleum Chute Follow-up to the New Inquisitions of the World Economics
Oil prices fell significantly on Monday, because people are afraid that the rescue plan for financial marches will not succeed in giving life to the economy.
Financial operations of crude oil, fell from 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 to the barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the raw materials markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial agitation, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 in the barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding to the deep uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are once again worried about the rescue agreement, the largest of history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The new has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be durable.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital's analysts said that the frenetic negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, did not seem to have succeeded in renewing the market."
While the economic situation is deteriorating, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
"the prospective of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" the German Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"We believe that raw materials cannot escape this infection.
"With regard to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
Bank analysts reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 per cent, the forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Determining Time Day for the Team Record Improvement.
After spending more time than anyone in Jets Shaun Ellis uniform during the last eight seasons, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He watched the second time, when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played badly under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a jump forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the mid-time.
"I didn't get out of my area" Favre said about all his passports to Coles.
"he's a poor player"
"We communicate very well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense beat the back quarter of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, caught a lost shot and made 32 yards up to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker, David Bowens left the ball out because of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals have taken control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets have recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could have marked in a time.
"The Jets Coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second or third time?"
When they told him the two- the Jets left to pass indisputable points in the third time- Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselassia rested, exceeded its world record.
Haile Gebrselassia, Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best bottom runner of the century, after defeating his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassia beat his record of 2:04:26 with 27 seconds last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassia won the 26th world record of its superb career during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassia had missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing that it might be exaggerated today, that air pollution would not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect sunny conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the arrival- Gebrselassia won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassia and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 .
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassia told the reporters, had suffered mole cramps two weeks before, and missed training for one week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I returned there last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
He was accused - especially in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia - of having overly orchestrated his races, avoiding the world marathon stars, actually counting on the lips as if they were in a track competition, and considering more global records than the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism does not reduce Gebrselassia's capacity as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassia after the runheads disappeared.
At a little more than three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassia made its final climb to take off from Kwambai, which ends second in 2:05:36, improving its best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, ended a remarkable year earning the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not take part in Beijing games because of a hypothetic back failure, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It ran using a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a great advantage and then exceeded them about 18miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, ended third in 2:25:01.
In a city in part, the pride and the trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its vast park, just a few miles from the sunset, the brilliant and giant Orlando, is a small quiet town where the pride and complications of the African American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood house, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to do today." The city at five lakes, three squares of croquets, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a pilgrimage city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival every year in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes- has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida Tourist Guide, published by The Depression era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was already in the 30s, when Hurston told that the black rural population in Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he loses".
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious in view of the foreign.
"We are very careful about how to tell history," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, residing forever and the oldest parishman in the city.
"it must be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of black power gain and a community of almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central but also an example of southern black rural culture - a few times disgraceful, other times acclaimed - which reminds the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her native city around the world through sincere, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to a chapter of black history and human drama.
As a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these well preserved playgrounds which Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn's sales of any kind of beverages as well as everything that can be used for people who are passing.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with analphabetization, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls, "Hurston immortalized, citing colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people did not appreciate."
We always remember Hurston as a living and excentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wearing pants here, where even today we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many laughed at her.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, walking in his chair of the poster patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary from Langston Hughes and the only black woman from Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in any grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, nor plate for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or inheritance she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to move a five-way motorway into town, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, two-way main street of the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville just returned from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mixing of races led hatred to the doors of the community.
"In that time, a band of white young people came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady even died."
They threw a paseque from their car."
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying of my race".
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"The black children were used to being kissed-- I remember- they kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and head of the Guard of the Community of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white-- I mean, there's a line of cultural demarcation here," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, by the way, have made it possible to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the damage, such as it, armed with joyful own trust and conduct lines such as: "How can they take away from the pleasure of my company!"
This goes beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, re-introduced it to the American canons.
The motorway project arrived just when the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston consider her a savior.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this motorway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival inauguration two years later, and many came back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the conte rejected the motorway proposal.
"The five-way motorway fiasco, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Miss. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summarized the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the motorway project enabled him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been visiting our church since 1993, began to come in a large number, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (reputed of course Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, rehearsed.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself as a back street later on a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Now 90 percent of blacks are counted)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask for permission for most interviews, and some things like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by white man, illustrating black men in the field-- should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave teacher, who has a weak for the vibrant red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people, in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston's entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossing, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is the sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the description Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think:" oh, this city has nothing compared to others," Alondra Kenon said after the Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to view history, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone speaks finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were staying away from the kiosk and giant TV screens at Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think only in glass and bee nest offices above their teeth, bankers and cover fund managers who monopolize New York, pass the worst "work day" to the office since the crack of 1929.
The carriers continue to fluff on the trottoirs, with their cars and muffins plates for morning meetings.
Latinos always hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, fifty luxurious shirts hanging onto a yoke placed on its shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the queue to buy their morning sandwich to ambulant merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I discovered to my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a twenty-five people who were driving the queue.
Not in front of the cash registers, nor in order to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service shop, where usual customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for direction for Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn of Starr, my "authorized personal banker", all made the queue for the same reason as I did.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from the savings accounts called thrifts (e.g. a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that operate only in a state, and who say treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have been bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a capital bank of $327 has used the bankruptcy union, and while the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, to save $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debase, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable, or the one that makes the most rescue to Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my Chinese local supermarket, talking to the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that banked, and her maid CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, my building's uniform concierge, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable trader.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money fund market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take a risk."
Muslim tombs profaned while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Flemish Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red-rayed mosques.
The Police accuses extremists of extreme right for profaning an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the end of the victory of the political parties of extreme Right to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; this is an organized action according to the police.
The offenders painted several tombs, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives think that this could have been done to disguise the feeling of hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This accident could in some way be related to elections.
A spokesman from the Islamic local community stated that it was "what shocked" to the announcement of this admonition, which just occurred during the month of the religious Ramadan that touched its end.
Austria seriously thinks of restoring its courage, following its oscillation to the right at yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two right-wing parties, which have scored almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign against immigration. Some of their slogans were even, according to the criticisms, considered xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 per cent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to food alhaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out right after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is forbidden to travel abroad.
The courts banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing his intention to the authorities under control to visit Spain through France.
The Kent Police had given this ban to travel last Thursday after proving to the magistrates the guilt of Glitter for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or under his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the court hearing in Ashford, but was nevertheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spoke on Thursday 25 September to the Ashford court, the Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be registered on the lists of accused sexual abuse.
It must inform the authorities if it wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
In addition, he must inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If it does not communicate its movements to the authorities, it could purge a sentence of up to five years of detention.
Kent's police said that she would not discuss any specific cases or potential moves of Glitter in the county.
A Kent police door said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect our children like those from abroad.
"For us, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the most expensive intention for the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those who are accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimise potential risks for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after purging 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, 10 and 11 years of age, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok where he had to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and at the end he left to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused his entry into their territory, and were therefore forced to return to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he should return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and, staying there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Limited Court of Justice of Uxbridge, West London, for the recorder in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as Scotland Yard requires.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no outer garments.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, freed from all tensions to get the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who don't care to get up on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatrality of a few plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less famous side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes on the particular flamenco iconography from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flame Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars.
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, remind classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
This is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is being presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty photographed artists.
The project has turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits presented to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a while or less.
I think in photography portrait is the most difficult genre.
You're in the face of people, characters you don't know sometimes or who leave you just a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas reality."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco titled "Flamenco - people" is presented at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at the 20th Street of Mata (rue parallel to the Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audace"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and treats unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through Amazon.
The favorite Nobel Prize of Literature yesterday confessed at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel currently occupying it "is a real audace" and that "all demonstrates that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people marshal in the city of the aquaduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants' voices, made a full room at the Juan Bravo theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, was confronted with a fascinated audience who did not see the past time when Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with a great amount of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "he's thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodical man" through intensive documentation work, correcting and rewriting part of the text to deal with his "miss of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "reduces less similar people", because the writers were asked to "don't let themselves go to frivolity" and assume their vocation.
Bad weather wastes the Pozoblanco Fair
The party of the banderillas that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended last morning, after the horse toreadors checked that the arena was unpracticable.
In this way, the organization committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The evil of the weather came to this fair, since in the end two of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race.
On the poster there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the Castilblanco arena
So only the Friday party took place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements face the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banderilles planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gradins applauded more than his struggle in themselves with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was sniffed by most audiences.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilograms of hachisch found
Five o'clock less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armenia (Alava).
The police arrest two occupants of a van and the last two take the leak.
Its loading, more than two tons of hachisch, which stops them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to the information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when various Alava Trafic Unit officials carried out a vehicle control on the N-1 at the border of the Municipality of Armion.
They were prepared to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the lower coast, where the two occupants went down to flee into a forested area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2.178 kilograms of hachish they transported and found after inspection of the van, an Iveco Daily.
The later part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch ballots. Then, they transferred it to a police station for comprehensive inspection and weighing the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with that written on the gray map of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a document falsification offence.
Ertzaintza continued his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A.A.J., has been warned to carry out the various steps and will be judged within the following hours.
The actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California, for driving under the effect of a drug.
One witness saw her doing strange manoeuvres trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to a spokesperson from the California police patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness explained that around 1630, Locklear "dressed the accelerator deep, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she rolled on her sunshine."
Shortly after, the witness, who had not recognized the actress at the beginning, saw Locklear stopping in the middle of the highway and leaving her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partly blocked the road.
"She seemed disorientated," that's why the agents led her to the drug and alcohol centre to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was co-operative and alcohol abuse was removed from the beginning, although "because of the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 19.00 and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was internated to cure herself from nervous depression.
Llamazares requested the Andalusian Federation of the Left Union to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the Left Union, Gaspar Llamazares, today stated that it was the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making favor treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am a very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization who will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behaviour of the political party he will have to adopt in the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the Left Union has requested that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Left Union has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party had "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's odd bet
Inspiring the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci restores the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist," he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in the movie rooms next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
The great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci, assures that he has achieved with this painting "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to make a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrilene, something he has always accepted when the story held on to national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid for Garci constitute a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain who has been misled by the fight as the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having received funding as for the films" Captain Alatrist" or "Ghosts of Goya" - more than double of that obtained for "Sangre de Mayo"-, because he couldn't turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he worked with almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not do casting, since it seems "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to theatre and cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Mayo Blood" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times as candidates for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de Mayo", "Seven French billiard tables" and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunsets", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"In the beginning you think you work for the seed, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you're just making an additional movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabelle Bayón sits in the skin of the sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three he will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to interpret the sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and that seemed amazing."
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a popular Cuban dance and "the serpent dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to her," she says.
The stage was made with two remarkable contributions: the one of Miguel Poveda, who will again sing Isabella in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and the one of Professor Matilde Coral, who had exceptionally wanted to work with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me."
The play was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón, the percussions of El Pájaro, the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, who plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were considered divas.
This work also, in some way, tells about the life of this woman who has been living in so far-reaching places, especially at the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think these women have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin at 20:30 pm at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first edition of the recently married poet's journal in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Zenobia Triennat and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" come to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This light population" which was opened last May and which, after traveling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "journal of a recently married poet", published by Pedro Tabenero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the work of one of the most famous andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"When God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in the absence of malice, and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all over America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time to get a Oscar
He hasn't been turning since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
This has been a hard hit for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," wept Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and patriots died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are scared, Americans' apprehension has fallen well down, looking desperately for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings than admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's enemy and defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honour of his elder who died due to overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had a hard time to oppose a suicide food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration sweep Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the oscarized Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, could name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has placed the bar high for us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there's the one who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he did not miss the opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a biteck in my fridge?", he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Beyond all the major roles he has interpreted, he has never been as proud as the devoteed husband, the loving father, the careful and philanthropic grandfather," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympics race
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid will be able to organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an eliminating note.
But let's look at it in detail and from the beginning.
The mistakes begin with the withdrawal of the backbones, which requires you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the back (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long waiting thread) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the suit (second error, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small size suits with less fabric and less expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, furthermore, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
Waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long wait, the competitions started and we hadn't left our backpack at the entrance yet, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting for more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and attacks took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not correctly mark the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, this would not come to my idea.
So I think we will always be able to dream of becoming the host city for 2016 J.O..
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtually)
At the Microsoft MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, a new system of recognition of human image and interaction was introduced, a type of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to the company's campus) in response to what was asked for during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, which they are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listening to and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also grouping them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that it is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and she tells her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were sold with the inevitable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has always added functions and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the understanding of computer equipment and software.
He performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operational system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People increasingly pay attention to the operating system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time navigating on the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Whoever can do the most can the least.
And Windows 7 must contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, fast months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I will give you an example.
The picture in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a showcases their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
After all, the phone looks more and more like a computer.
But since the launch of Android is late and iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso enclosed him on the coast of Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carried one in the 'Blue Diamond' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association of muscle gays.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also quote this moustachu coat that raised weights in an ambulant circus.
It's not just a male body suit made of cotton, molding and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels distinguishes itself among all others.
First, by his flambing name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - who has to do with sport because he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most well-known body suits have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tanks tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cachemire cardigans, cotton trousers, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate don't worry"
His enormous similarity with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz’s sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who borrow their name.
She was present to the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also to the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in Valentino's honour.
A very intense day, but at the same time exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The film of the 1950s and 60s enchants us and we are inspired by it very much for our collections.
I love walking in town and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
A dancer, an actress and a designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that, but at the end of the day, everything joins and these activities have a lot of things in common.
Since I was very small, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing myself.
The dancers love to dress themselves for courses and tests, to look into the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you end up the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the skin of the character.
Well, then, everything's tied.
You didn't have 30 years ago: has this been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological watch doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since every little one and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be mom?
Of course, I want to become mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose this.
With regard to the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm doing is to give my son a lot of happiness and to raise him with much love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you made last year to come out.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theatre, I'm very patient and worried, I'd like to have everything now, but of course it's not possible.
I'm looking forward to the movies 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo'.
Seeing what you'll think about it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get up on the bridge to make the mannequin.
Just, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for a long time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association to support women and the clothes we exhibit - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for the Naomi NGO.
People that Naomi is a tender person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to walk for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to pear it, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
The recidivists of the alcohol to the driver must install the 'alcolock' system.
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholicity to install a system in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from being drunk, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which it is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Routine Safety and the Institute of Technology for Auto Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists who have been arrested for driving more than once in a drunken state, the car resumes.
The Alcolock would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the authorized.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the charge of the driver.
In this regard, a study in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65 per cent of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save life to 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out by regular means, but, however, criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Especially tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 1740 hours, the scheduled official time, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias travelled landed in the Presidential Hangar at the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of bed, but its rays were still forced to put the hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes visited the city to complete their official journey.
- Oh, well, then we can't go to the airport to take customers at this time... are you out of here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here for two years.
- Oh, well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed with marine blue, the Princess, when she has hair in the wind, is very seamlessly dressed and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going to the room where the official cortège awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no living designer, more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded by a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's window at the 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and she almost cried of emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us meet in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the next table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
By having big on the heart and making bad fortune good heart, due to the recent death of his brother, Nati set up a garment of Mango and a few beads of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arms on it, arm below with her son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, Mango's owner, a galant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil finished the evening without jacket because they had loaned them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented himself to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and which for dinner changed by enclosing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of ballets and remembering the good old times, she seized one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'great folded'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for visiting the hangings of the palace, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before.
The next morning, we had the pleasure to see Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man moving on the bike – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Paris Intercontinental Hotel, with his sheets, towels and asking beforehand that there are no smells in his room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the number of anti-stress
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the libraries on September 30.
The morning wake-up almost attracts us when it rings every morning at 7:00, but it's even worse when you think of the agitated pace that today's life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and labour-related problems.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or treatments 'spa', Susannah Marriott brings together a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each book.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax ' and will arrive directly at the libraries of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relations, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural revenues that help you relax.
If the adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore the balance of your body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, unconnect his mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It's a benign alteration of sleep called somnolocia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking during the night.
This may occur very sporadically (e.g. in life associated with an episode of severe fever), or more periodically (all days, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child doesn't remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often associated with other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresies (sleeping in bed) or sleeping, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very severe fever, stress or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or, on the contrary, with screams, crying, long speeches ...
In cases where sleeping becomes very common, it would be useful to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said that it is a benign impairment, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep impairment that can be treated (e.g., if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
Therefore, looking for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty in relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm themselves inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleeps appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and so rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don't have the temptation to question him to get information.
You won't get anything, because when you sleep, he's not conscious of being able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you won't know what he's dreaming about, let's take care of how you interpret the information and the conclusions you're drawing from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even by joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhauzern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory in his field after a long period of dissatisfaction.
Without making a big game, the Yellow and Blacks created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who frowned the lucarne on a far shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascent and turn Fonderflick far away, then with Hirn above, Roman from the end of the foot or Diebold came chatting the defense of Dannemarie.
On the face, we were blocked in the middle of the field and we just left Riahi muzzling at the top of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a repulsed bullet on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Holhousian killer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the vestiaires a dozen minutes later and thus leave his partners in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose major problems to a eleven illhousian who just stepped back a bit to "compact" her defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big cafousing, the bullet passed very close to the cross-section.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before going to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to turn through Brittany.
Faced with the force demonstration of fishermen who have severely disturbed the access of several Breton and Normandian ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the Bretish fishermen to obtain measures to cope with the flow of gasoline prices, which reached an average record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesman of Elysée David Martinon, the president will "discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies recover competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of the seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen firmly.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snake operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, with close to 10 km locks.
Quiberon's port of pleasure was also blocked, but the links to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filtering dam was launched on the near island of Quiberon.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel deposits in Brest and Lorient, from the dawn, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic and the Channel façade, such as the Sands of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained in the quay, or in Havre, where twenty ships have blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Donges total refinery in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the department to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Fisheries Committee in Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas oil, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a gas oil less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home at Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft operator tabled on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession on the world economy.
The fourth global aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 deliveries, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft shipped 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider transferring more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have overflowed, intends to hand over 15% of its assets over to reimburse the $85 billion that has been advanced to him, according to the Dominican Edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its life insurance to the international and its retirement activity in the United States, explains the newspaper that quotes sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met Sunday in the evening to review possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds FT.
No definitive decision has been taken on these transfers, FT continues.
AIG must quickly achieve liquidity to reimburse the loan of 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve to the risk that the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in proportion.
Analysis Paris History of the Meeting Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a never seen loss approaching the 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped from 777.88 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the greatest fall in his history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with a dominant technology, gave 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's index 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street went down after the unexpected rejection of the Bank Rescue Plan by the House of Representatives, which would allow for a little stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives refused to the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This shows how important the market was in this field," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will be "too late".
"If the project is actually moribond... then the relay will quickly be transferred to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the feeling of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Ms. Piegza.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, pushing for emergency responses to banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only a US crisis, but a global crisis", added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Treasury's 10-year-old return declined to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and that on 30 to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama, winner at the points of the first TV duel
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates for the White House, another succeeded to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic Campaign QGs announced their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although Honourable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to stop his decline in the five-week presidential surveys.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% McCain), believes that it is the Democrat who pulled off the game.
Of the indecisive voters, who are the counting ones, Obama came out winner for 39 per cent of the surveyed, while 25 per cent of them gave McCain the victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected by his colister, Joseph Biden, in the first and unique public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"This would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The Septuagnarian McCain has always highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while underlining the "naïve" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be president," he also assured.
An angle of attack tortured since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without decommissioning, it proved to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if," retorted, this weekend, a democracy spot accusing the Republican of not having taken all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street".
"Thanks to the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a beaten rain.
He has not even spoken the words "average class" or "workers"." The financial detour clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most able to save the economy on the edge of the rainfall.
"The next week could be a decisive turning point," said the honourable senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
The representative of Democrat Rahm Emanuel, a former of Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" with Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democrat candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating that it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite Wall Street's sobresauts, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates evaded the issues relating to the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely impopular.
In Minsk, "You noticed there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents protested Sunday night in the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night after the closing of the polling stations in the Central Place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they have not even voted: "What good, because they do what they want from my voice," says a young person.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good figure for foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the demolition," deplored Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasises Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the 2006 Presidential Opposition and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is the voices, and in us, it is the executive power.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean television space, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily debted to Russia, comes into crisis and we are not reforming, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the election.
She stressed that the number of participations seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26% of the voters in Minsk) had opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, do you?" questioned social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition to Parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Blood back safe
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he recognized the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the rage of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at highlighting the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and formulating recommendations that such a disaster should no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was late to submit his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee completed this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, barely 38 per cent of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
With a strong effort to improve the safety of blood and work products on the ground over the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said, proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Decary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
As of its establishment, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle on 28 September 1998.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the crazy cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were witnessed in Europe, explains the one that has been strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, that when one does not know and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had been in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980 was therefore denied.
A few years ago, however, it was undoubtedly demonstrated that this disease was transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied was meaningful."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique was found on the market: Nucleic Acid (TAN) tests that directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have allowed to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowing and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Decary, stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"Demands increase because the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which is on average only 3 per cent of the Quebec people eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person aged 18 years and older who meets the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is present, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to keep them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
As today's life is so terrified, one rarely finds the time to spend an hour giving her blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides blood products, but also human tissues, including bone transplantations, heart valves, eye gloves and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burned people.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The ombilical cord that was previously considered to be a biomedical waste contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our 1,000th sample of cord blood, and we expect it to take more than 1,000 a year.
We should start proposing it for transplants at the beginning of next year," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"More mothers are disappointed to be unable to access it," because Héma-Québec has no means of proposing this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Half-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the final series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 total of goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series total of goals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The field center Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal on one side as on the other, the field center David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
On Friday, during the first game of the return series, the Impact had suffered a defeat of 2-1 at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
Saturday evening at Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps have nevertheless reached the 5-4 half final round in total.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Victorious goal of Kovalev
The Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win with the dam shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec picked up two helpers, and Kovalev picked a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the sole purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another match to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He had a beautiful onion."
Charest placed on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude opening elections before the end of the year
Soon as the Liberal Party General Council was completed, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to be elected on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Rejecting the limits of our last major northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin with images.
On three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as in the electoral period.
In the press point, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would trigger elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his timetable was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th parallel - had never been presented.
The Prime Minister, however, confined itself to explain why the North was "a jewel with enormous potential," but did not give time, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest.
This "area twice as large as France," "it's our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it at our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as well as to show that he applied for a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the golden road in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"This is our future," he added, after having taken a theatre break to look at the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, explained the Prime Minister at the press point.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity comes, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, talking about the northwest crossing, which will open all year round due to the glazing of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former penitential member of Ungava), have already initiated consultations with thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "one will give one another a common vision".
Northern development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded it.
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the end of the week, which began on Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename Central Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, which made the peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, in Bourassa, which made the Baie James, our party sucked the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press point, he referred to another reference, the Conservative, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its implementation was planned for 2012.
"It's staying between us, but I'm expecting to be there," he entrusted to his activists, stimulating fostered applause at their homes.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of launching a poll this fall, as the law allows him.
However, he stressed that his schedule was fulfilled, including a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the end of the week has provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which have been posted as a letter: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wanted Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Board and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The penitential leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from North Quebec's Development Policy that Landry's government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "We would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois along with her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The QAD said that it supported the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it is not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (o irony) in Harper's firm, who last summer allowed himself to tell Louise Arbour that she was a "honorable" for Canada.
In this way, shame this woman who has fought for justice and deserves all our admiration as long as she says about the surroundings of the Prime Minister as Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts charged to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies his word and lets a child and a soldier in inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes to a parodie of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, advocate for Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes eyes on torture: it doesn't matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but at the moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", the word Harper keeps burning and sounding so shy in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morality exists: we can malmize, torture, arbitrarily capture a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a leader of government so far (what will be after October 14,...).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what has done the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17th edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
In pursuing an orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest auriff company has pursued a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the boom in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely occulted by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best way of conducting a public debate be to lead to the ruin of anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his or her?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the Book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unlike weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost unfounded mining pockets.
The tactic, in these inequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a settlement to the friendly who will ruin the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada usually take place through the exchange of ideas and not by scratches.
So it was enough for the miner to open up its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have made light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada from the back of the hand.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to the paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized argument exchanges, and not in the context of what many people see as a prosecutive (continuing the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a call to the place of the authors of Black Canada calling for them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's over-real speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to quote credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that defame the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's dismayed pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she does not want a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place arrangements to limit such abuses of prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both Congress Chambers.
It includes: better control by the electorate of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure to pay, and a right to look at salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
The US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, after a two-day bargaining marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush's representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and the ordinary Americans from the current crisis in Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, trauma, chaos and disruptions on the lives of the Americans will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last few hours because of fear of the effect of a new failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit we had agreed was to open the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were rather favoured by the agreement, but without expressing their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
Senator Barack Obama has committed itself to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including those aimed at enabling owners to retain their home and on the salaries of the heads of the state-backed companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no reason to welcome.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked on another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope yes."
"The great lines I've read [mount] that this is something that we all will have to digest and with which we will be able to progress.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the suspicious, risk-based and invenable claims from US financial institutions.
It occurs after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the break-up of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulting in a liquidity freeze and the decay of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of republikan elects who had put the first draft agreement down last week.
It is believed that this impasse has emerged since the democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government was to assume losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion, which can be added to 100 other billion if the President considers it necessary.
The further 350 billion payment should be supported by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will obtain participations in the rescued companies that will benefit him from dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to sell when the pain is passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and departure allowances paid to the managers of the affected companies.
Architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, there continued to be votes against this project, both in the Republican and the Democratic camp.
"Evidently, Washington does not hear you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, to his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that involves benefiting taxpayers."
Animator of a small group in Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", the representative of the Democrat Brad Sherman presented things differently, but came to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred leading economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: Congress is asked not to press and carefully examine the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis bank group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had renounced the acquisition of its competitor in full ruin since it lost €2 billion (2.9 billion) in the crisis of risk-based real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
In exchange, a right of vote is recovered in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and households now appreciate that time appears to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank that was misled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion US (75,5 billion) real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azur was long his card at stake, some will say his weakness.
Was he freed from the narcistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His pudder, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great back runner!
Paul Newman, missing on Friday, at 83, following a lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of the American film of the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and whose long was a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of freedom and the break-up of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without the ego demesured, ultimate quality mark.
For in him, a whole country enchanted by the self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied drama art in Yale and attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television, soon in cinema.
The same man who militiated for civil rights was also the driver of the car who ranked himself second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadow areas of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic to the shrinks of the show business, of which we have not fully perceived the spark.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman caused dizziness to the cinemas this weekend, while his major roles were intercepted on the black screen of memories.
More than a half-century of a seventh American art in everlasting change is wandering through him.
Back in memory, the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on an adapted burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More close to us (1990), we are referring to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all of his promises.
Many other Paul Newman have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, offender, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Someone Up There Likes Me (Marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, who took over after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathic malfrat in the brilliance The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and revenge player in Robert Rossen's beautiful The Hustler (1961), he will rename the character on the return to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who in 1987 valued his unique Oscar on nine nominations.
That face through ages, it was him.
He again.
The times are rushing through his course.
Young people know it mainly through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot cult (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a low-orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen brothers.
With a last sponsorship role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several legends of the film that released the profession soon enough, Newman will remain in seam for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, his ears, his fasts and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a living challenge at "underplaying" and considered his benefits too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the bec.
However, he played less often the first young people than the marginals: nefrosized, alcoholic, assholes or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drains and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unfamiliar facets of his true pudid sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 ( according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traced a final female portrait of melancholic.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicateed his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of pudeur and sadness.
Among the homage rain on Newman yesterday, his great friend Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Genericity, love of existence are vibrating features of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood's drifts, is also erased.
We have seen a lot of his binette throne on vinegar pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judgeing the process of a bad taste, though gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to his Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, has committed himself to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Every day and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so luxurious and so generous.

What could Zuschlag &amp; Company make in their invoice factory?
Next, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly serious damage, and other indictors have been arrested against them, for example, falsehood and use of falsehood.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The government's and municipalities' money, approximately HUF 65 million in total, went to the Fiatal Baloldal movement's funds on the one hand and to some people's pockets on the other.
Their method, also made public by the investigation authorities, was to raise the money from subsidies obtained by issuing cost invoices, which did not provide any real benefit, and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the bills were false.
For the latter, they purchased billbooks at the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies to be included on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, he had to identify pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and by his accomplice András Ελλάδαri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files necessary to obtain the grants.
In a "recording circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 persons, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will subsequently bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, has been defective in forms and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned 100 30 customers.
In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor the name of Hoppa appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, said to the site hvg.hu that when the prosecutor called him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, hundred people had stayed there, did not stick, either, because this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Emittents of zealous invoices did not also learn about the travel agencies in Budapest, as part of their choice, but only arranged travel abroad. Thus, naively, they reported stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the Agency's accounting practices.
As it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, while travel services, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the hotel's employees issue only printed invoices, while the false invoices were handwritten.
The Public Prosecutor's investigation revealed that "emittents" also made mistakes by mentioning as a delivery the carriage of goods by road, that the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for shortcomings of forms, such as inappropriate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
Just as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sports internship of Kunfehértó, which both denies being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when Fiatal Városért Egyesület's group was supposed to take a meal at their home. According to our information, that is why the company's liquidator refused to issue the invoice.
Contingently established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictive invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták group, established an invoice on the order of the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to the issue of false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Likewise, it cooperated with Zuschlags, the Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices under the order of Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place either since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this has prevented the organizations from mentioning it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued invoices in the order of Atlasz, Hopá and Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he took their countervalue.
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masonries have created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the company's foundation acts, he established invoices on their names, on the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the sums on the invoices as well as VAT were going into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for a double amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictive invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, a part of the accused will relate to the method of making the invoices, as it had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the principal accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the sail on the whole history.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that in return for a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would carry the hat alone.
Today, the latter is likely to be offended, since applications for the place of residence under supervision, based on a reduction in the conditions of detention, are constantly falling into the ear of a deaf.
While those who have caused much more damage, and those who have committed unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least at their own home, await the end of the procedure. He has no such opportunity.
The psychology of the auction: why do we spend more money?
In auction sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economy at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in Science magazine, human beings do not want to be distanced in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that's why they even prefer to pay too high prices.
These research attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the volunteer groups played the lottery, while the other group participated in auctioning ludics, while the researchers, using a functional magnetic resonance process (MRIf), analysed the active brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, whose essential element is the third-party overauction, the group under the cerebral trunk, called striatum, moved intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulating" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak before the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economist members of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In these cases, three groups were confronted with a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question and thus carried out their implementation.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were going to win the game, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money in case they lost the auctions.
In fact, the difference between these two groups is that one focuses on victory, while the other focuses on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the players' team "contre failure" was willing to make higher bets than those made by the control group and the "for victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theories.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctioning only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by developing, now, a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When do we have to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that 100 miles of patients who carry the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are undergoing treatment, because they often do not know that they carry the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to liver-related infections caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Liver inflammation and yellowishness are characteristic, but pathogens and caused diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tube (e.g.: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperma, vaginal secretion, saliva).
In any case, it is recommended for travellers to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by general disorder, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then a visible yellowishness develops on the skin and on the white eye, the sheaths become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year, around the world, one million people die of the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know that the virus is affected, because the pathogenic gene destroys the liver cells in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms occur only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
At present, there are 200 million chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is advised to consult a doctor who treats as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, held for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing patients around the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of the early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesis, which would already have helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford have achieved an interesting experience analysing at what level belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this experience for the least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many athletes were subjected to electrochocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a palpation technique of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the control of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from various sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience is as follows: an instrument emitting sparkles and diffusing electrochocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look sustainably at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady of the Hermine painted by Leonardo de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the beginning of this experience hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would refer to a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was about its relaxing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electrochocks in four consecutive parts, while watching either religious theme painting or more general theme painting.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe," like someone whose care is taken, and they " calmed themselves, and peace invaded them."
In view of the religious theme painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image against which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is no more than the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if a Madone painted by Leonard or a painter of the same calibre was shown to the believers?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary result in better results?
You're what you're revealing about you.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found in the bottom of the people's pocket in the same way as the sky above their head. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what are their centres of interest.
However, it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, which is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's vision of horror, they do not really see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary to enable Google's founders to meet their initial goal, which sounded as follows: "Let us collect all the information from the world in a system!".
According to Google's director, after ten years of global chambouling work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
On the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the best job for me?". However, software will not be able to answer this type of question, simply at first sight, until the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer launching the search and the pages then consulted by interested people are exactly listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users, for example, can store their own research history and can consult what they have been looking for, on what they have clicked on. This, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more customized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what is my work? ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or, possibly, the revolt against the power that can cause a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of users.
The most reluctant example in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus enabling an identification.
Person rights-affected Internet users were able to push a sweep of relief in May last, when Google, on top of the EFF EFF legal protection body, proved his right to court before the FBI. According to the judgement made in the future, Google will still not be required by any of the Constitutional points to disclose information about the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of search that it had won in relation to strengthening the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier, but ultimately it failed to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: it is fused by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the proud multinational corporations of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "saviors" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of major companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as a world invader because of Windows, and this, even though both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official giant of the software.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and that web 2.0, the most pronounced keyword of recent years, is just behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, that the fact that we deliberately leave traces behind, and that we use communications channels available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essence remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a prosecuting system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While you can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society who has dismissed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is completely to be reconsidered today.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and that is how we can define the principle behind the behaviour of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, can do it (e.g., starting with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time leaving intentionally no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is impossible to find them is not the least. Google's online services, through the processing of text to image processing, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which has existed so far.
Public opinion expects, without really hiding from it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasing rate are causing serious migration not only to Microsoft, but also to many other computer programs creators.
However, the critical observers find, besides all this, contradictions with worrying effects: e.g., the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after doubled the price of the business mother and after the society has found the cost of daily multiple restoration, taken at any time. All this seems unreasonable, besides the fact that Google already acquired before the Chinese government in 2006, and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is clear is that in the coming months and years they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's scanning and archiving of books and magazines takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the Supreme Court of the United States, others are trembling in front of its health system, because in this one can build a full medical benefit based on our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached scaryly only through Google's data.
Two minors helped to remove traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police convened two minors to question them in the case of the double murder of Ózd. Based on well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove traces of the crime." - said the spokesperson of the Borsod Department Police Office.
Young people have recognized the facts that are being charged with them, and for the moment they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder can lead to imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of Ózd's double homicide, a 23-year-old young man, was put in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that's why he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old daughter of this man.
According to information from the ITI, the young man predicted his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of that.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Fellowship makes a proposal for the purchase of Prague Fellowship
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, approximately five billion Czech kronor, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package from the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that Poland had made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw scholarship is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech Economic Daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the Director of the Prague Fellowship, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Fellowship would be the cheapest new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Fellowship in the future.
The value of the Prague Fellowship is estimated from 5 to 10 billion Czech kronor by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 per cent of participations, followed by 14,7 per cent of Ceská Sporitelna Bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
In their commentary on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is increasing from day to day, the leaders of the European press already refer to a "second September 11".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American President" - accuses Rome's daily, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill improvised to the Vávite to help a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrilen press also sees the emissary bow in Washington.
According to the vision of the El Mundo daily, it was the shortcomings of the political direction from there that brought the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world will pay the high price.
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote of the Congress, a real danger threat, which Washington does not offer as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored longer - emphasises the Geneva Day-Anzeiger.
Some states can still devote a rescue buoy to their titubing financial organizations, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse, such as dominos, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need that the states of the European Union do little to their national selfishness and centralise control over the divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weak financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to put hands on the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
To date, the EU has not really been dealing with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is crossing the old continent.
"Savers" should not immediately burn EUR 100 billion, but it would be reasonable if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing major damage.
Smart car imitates the bourdon's flight
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an existing barrier detector already in nature?
Like, for example, the bee.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, which took place in Japan, bourdoning bees gave the strategic idea of starting with Nissan's engineers, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacles detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-roboted system of BR23C, which he equipped with bee qualities, the final aim being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own oval space, which in reality resembles much our secured protection shell - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and public technological relations of the brand.
The face-to-face eye of the bee plays an important role, as it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the facet-to-face eye, engineers discussed the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the bow microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system at present, this avoidance manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
"If this was not the case, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratoire Mobilité and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where collision is currently considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a glance.
Contrary to bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonal, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations of bees to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotational movement, acceleration and slowdown as manoeuvres were used at the disposal of the mini auto robot
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and the energy concentrate is larger, making their lifetime longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is essential, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only deal with a few signals entering each second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of the previous manoeuvres. In this way, it only uses a few dozen kilo-octets of memory on a continuous basis.
We don't need a memory of giga-octet capacity, nor even giga-octets.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter the cars made in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at repurchasing doubtful bank credits, and to be used several times, is ready.
At first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during new debates extending until midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American Chamber of Representatives, that it is only left to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, commented on the outcome of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of saving Wall Street here, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the opposite direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20:00, Washington's local time (i.e. Monday at 2:00 in the morning, according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposed Act in response to the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made this night, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
In addition, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of securities with doubtful credits.
From now on, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the Act has been adopted by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase doubtful claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left at the discretion of the President.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The second half of the 700 billion is dependent on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury secretariat will be able to develop a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase suspicious claims, securities covering mortgages and suspicious mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases may take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concerns, for which companies have paid a premium equivalent to predictable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large purchase of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system causing the collapse of one or more important financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary measures, to be ready to implement the law, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in bad positions and waiting for State assistance can expect their starting allowances, called simply golden parachute outside the Atlantic, to be ceilingd by the government.
The wage ceiling is only mentioned in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its support to the company.
The principle of the ceiling means that if the Treasury secretariat buys back in an auction, they will take over a golden parachute tax surplus unless the bank's discredited president retires.
Directly after the purchase of doubtful claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not excessive.
For the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The ceiling only concerns new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force on the appointments of the Directors-General - commented the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that within the next five years, the President will have to submit a proposal to the Congress to decide on how losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were, of course, those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why American citizens have mandated us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican MP of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democrat colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that the same people press the action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing of products and chemicals (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), in the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a significant weight in national industrial production, prices have risen by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, prices in the oil processing sector were the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacturing of metallurgical products, price increases were observed by 13.2%, while in the important field of food, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent) as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).

Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that the American-Hungarian Visa Exemption Agreement will enter into force by 12 January, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "it now depends only on the moment when electronic input and control systems across the Atlantic will be in service".
Every time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will bring the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Star of the Order of merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the candidates for the Presidency, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, provided their support to the $700 billion government rescue plan. However, there are politicians who require the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress and Administration finally announced Sunday in the dawn that they had reached basic banks rescue agreements.
This funding plan, aimed at the freezing of Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even appear, each as more suitable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again succeeded in obtaining a little advance. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a co-lister just after the Republican Convention, has merged.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit, Sunday, Obama expressed its hope that Congress would soon vote the 700 billion rescue plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contained consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain's economic ideas were not missed.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said, "We will all have trouble swallowing it... but nothing to do is not a possible way."
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentioned the establishment of a Treasury Board of Auditors and the setting-up of the starting allowances for senior leaders, and that he was personally very committed to these issues.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not have a substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the Chamber of Representatives, said on Sunday that there was serious hope that the Chamber would vote on the bill from Monday.
The press release of the German language territory
The right camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, mentions.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria eats his fathers".
According to this recognized politiologist, the CSU erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took his duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is the same modern citizens who turn their back.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday, a process that was likely to happen, just ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of the national party has been completed.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU grew up with 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so mentioned Stoiber.
This can be attributed to the modernization of its parents, established in the region consistently by the CSU.
It has been forty years that sociologists have announced this, but they have been very mistaken about the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the North and East in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, only within the party have the voters become more conscious, more critical and more enthusiastic.
It is also surprising that, in recent weeks, it is precisely the group of classical citizens who have been rather distant from the CSU, such as independents, craftsmen, holders of the bac and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for CSU decreased by less than 40 per cent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the reservation with regard to the questions of the coalition", the Conservative Austrian daily takes care of the situation of the confused internal policy that emerged after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids SPÖ to interfere with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ Populist Party is open to negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything is turning around the coalition; in the public television debates, party leaders have hardly let their cards come across.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the social partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer responded carefully to the red proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann attempts to interfere with the internal affairs of the POP.
In its party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is at the moment a very open issue, which must certainly be debated within the EPA.
Jörg Haider, the president of BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, the host of which is France, as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union, began.
In his message to the plenary session, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party Fidesz, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law most affecting Roma children and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and, on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party Group, Járóka warned that, in addition to the distinctions found during the recruitments, Roma disappeared from the labour market, primarily because of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and due to elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a degree of higher education."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education as the basic right of human beings plays a key role in promoting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member of the European Parliament, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Due to their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and protected from low quality and sectary education." - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary to speed up the process of disaggregation of schools immediately. To this end, compliance with existing and preparatory anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment. We need to give the opportunities guaranteed by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of right in the future of Europe" - said Járóka.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities held every year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a unique platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transition period
It is in October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite this terrible electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place.
The fate of the tandem, with a disastrous loss of voice of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party Congress, held on the last weekend of October.
In any case, members of this highly criticized pair felt that they did not hold their seats in particular.
Thanks to this, they used to relax the angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stiober, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stiober, there is only 44.4 per cent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria's "unique sovereign" giving 18 per cent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives are still highly counting in this southern region, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reform of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister for Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Liberals, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich Government.
A strange nose of destiny was only with the help of the list of Free Electors, the Gabriele Pauli, whose measure against Stroiber was used as the possibility of a putsch made by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then without household treatment of the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the strings in the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, on 28 September, has designated as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched a few acerbious comments to the CDU. He said they deserved much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor again if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding hardly his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the land loss of the CSU will not in a negative way affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue to last.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6% in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition joined the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, who ensures prosperity and stability for him, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by irregularities committed during the demolition of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation consisting of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very well oppositioned for many decades before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing its presidential mandate for the fourth time in doubtful elections, would "permit" the presence of a few members of the opposition in Parliament on the traces of the change in the Constitution in 2006.
In this way, ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the decline in Russian natural gas imports, which was increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, has passed over to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, emphasised positive changes rather than failures, such as the prohibition of a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior relief.
However, the OSCE communiqué of Monday already contested the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when voting.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have restored freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia, with which Belarus forms a paper-based confederation, has already considered the two independent territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has been launched" - said Alexandre Milinkevitch to our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, even though "the power has had fear in this Parliament which has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not provide for protests on the basis of the results, rather than trying to send its message on the need for economic reforms among voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concern on this side: we have to print our opponent newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us on the wheels in terms of dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older people" - said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the most formally supported pensioners layer does not really consider it to be appropriate.
"Due to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, "which raises the silence of a cemetery, is no longer a matter of time," says Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words, but in acts." Thus, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, no aircraft had turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in force against the little malicious, against whom point and then go to drink the coffee at the bar during the hours of work.
The anti-spinning novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors- says Brunetta- are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the Minister.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism," Brunetta further emphasizes.
The establishment in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees has been recorded, says the Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Promesse de Brunetta, who suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. is an excellent and welcoming resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of the Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister reports that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has declined by 50%, i.e. 60 million more workers in one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make more effective, Public Administration .
Italian, "who are wage dynamics- explains the Minister- over the past 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and also inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees were united to challenge the Brunetta Decree standards using the Codacons.
"Depending on the fact that the Minister of Public Service is currently investigating data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness-writing the association of consumers-the people of "active" faints continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare war on the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of disability due to service; the extension of hours of permanent hometime of the sick worker, during which check visits are conducted, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Certain prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 dead and 27 persons who remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to get the attention of institutions, social forces and information resources on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil today celebrates, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The alarming data circulated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at work," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association of Men and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its " sincere appreciation for the continued associative effort to prevent accidents at work, the protection of accidental workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion"
"Naturally unfamiliar, everyone has hit the bow to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, raise the clamer of the media and the participation of the public opinion, even though the daily reality presents dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that " there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the labour world.
It is our duty, to keep the attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the House of Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data from accidents at work seem to indicate a slightly positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," stressed the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later.
"We don't want this "reduction trend" to be translated into a minor attention, because it is just when attention relaxs, the tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"In our view, Mercandelli has stressed- more controls and inspections are necessary, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added- "that further efforts must be made in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercondelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding compensation for labour victims" and "the development of assistance to which the system has been aligned in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the destiny of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneousness or the extension of the legislator"
Mp3 pointed from the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full volume music for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communication issued in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"from this scientific report-- let us read in the note-- it shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable music devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use full volume portable music devices and mobile phones can unconsciously harm their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data, the responsible Ue continues - this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information publicly available.
In addition, we need to review existing control systems, given scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels requested the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise caused by them.
"The scientists-concludes the Ue- executive confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures might be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concerns about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are increasing.
Such data may be clearly limited using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
The Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level at work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This attracts 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to approximately 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitole for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitole and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it would like to emphasise Alemanno - it would have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which could be used by the political decision-makers, which remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a specific time-limit.
In June-announces the Mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno responds: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure that its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is aggravated by the management of daily and emergency situations that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see from the forward, and beyond, towards a deeper prospective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome would like to emphasise that "this Commission is not a unnecessary body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman towns, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligence that expresses the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "there is a need for a strategic, neither firm nor immobile draft to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while considering its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, according to the Mayor of Rome, will "not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to become independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the other hand, destroyed the US economy and had relationships (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections is closer.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really steadfast: he believes he will gain the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; they are, of course, racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will it be a good president? Furthermore, we have polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississipi newspaper, in the South of the United States, wrote an article: once in the polling cabin, we know who the American patriot will vote.
This is what emerges from an aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Thus what you want, we'll even see we put the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Choices never revealed until now, so far that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
One hundred people were asked: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 per cent responded: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand mile soldiers and was returned to her home with a foot on its ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make their suitcases.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, the weakness of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge spot to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debase is even felt in the journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "mörder" of the newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as they used to.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the removals made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work in the assembling of newspapers, are a major problem.
It is a problem that, according to the interviewed journalists, should be solved if traditional journalism, as the general public hears it, should not be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and printing newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishers' homes run a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to the technology that hoped that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest aggression in American journalism lies among those who run newsrooms, i.e. directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to the "security of work".
Directors who think they lose their job in the space of 3 years are 47% at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we're going to be 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (no editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it becomes quickly a question of taking or leaving.
Directors receive almost always high wages, while the editor can earn $10 million a month in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As far as holidays are concerned, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days at all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "malades" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankroad in the framework of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
During his trial last week, he had obtained the home release transformed into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the province city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the Pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accused him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its predecessor East Coast, moderate, favouring federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of finance, which is powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, rightly, that was felt despotically with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake has already announced or lets run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not only be here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the events that have been devastated for some time, so that in the new climate they become stronger and manifest.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualisation, the extraordinary recovery, of the double class of sovereign state, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, of course, have close relations with the foreigner, but which are primarily involved to a large extent, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it governs: it is to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play or does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide on a common political line.
And so it is from the government of each State that everyone is waiting for interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection of credit: when we pass through a difficult period, there are only States with economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to restore things.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever have the same access.
This new phase of the State-National crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a rather factor related to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxally, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the kingdom of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future would, on the contrary, have to settle its accounts more and more with things that are fairly material, such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumcised space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the chance to live in a place without harvest, oil and water.
I now come to the second newness which, however, anticipates a fracture.
Who says Territorial, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and thus Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On one side, the consciousness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow areas.
In addition, something further deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus, even more the belief of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elite until now, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, underground, fuels a powerful and ramified movement of delegates from the leading classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised "revolts" of elections or well, in the changes in the collective moods of the latter all the last time, from the conservative ascent in Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Great Britain, to the revolt of American Congressists against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone, would have more and more difficulty, which is not from today, to understand and thus represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis can strengthen, increase and act in a disproportionate way.
In view of all of this, talking about a current "rebellion of masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep your eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Winning the laws of gravity through a super glue and, in the future, walking on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded there.
With a adhesive measuring barely 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to stick a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American magazine Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Acron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile." Explain Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
The scientists have inspired themselves from the geckos legs, covered with microscopic hairs, which enable the animal to ensure a perfect adhesive.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "sleep easily out of the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARCHING ON THE MURS? –"this equipment could be used as a temporary adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that nanocarbon tubes are drivers of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
For the moment, no super hero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a microfibre adhesive, such as hair, which self cleanses dust during the movement on an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicinal products: never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are disaltering and vitamin-rich, if associated with certain vital medicines, alter the absorption that enhances or decreases their effectiveness, depending on the case, with the same serious health consequences.
David Nailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in boxes or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apples juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, which cancel their beneficial effects and endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antistaminal and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
RISCH MEDICINAL PRODUCTS- It is the Italian Medicine Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to under assess the danger resulting from this mixture and to take care of the drinking, if medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone are taken.
NOT THE PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacy of the Public University of Milan, called: "These discoveries are generally reported immediately to the various national and international agencies of medicines that need to change the informational notes of medicines.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert stressed to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel of the Economy at Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Economic Award was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and he is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms of Bush's economy and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that dismantled many polemics, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron's collapse or Worldcom, disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high value economist", but also a very aggressive, particularly critical to the excesses of Bush administration liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open suite of personal productivity that aims to touch ever more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After nearly one year's work, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows to the general public with various innovations: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less ugly interface, to other more important, such as the compatible created for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the next Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to some modules, such as the one that reduces the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, for example, useful to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graph with elements of a sheet or a text developer.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the calculation sheet, various users can intervene, avoid conflicts about changes, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of feedback for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next few weeks they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version is unloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and adds to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent at home or at the workplace.
And if the free-of-charge theme can be a way to spread it into homes, it is just in business that Open Office's suite is trying the great challenge, which can already count on various projects in public administration and schools.
Notwithstanding the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for the equivalent Word writing video; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New positive case for the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the dress of the best climber.
It's the website of the daily L'Équipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, too from Gerolsteiner.
Blood analyses on Kohl's samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter analyses confirm the positiveness of the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positiveness to the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associationed Press, having notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus shaking the peaswear of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NOW YORK TIMES DOES APPLICATION If ITALY IS RACISTA?
Italy "as emigrant countries has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would this transform the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times has been doing on a long article on the subject of racism in Italy, from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "North Paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where more integration and more work are recorded, but also "a strongest anti-immigrants feeling in the country and the most important support for the North Lega"
To confirm the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new Lega legislative period to stop immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is mentioned as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend emphasized by the Pope as well as the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market does not know a crisis
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to exclude the entire categories of young people, the right to study due to the very high overall costs that families of origin need to support- explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand of students has deformed the market so much that a generalized growth process has started for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, non-registrated, unlimited rental contracts, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the review of tax are necessary to calm down prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza zone, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (Band Nere Zone), to an average of 800 (Lambiate Zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria Zone)
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in nearby areas of the University, they need 250/280 euros for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros for one single, 450 for one bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for one single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Only if you get away from the peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed, and 450 euros for one single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a simple one, you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas of Policlinico, Voero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 euros for one single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra community students, are recorded a subsequent abnormality: the rental rate for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, the cities eliminate historical rooms.
Historical cinema rooms close in favour of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director in stage Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the peripheral of large multi-salles, and the death of consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of towns, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
Disappearing, these are often historical and memorable places, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with which we shared a lot of path and so many emotions," observes the director of the Nuovo film Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the sworn of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a provincial room, and nostalgia in a way to live the movie, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: over the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid the most of them: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is in the lead with 82 single-room cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
The evidence confirms that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multisalle cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romania.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," says Anec's president Paolo Protti, "it is useful to build new structures, but it still needs to be guaranteed the survival of those already in existence, because when a farmroom in a city, they are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of credit deliberation for traders: the state's past debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between €16 and €18 million per year is needed.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono-room cinemas in historical and peripheral centres.
Among the proposed normative measures are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and certain parking spaces.
"I like this initiative," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the Bologna example that introduces other measures.
However, it is obvious that, in contrast to the superpower of multiplex, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and teenagerhood, was the tincell that convinced me to make "New Paradiso cinema" which I have been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn on the other side, not to see the black panels by dust.
Links between politics and ‘undrangheta, mayor of Gioia Tauro arrested.
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniformize the choices of the Mayor to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are brought by the magistrates of the Calabria Antimafia Directorate, against the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martello, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The manettes also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administration, and his son-in-law, the boss's homonym, already convicted of the association of mafia-type malfaitors, as well as paying €10 million.
"a confrontation with legal and moral norms, and above all with good sense," the prosecutors wrote, both local authorities expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been granted to the clan - writing the judges - to formally enter the mayors facilitating the, already considerable, possibilities of control and direction of the public administration"
The Chairman of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee Calabrais, does not hide "collections between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who are resisting the pressures of thendrangheta, heroes who are honest."
The arrests this morning follow those of July last, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
As of the end of April last, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to presumed conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their role in administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, had been appointed head of a right centre coalition after the ballot in May 2006.
He cried to the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the Vice-Minister of the Interior at the time, Marco Minniti, who accused him of handling everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the change in the A3 project.
Based on interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm writes, is emerged "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a more famous group, close to Piromalli, harmonizing the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from the waves, the big starts now.
This is an unmatched area that occupies more than 70% of the world's surface area and now the major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, are the new renewable sources on which colossales like Chevron have put their eyes, and now try to put their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price declined around 1980, the idea of using marine energy was put off, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil are making a major increase in the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the global electricity demand could be covered by marine hop operating systems.
This amount would be twice as much as that produced by nuclear power stations.
And in addition, there would be streams and tides..
Colosses on the attack.
The first company to invest on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a real revolutionary step.
With two years of this, more and more applicants among these companies have always been dedicated to traditional energy for marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies- said the spokesperson of a company associated with the US oil coosse, in the economic daylight Wall Street Journal- and it evaluates the possibilities of cooperation with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit délibéred by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who travel on the path of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested up to now, although their details are not known, according to observers, indicate increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are still talking about technology at its beginning, as well as the fact that marine energy does not discard fears of environmental impact.
At present, systems such as Portugal, or some in Scotland, are of small dimension and do not seem to create a major problem to the ecosystem.
However, large-scale energy production requires the use of technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a buoy system connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which makes the sludge move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six marine turbines from the East River of New York.
The water movement at the tides turns the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the permissions required to extract energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves the potential of the tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
