Inflation in Europe has deteriorated on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, said the European Community Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, reports Bloomberg.
Unlike US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the guiding interest rate by saying that the fall in interest rates, with the rise in raw materials prices and the decline in unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we need to discourage" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this issue later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent has been record over the past 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6% to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has started due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Long-term quota for cereals has increased by 88 per cent and the soya price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
Food oil and milk products prices also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 per cent and last month, a black gold barrel cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent over the next 3 to 4 months.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the guiding rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (the Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December, so since 2002, he currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (the Survey Institute) has never previously found such a weak social support, 13 per cent.
For faithful voters, the difference, due to the greatest determination of opposition voters, would represent support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is 2% throughout the population.
On the faithful voters some to go to the vote, the number of supporters of the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the economic situation in the country was particularly serious has never been as high, it is 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent additional, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects an aggravation and only one tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of the surveyed persons, namely a majority never seen in the previous Gallup surveys, found the Prime Minister doing his work rather bad than good.
13 percent of the surveyed have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without change in government.
While 35 per cent of the respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the rebels last October, this rate is currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the surveyed responded that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the surveyed would certainly participate and 15 per cent additional would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be undoubted.
74 per cent of people would say no to registration rights in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation costs and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay costs.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation and hospital stay costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets implanted in Budaörs' commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, unlike the increase in VAT this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Panier also increased by 16 per cent on average, an increase in value significantly more than a thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flew" in the major food stores last December, did not increase brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked by the fact that goods purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Cart in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded 91 forints, at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the prices of turkey net, nuts and poppy increased sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition did not decrease the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the recorded bottle included.
It does not prevent that this year, in terms of daily Panier, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the most expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her daily Cart by 15 per cent, while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 per cent, respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket and the most expensive basket this year, we find a 12 percent difference, while the difference between last year's most expensive and last year's most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forks, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rates has already been noticed in the Christmas prices of last year.
This process made trade confused, hypermarkets could not clearly determine the margin applied to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalcifies the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the level of trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the price increase in the Daily Cart has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was more than 1,630 forints than last year's and the lowest prices also increased by 1,284 forints.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we noticed a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the daily consumer goods prices increased by more than 30 per cent in the hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for certain essential foods, the Institute of Statistics found an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to its daily Cart, this seems almost absurd, since the price level of this product, which was already very expensive last year, has risen by just over 10 per cent from the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to accept the brutal increase in prices by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy in quantity, they take long-contained food by pallets.
Wednesday morning, major queues formed at the tre hypermarkets because the number of customers increased suddenly.
However, according to our information, sales are less important in the province, many multinationals complain from survey companies that they do not even reach the intended sales, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals make savings on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The health conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overcrowding of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the Chief Doctor of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Not long ago a MRSA infection was diagnosed in the János Hospital trauma department.
Antimicrobial resistant bacteria was detected in a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person with a serious car accident came out of the hospital, but shortly after he had to return to the hospital due to a MRSA infection and since then the doctors have not been able to do a major surgery with him because of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multiresistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Monitoring System, says Karolina Böröcz, Chief Doctor of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Knowing that it is the number of infections caused by a multiresistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant to meticilline-oxacilline.
A third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly patients, with small weights or with a weak body.
According to János Hospital Director, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospitals.
Most importantly, we should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only the one or not looking for it," Tibor Nyulasi said.
SA resists antibiotics.
"These sick people are isolated, the caretaker puts rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
At first, hospitalized patients are examined if they carry MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample is not in mode
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be warned, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multiresistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs especially in hospitals and in older people's homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It must be known that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases occur only if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor at the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in ambulatory and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but there are significant shortcomings in hospitals, too, in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemic, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a detectable way or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Governmental project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA is exorbitant expenditure for social security funds, which is why it is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multiresistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Commissioner, author of a deadly accident, was not drunk
The official finding of the death accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the 22nd arrondissement commissioner, who has since resigned from his position, who has crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to drunkenness or dizziness, announced on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relevant finding had been established.
The findings confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police crashed a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he, with his own car, turned in the 22nd arrondissement's Kossuth Lajos street. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing the passage for pedestrians.
(In addition, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute an alleviating circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and asked for his retirement because, according to the police's communication, he was very upset.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Budapest Attorney General.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, on Friday in Budapest, three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties on a loan contract worth EUR 100 million. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers the budget financing of education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties have signed a EUR 50 million contract for innovation, and the state budget will use this envelope primarily in the framework of the research and development project to be implemented at the University of Debrecen.
In the negotiations, draft line 4 of the metro was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss any change to the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans according to the EURIBOR interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of all of Europe is directed to this country of the Balkans which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought on this EU market that is still the cheapest but who will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
At present, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the cheap seafront.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, at the seaside, Albena, the "Gold Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, early or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasingly available to buy in the very cheap area of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the commercial and office surfaces promise the highest rate of amortisation.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus become a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the edge of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are planning to settle buy renovated buildings at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old landed houses at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and generally the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (since last December, Bulgaria has been quoted among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term surplus.
The price of capital buildings is constantly rising due to increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and six per cent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, the meeting of professionals will be completed on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries of the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined in the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are intense discussions on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that, at the moment, they did not wish to discuss accurate figures, but that they were prepared to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent to the 1990 level by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need of such aid, without reducing emissions.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The support fund defined in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Board of Directors consisting of 16 members likely under the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), reported Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Waters, reaffirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as an amiral vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the "After 2012 Agreement", and was ready to reduce them to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatory to the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent, and all 15 EU members of that time took a 8 per cent less commitment.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period from 1985 to 1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be implemented over the period of two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In that case, commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize, which was responsible for addressing climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
The British Army units communicate recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video sharing site with a view to becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who was passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan are loading video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londrès or the landlords load them on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been viewed by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and communicates videos about operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Department (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial goal of the air force, the videos were taken on the net to recruit, and according to the Department of Defence, they were also used to make the real goals of the presence of the army abroad known to the general public.
The propaganda published by this way does not cost anything compared to the usual advertising of recruitment on television, which was communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but also inevitably conveys a political message as it in a special form justifies the soundness of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is obsessed because, apart from carefully compiled and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses, but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Furthermore, many videos had already been made on the net showing the operations areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in real mission, but the British army has only recently been loading these videos.
The Americans make recruitment a little different by using the American's Army shooting game for free. In this game the player can directly replace the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and donuts in departments
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her employees who can say goodbye to 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another department will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and will offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Celebration, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so power changes.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Department of Defence, but it is not the department's employees who will be invited.
At Christmas Orphelins, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, members of the family of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions will be invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the end of the year atmosphere.
Compared to other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees in large, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700 000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forints and the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing bids.
The building of the Theatre of the Gaîte has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have failed to contact the controller.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
That ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: evening dressing was not at all compulsory at this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, is not formally inviting her employees to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
Hundreds of eighty people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat donuts, announced the press service, the party will cost as well as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his employees to take a drink at the Department of Local Authorities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It intends to spend 2,500 forints per guest with a buffet and a drink.
Since János Veres arrived, PM employees celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
No planned party atmosphere, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas celebration will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail where only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, have communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The Ministry of the Environment's press service did not know the award of the official Christmas.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Arts.
The forces of the Mega Strike gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, on Friday, constitute their strike committee, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and the strike will begin on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Cash Act.
This action will certainly cause significant stops in traffic as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV employees (Common Transport Society) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The unions of the League will announce, on Friday afternoon, details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up as a coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period if they are unable to reach agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Cash Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is voted, the strike committees will meet and decide what action to take.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Cash Act will take place only late in the evening or even in the night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, there are important stops in traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and in the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of them is constantly updated on the League site.
Some organizations report to strike for an indefinite period of time, while others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Iron Chemistry) and the Free Trailer Syndicat (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach agreement on minimum services, and more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from service beginning until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. in the morning, the Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions of the League will strike four hours, the Teachers' Syndicat and the Democratic Teachers' Syndicat have called for strike for two hours and from 2 to 8 hours respectively.
The National Medical Association will strike throughout the country in alternance, the Health and Social Sector Employees' Syndicat (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League is that the government should withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new pension calculation method to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a pre-legal retirement guarantee that would allow the system to transfer the functions that it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Union, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning secondary railways and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
According to the Policy Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Moving for Better Hungary), in several ways increases the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", society notes that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations may occur as a result of the exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Zigean and non-Zigean population of Hungary".
The Research Institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy to probably cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the major shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tsigans and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are being strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the Research Institute, with the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular with regard to the confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, as a result of a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "National Self-Defense Association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, in addition, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, i.e. the state," they added.
They reported that everything was done in accordance with the method that, based on the driver of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The focus on civility and association status therefore only serves to avoid the legal traps of registration of these associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk of neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential risk source and the ultranationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-honger policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard Constitution.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the Research Institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, and political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is, for example, similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many Roma disorders that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the source of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
By taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to form a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the past 17 years, the Zigeuners have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had led to vigorous debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own guards as a resistance signals an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the political capital risk warning.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that may have an impact on the change of risk, they inform the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The parties are not uniform in the EU and in the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Days of rest are often linked to religious celebrations or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year ending, and the first day of the new year are also resting days, even more so that the awakeners can rest calmly.
Moreover, in one year, we have 11 red-labelled parties.
March 15 is a national celebration, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as on October 23, which is also the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we celebrate the establishment of our state, 1 May is the work party, and on 1 and 2 November we remember members of our family and of our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious parties that rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in the cases or only one working day left before or after the red-marked holiday.
It is true that we pay the extended weekend price by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has decided in a special regulation on days of replacement of days before or after the parties.
The Act extends to all employers and employees, officials and public service workers.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions turning without interruption and in service, their vocation, and also for rest days.
This year, working days will only be changed around the end of the year's holidays: from December 24, life almost ends throughout the country because, according to the experiences, the majority of people do overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year at their home.
Next year many parties fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be less changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at their home four days afterward.
Saturday 25 April will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday October 18 will be a day of work replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the festivals because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can be horribly troubled by colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that are almost more aggressive to us: these are things that "blower" the daily workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these problems or face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing problems to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," said a colleague.
What did you miss a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them he forgot to pass the message (it is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have difficult explanations, it is useful to consider how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and to make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a desktop tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the sticker on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen you thought lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them otherwise they're right to be angry with you for stealing their good.
Don't bring back envelopes, post-it into your pocket because it may be awkward that there's no more envelopes and you need them right now.
Are you talking about colleagues' privacy?
There are no good means to stop pots that spread.
Who did what with who?
Or and why?
Don't tell everyone your information (subjects) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't miss his trust!
Enter in you the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware.
You're going to be sick without just a reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself ill under the pretext of a shaking headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, remember that your work, your urgent affairs, your end-to-end missions must be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't work or something could happen that would force you to stay at your house, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues to avoid being surprised by your absence the next day.
Refreshment, bridging, phone
You're getting into your job, but the crap of your colleagues gets you out of it brutally?
You've become a witness, unwillingly, of a phone discussion that you'd better have not listened to?
Don't bother your colleagues with fredonations, singings, conversations with a loud voice (which you lead above their head), foot beats, big words or discontents expressed with a loud voice.
They may interfere even if your colleagues are not dug into a project (redaction, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, don't accuse anyone for this forgotten!
Don't put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your lazy colleagues!
Recognise it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented disadvantages for others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they do not fit at the desk!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet the expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We move slowly into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a special melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm raising the sound.
Music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the sounds of the time, then a female choral comes to it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not ruined us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Now it seems that the cap will be different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new mode of the garage rock breaking the guitar, the Hungarian electrotop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he threw himself on his own path, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance and pop music, began to become acquainted when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the wan2 magazine cited their first album in 2002 among the fifty largest discs of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have undoubtedly become trendy, but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted as needed, he released a new and better record.
The recent Cannot Walk Fly Instead album can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line of the former Pécs group of Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the flight reference but beside the air music now appears, depending on the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs at the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, which has recently broadcast popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube makes me ask a question: has your music remained a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Musics called alternatives, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit independently of the language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and the foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: In abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
People go to concerts and not only young people over ten or twenty years, but also the oldest.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music as they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, I'm happy to see that people are coming more and more to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important for concerts or mutual influence is already working, but it is only perceived in the unavoidable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you planning to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made careers in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even if some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust the other's musical presence and let them deploy themselves.
At the beginning, it was quite inevitable that our music was compared to Yonderboi's, because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the mr2 Petõfi palmarès, Wings of Love occupies first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, did you consciously open to a larger layer?
Zs.B.: We do not plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to wear the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes discussed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choral of the gospel genre.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian musical scene.
So the six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, which was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or the girls changed it a little?
Zs.B.: This song existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The subsequent agreement attracted the voice of the song.
I sing the same night the melody the girls learned later.
I almost got it right now and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but certainly we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except a short solo from Judy Jay), they don't have a single role, they all sing together and they don't sing stronger than music, so music doesn't just accompany their songs.
They were behind on the scene too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute solist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little bit about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, you just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted the others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, nothing about the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything was set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "leash" this record.
At the moment, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader perfides billions of risks because of his inferiority complex
A concealer.
Thus, his former employee refers to the French giant General Society, the owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost EUR 5 billion because of it.
However, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and that, in addition, cannot be seen as unable.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized the US mortgage market crisis in time.
"He is fragile," said his superiors who declared him to the police.
However, if we take account of Kerviel's statement by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I had won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," says Kerviel and adds that, of course, he did not keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he failed to file the reports.
He succeeded in duplicating his superiors, although the Eurex scholarship began to be interested in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything has nothing
Was he crazy about being discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought that the simple fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
What's his willingness to risk so much?
He was only gradually able to reach his position.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"Since my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," explains Kerviel.
However, shortly after his entry in office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by investing in the decline in this title during the Londries attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted.
"When I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
But it is then that the start of the year occurs.
He loses one billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to occult the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find it?
He became suspicious because of his leave.
"I took only four days of leave last year.
A trader who doesn't take a vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which in the coming years could bring EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately SEK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Rep. can obtain from these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Rep. was among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (around $1.8 billion).
However, later he was released and lived at home in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this central American state, in function between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be incarcerated again, it is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Aleman regularly transferred the government's money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictive corporations and accounts were actually owned by members of his family and the closest supporters.
Part of this money went into the funds created by Aleman to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted.
That's the way it is.
The State budget was adopted.
Why is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate before the vote on the statement of challenge to the Government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies adopted this law without any problem which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That's a kind of paradox.
Whether or not, each chapter and article constitute the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although ignored behind the competition of power against government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that's why more attention is given to it in the media.
The political disputes are much more interested in the opinion than the sudden figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered three difficulties that the current budget is not suitable for both:
The first is the significant share of the costs of mandates imposed by the law, not only by pensions but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" involving the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first bad.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the government budget deficit that represents the greatest accident.
It is public and relatively controlled.
The real decelerated bomb is the shortage of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often, as a matter of shame, issued bonds, debts disproportionately to their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, except for money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits.
In recent years, they succeeded in repaying these debts by selling in mass the shares of distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only the official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it is noted that:
Our economy has already been through a phase of growth for several years, just like the rest of the world, and ČSSD has been selling it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly in debt to the state.
Other countries, except for some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our Republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly back on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, globally, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes that have, unfortunately, been flooded in vain in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending has been eliminated, approved last year before the elections, if a shift in age limit for retirement and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, all policies will cease to exist in that country and anyone in power will only administer it.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats that mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes the regular costs deferred by the cost of mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not wasted all the money they could.
If we really don't want politics to become simple bureaucratic, we must be patient and allow this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can spend only the equivalent of what it can take from taxes and taxes, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send to auction $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It was the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of Individual States decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote his report to the clients Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts still expect further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is that they really have to understand what can still follow," said the Chief Economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
The Central Banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more expensive loans to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and drop the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after it did not succeed in lowering Londrès interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual loans, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English central banks have declined interest rates several times in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio agency of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will help to conjure the crisis, since it does not address the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the problem of global warming.
This time, the criticism of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, composed of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured in it at all, it is just a rocket of words, replacement of solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President pointed out, when he presented his book, that his subject was of great importance to him, and that is why he was so committed to this matter.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only meet the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climateologist, he nevertheless felt that he had enough provisions to write such a book.
Indeed, he is an academic capable of monitoring and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, in his view, the following theory: the climate is constantly changing, the changes are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, therefore they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he had experience with a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose uncontrolled opinions on others, which he felt was a danger to freedom.
In response to the questions of the present persons, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integral environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and profits they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have left the deadline expiring and have failed to renew their former driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are in the process of issuing a new permit to them before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will take the road.
According to the authorities, their driving licences have not been renewed, especially those who do not want to drive anymore.
While municipalities reported a decline in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital were invaded by applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit increased this week.
The mairie is satisfied with about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issue of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request release within five days.
In this case, the driver shall pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not succeed in completing the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and borrowing the road without a valid licence will be liable for a fine from January.
The guilty person will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will rise to 2500 kronor.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable for a fine.
By doing so, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kronor.
The Department had called on the authorities to be moderated and to impose fines not exceeding SEK 1,000.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
According to him, the driving licence is a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card which, without exceptions, must be valid.
Persons who no longer want to drive should return their driving licence.
Just bring it or send it to the respective municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to renew.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko.A.K., former police officers accused of connivence with the gang of David Berdych, will be thirteen and ten years in prison, respectively.
The Prague High Court thus sentenced them permanently by reducing their penalties by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the Department for the Combating of Organized Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years of imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is only waiting for the first instance judgment.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials of more than 16 years in prison.
He can't receive more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal recognized guilty of participation in holding-ups 19 persons, and the Superior Tribunal today dealt with 16 of them's appeals.
Most of the defendants, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement between them with Berdych, provided criminals with information from police sources, covered the various holding-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 per cent of the larcin in Opava and Ko.
In the accusation it is about the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed robbery, whose victims in most cases have suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power of a public agent and prohibited arms.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally held guns, shells with a steel core, a direct laser shooter or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already declared guilty of other handfights lifted Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived at the court.
The main hearing has prevented, for the moment, Tom★ Půta and Maroš Šulej who currently live in detention in Ireland, where they are waiting for the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The price of the replacement of children: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba wants a compensation of 12 million kronor plus costs from the Třeb ́s hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for the fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the Ondřej Dostál Hospital is absolutely inconsistent with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," said Dostál at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the report of an expert whose drafting has been ordered by the opposing party.
We'll check if this has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," said Dostál.
The amount is expected to be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo.ov family asked for one million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress on various scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been faced with regret that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třeb ́s hospital on December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo.
The Governor of the Vysočina Miloš Region Vystrčil gave, at the end of October, each of the families SEK 100,000 for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the hospital of Třeb.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally forced to provide civil liability insurance.
In the event of failure, they must pull into the reserve base, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
So far, the courts recognized relatively low compensations, and the amounts calculated according to the tables were about hundreds of thousands, exceptionally million.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute concerning the brand Valašské království (Royaume of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed him who had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Thomas Harabiš, the former co-worker of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasite on Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of Valašsko’s Kingdom just refer to everyone this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's a job behind us for almost ten years.
He said to seek money and to develop events.
According to him, the money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasite on our work," he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, Polívka used the title Valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television program.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At that time, however, it had no connection with the project to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making the Valašské Království passports appear.
From an original humorist action, it came out of a profitable business and business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature should be quoted in the passport and even offered to the holders of the balances on the price of his farm's visit and theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž broadcast, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was formed by Harabiš and its team that devoted itself to the project intensively.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who peaked with the statement "of King Boleslav first elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as a mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and its company, requesting that the court have rejected today.
What could make the case clear is the planned tournament for the throne and half the princess.
He should get out of it a new king.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the kings' parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can naturally register," said Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearance of prejudices
In fact, I've never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its working qualities were nothing extraordinarily, the quality of speed change, driving and also of manufacturing could, in many respects, be classified as lower than average.
Now, there is on the market her successor the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
As the combi named SW goes a step further, I have to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the space for the head on the back seats.
While there ends the complaints because the bodywork combined means that even the big devils will be comfortable in this respect.
Let's see how quickly it's done.
I'm going to talk very quickly about the inside so that I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a nearly successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems poor.
Here, I would have liked a bit more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain of seats or too short files is over.
Side guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As far as space is concerned, the increase in body size is also sensitive.
The combi sees also disappearing the lack of space above the already mentioned head.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing on this vehicle is, therefore, its luggage boot.
I have to assess this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear spinning ice) and a rather easy grip.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not invasive and can be extended while being able to hold heavy enough objects.
But let's stop the volume.
According to the tables, it makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is rather average compared to competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
Compared with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, the Peugeot remains very much behind, with the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a pusher, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to show the benefits, I would mention the remainder of the box after the reverse of the back seat files perfectly right, or a very low foot foot.
120 horses distributed over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should look like a 1,6 who makes a family haschback.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot stuck by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic of it.
Browse the Prices
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, one must be aware that a rather well equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto engine of 1.4 litres up to 329 900 Kč is still possible.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
However, we have arranged in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic washing glasses, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar figure.
So it is only left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is bad
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concerns among the remainder about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently confronted with a series of obstacles.
British schools even notice cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of native residents turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the ongoing conflicts between the opponents and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to increase, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and fights between students have translated into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with a iron bar.
The guilty defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him by racist speeches.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant conducted by two teenagers.
The young girls allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and had thrown stones.
"When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and began to scratch on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then discovered his ass," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went up to qualify conflicts with immigrants as fighting for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between native and immigrant residents begins to be tended.
Seventy thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or then a quiet sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you pizza, ice cream or drunk cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list in its entirety, but enriched.
There is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye ever saw.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the very beginning of the 20's.
Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, made it build, because all that was a crime in the United States (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, random games, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings pushed and cars, belonging to the culte symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and the American politicians left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the Nacional Hotel Bar, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail with your choice.
And these cult cars are still running in Havana, since the formerly imported jigoulis and fiat have for a long time, in such a salty and wet climate, ruined.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decayed, nowhere else around there are so many magnificent colonial monuments that there are just there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development is green.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have pushed not only to Havana, but above all to Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and will be especially appreciated by amateurs of small trains.
The cane was returned from extensive plantations in the sugarries on a narrow path by small steam and engine trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for dozens of years, and this is how you can see small locomotives where contemporary people are not only in museums elsewhere.
Where to guide his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vi.ales, west of the island, is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
Exuberant vegetation is growing on a limestone soil.
Mogots, calcary balloons and rocks rise in candles from the bottom of the valley, and with fertile soil in their inners, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably grown of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the Havana Cigars factory.
Somebody might also find interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was turned.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the trade in slaves and sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth has embodied itself in the beauty and the window-sized character of this small-scale city.
Coloniální španělská arkitektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějʹmi francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí témʹ nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous massif Escambray, is a place so far away that in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay off the side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't destroy anything either, everyone was just having a roof over the head.
If there is more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth visiting interesting places around, such as the Playa Ancón Beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is custom to go to the Casa de la Música which animates after sunset and where music sleeps only in the small morning.
Baracoa
Some call this bourgade located in the extreme east of Cuba the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way it leads.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and accidental mountains and pass through a almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the Eastern Collection of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the outskirts of Colomb) and from the hill where the old castle and the current El Castillo hotel are held, there are several tables, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the mountainous massif Sierra Maestra, the Baie of Sows and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the holy patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled in a number of pages.
Only, as we just say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, states Americans
The lack of military and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should develop a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan does not take place as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland with the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the increasing challenge of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States has called NATO troops this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates for greater activity, Great Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan Government and the strengthening of development aid.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only form part of the solution.
The other one is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said the British Minister of Defense, BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. army, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the province of Helmand, located in the southern part of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, nearly one quarter in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they request other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop today made similar comments.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about eighty percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that is not enough," said De Hoop to the Reuters agency at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there has also been a conflict between the countries involved in the issue of whether all all allys in Afghanistan do their utmost.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passiveness.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun has described German soldiers as fake this week.
"The discovered Afghan fakes: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British team during a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The debt burden of the State exceeding SEK 84,000 is the responsibility of each Czech Republic.
The total debt rose to SEK 842,7 billion at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
Thanks to a better than expected state budget savings, the Department has reduced the estimated amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose to SEK 842,7 billion at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year it thus increased by 40.2 billion kronor.
However, as of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion kronor.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its government debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding SEK 84,000 is the responsibility of each Czech Republic.
Over the last year, the government debted more than 111 billion kronor.
"For the moment, it appears that, thanks to a lesser deficit planned for next year, one billion crowns could only be exceeded in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion kronor," said Patria Finance David Marek's analyst for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance Analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in the year 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If the situation on the political scene appeared to change, policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he explained.
Debts Growing
The government's debt is made up of central government debts and is mainly generated by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government's debt is financed by Treasury bills, interest securities, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The government's domestic debt has risen this year from 38,5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
The government's external debt has risen this year from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123,3 billion.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached SEK 803,3 billion at the end of September and from June it decreased by SEK 13.7 billion.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which is far too high in view of the current health of the economy.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the interest rates where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand this indicates that there will be a need to negotiate when pension reform comes," commented the Pikora data.
Better than we were expecting
As a result, the government had planned to borrow SEK 159.2 billion this year from the government's financing and debt management strategy for 2007.
At the beginning of September, however, due to changes in the savings of the State budget better than expected, the Department reduced the estimated amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The sum is essentially the government budget deficit, which clearly will reach SEK 76 billion this year, instead of the initially planned SEK 91.3 billion.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidating Agency, i.e. SEK 13.3 billion, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of State interest securities for SEK 43 billion and the reimbursement of loans from the European Investment Bank to SEK 1.8 billion.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum for appointing a bully bear
The British teacher sentenced in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court at 15 days of prison and expulsion, said his lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students between the ages of 6 and 7 who gave the name of Mahomet to a bully bear while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punishable by a whispering sentence.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School of Khartoum in the Sudan, was arrested at her home Sunday and accused of offending Islam and sedition, pursuant to section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, the story dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class beer.
"Hut names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says Robert Boulos, director of the school.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as a preferred forename.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, teaching in the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked children to vote for a name," he said it was only a "unintelligent error".
Opinions shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very careful to her students" and "which never speaks of religion in class".
Let us remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most named name in Great Britain, he writes 14 different ways of English.
This forename often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy for example?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last meeting of negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and ultimate discussion meeting in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without having been able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," said the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to safeguard peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence immediately but we are entering in a very difficult period," he added, meaning that "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which bring together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province populated at 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika was in charge of a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that target date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of Tunisian administration of Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina expresses its willingness to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide for it.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unhappyly, no agreement has been reached," announced the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where these "last chance negotiations" have changed since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations".
Domino effect
The Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrad says, inter alia, to fear a "dominant effect" in a region that is still fragile by the 1990s' wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end as they started: at the Security Council."
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that “the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be “in consultation” with the West.
Bush terminates an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to engage immediately in negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a "treat of peace" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities, said Bush, reminding both parties of their obligations with regard to the "roadmap" for peace they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, chaired by Abbas, would aim “to conclude a peace treaty solving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues”.
This designation covers the three spicy problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees exiled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be "global and comprehensive" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert has committed himself to the "direct and continuous" of future talks and to "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the time limit for the implementation of its "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had reached a commitment in this respect by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the source of a plan, enclosed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saoud in his interview with Saudi capital Arabic daily.
For the attorney, police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
As always in this type of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate General Investigation (IGPN), a police car was running on Sunday, shortly after 5:00, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and was running at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “unauthorized, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road” (read below) and led by two young people without helmets, was circulating “with a very strong turn”.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a priority refusal on the right," says a police officer.
The control of alcoholicity on the occupants of the vehicle has proved to be negative.
The state of the car (before detonated, stared windscreen, cut-off shock walls) testifies to the violence of shock.
Yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGC, co-saying with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the Attorney-General stated that the NPI's investigation at this stage disregarded the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday evening, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of rage, probably caused by the cracking of the footwear on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained overcrowded the time the police car was able to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which police would have left the place very quickly, thus not lending help to both young people.
The NPI, while remaining cautious, would also ‘all serious faults’ on this point.
"This is an aspect of the more difficult investigation, which requires more investigation, which needs to be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows showing exactly on the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revitalize them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a completely hagard policeman, who was drinking.
Two others tried to revive one of the young, the fourth talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, with the certainty that the people present in the hopeless situation of young people have had, police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived on the spot.
According to this witness, relief came “approximately twenty minutes after the police left”.
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that the police services have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," said the prosecutor.
The tension rises to Pakistan
The Pakistani police have suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against emergency measures were injured by the lacrymogen grenades used by the law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
These were retreated by stone throws, hurting police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several of them would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the lawyers at the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (Centre) and Peshawar (Northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful alliance Buthida Majlis-e-Amal whose president ''re urging the people to send flowers to judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and detritions to those who have sworn before Musharraf'''.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer holds'''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly referred to by the exceptional measure declared on Saturday night.
She was to take a decision in the next few days on the legality of the presidential re-election on 6 October, in the indirect vote of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was evaded and replaced.
'Everything we're seeing is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court', said the judge to the newspaper The News.
The promise by Pervez Musharraf to leave the army head and become a civil president 'no longer' after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani Government denounced insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his Deputy Head of Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnancy remains unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one out of three (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
The various contraceptive methods such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed a better 'fertility control', according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Calculated in the nearest month for a couple of five and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on space station
It would have taken more than seven hours to work in space with astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, essential for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky release that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the astronaut's "bricked" tools to make repairs.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had unloaded Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room to welcome European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a kind of appliance for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module by solar panels, already present on the ISS, to position it at its final position.
After moving it, the crew started the re-deployment of the module's solar panels with a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which depicts as buckets, was damaged about one metre by a cable that was stuck.
The deployment was stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to perform a Discovery shuttle control exit and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotating system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to caracolate at the end of the 30 meters length of the remotely controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to do the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" in the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very good, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore responsible for "operating" the "infected" solar panel.
After precisely having inspected the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed kinds of "rails" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" staying near the saddle and, inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-insulating hockey channel to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing hundreds of volts, was designed and "bricolated" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning to the station's interior.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned the Discovery shuttle for a scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in Stock Exchange
EADS is currently falling sharply on the Paris Fellowship, after the Air and Defense Group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 as a result of the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of tackling the delay in delivering its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion for Airbus', announced the parent house of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without any more numerical details.
The group also notes that the estimate of the new costs is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the delays of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday, when the Urnes get out: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their desire for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of the parliamentary elections, Russian president Vladimir Putin today sends a television message to the voters on public channels, which is already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does it as a united Russia's leader, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is becoming overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President did not leave anything clear by receiving foreign ambassadors, simply giving a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish for honest, most transparent and open elections, without aggressive elections," he added.
In the opposition's view, we are far from the account.
She denounces a campaign of pressure.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that "there has never been such a dirty election, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of last weekend demonstrations, the former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains forbidden to visit according to her lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the homo sovieticus"
Behind these unrestricted legislation, there are two much more open issues:
- Who will succeed in Putin's presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the presidential first round, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot break a third consecutive mandate.
And no successors come up.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the ever-powered Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
Anyway, both the legislative and the presidential authorities will triumph over the outgoing power.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the sovjeticus homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg, went further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutin renewed with the model of a paternalist state, fully accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic readiness," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "resign fully to personal responsibility" which they had shown shortly after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What do you think about?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of the united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “What should we think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the destiny of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents stored on 27 km linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. in an individual and nominative manner, at the request of an old victim or of his rights.
The eleven States responsible for their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICCR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, objected to the openness of these nominative documents to the public due to the sensitivity of certain information.
Like supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to retrieve civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if necessary, to provide evidence of internally, in order to open the way for compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, over 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Dr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches nearly €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light to the European Commission last April to launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will disturb the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and "10 billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, Head of the European Commission Delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England notes concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday that it was concerned to alleviate the present return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer of duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its planned reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation of five weeks," she states in a communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time the BoE seems to put liquidity on the market at five weeks in an open market transaction.
These are usually done at one week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it "wills to take other measures to maintain interbank loans rates" on the day on the web with its base rate.
The interbank rate on the day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, one higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a high rate of penalty that had discouraged banks from using it.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the book price compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC reject review of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power on Thursday, which corresponds to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist 'nich' (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the recovery of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the management of rents.
As UMP and NC had voted against the review of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was lifted after the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes vivid, between majority and opposition at a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Members Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the full of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending Financial Act discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming up
Following numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Festival Republic Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival should be held from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the Reading Festival bar in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
As Glastonbury was the most inspiring event he ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 said that his company and Melvin Benn's company were working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in discussions with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been involved in politics because of the current administration," says Charlie Jones.
"Happyly, we have been able to talk with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents raised the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after demarking in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a field festival, while ours are rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge the two formulas in one way or another to give the American both an impression of the European and urban field festival."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hosting capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were launched to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of pressing.
"Vineland will have rock taste, but music will be varied in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal confronts the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film plates to Montreal when no one but Terminator is opposed to it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the “Governator”?
"We need to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best," he said.
The Festival Race
However, Denis Turcotte's priority for the moment is the promotion of the cinema from here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be at all festivals on the West Coast, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or in San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and make sure that the directors make interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock exchange? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
At less than five weeks from the end of the year, investors are already shaking their hands in the hope of the arrival of the traditional rally at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not as sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the December month on the stock exchange generally has a positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively on the basis of statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainties concern markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not in favour of the stipendy taking stimulus over the last few weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is feeding through the existence of liquidity, willing to invest because of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leakage effect to quality values both in the long periods and in the short periods".
To this end, they believe that the scholarship will have a rather lateral, not volatility-free behaviour "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in the Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"This is not the best thing," the expert says.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8, when the index ended at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney Analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert's nuance that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitutional Day (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused based on information from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum layers.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include the two major banks and a few manufacturers in the portfolio "because when the date is approaching, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco ensures that the increases will be due to the bank and industry.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they start.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cycling consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so as well, although in this case there is little representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions the month of December has been a messy month.
The authentic rally of the end of the year took place in 2003, during which stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the perceiving of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, in December an increase of 6.68 per cent was recorded.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (at the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and whether it succeeds in computering at its end-year rally.
The Populaire Bank will open 200 open offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group that decided to start bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30.
Another group that has also repeated several times that he would like to enhance the schedules of his branches, BBVA, even if he has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely the aim of the People's Bank.
Attach self-employed customers in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops selected to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies established throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but renovating existing agencies.
To this end, the organization will modernize its branches already in commercial areas by adapting them to the customer profile of the various streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colours.
The bank business manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve major investments, but staff hire, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The Murillo Brave Streets, O'Donnell Streets and the Gran Vía Streets of Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently successful, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the word of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very additional schedules, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," said Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in stock of its rival Antena 3
We've got it.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a delegate adviser of Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
He said that a single aspect was joyful: 'What hurts me, it is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have lowered'.
However, he emphasised the fact that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less '.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain has stabilized its loss at 15.66 per cent over a year.
The value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % of capital) and announced by Vocento (13 % more) thus reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
His rival Antena 3, who surrendered 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a decrease of 40,5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
In the case of Sogecable, the value of the other co-munition companies listed in Stock Exchange is 3.571 million; 2.518.53 million in Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we profit from it in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as told Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order to ensure that this information is real, the television channel is expected to record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing for the current year compared to 965.4 million of the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while television's net revenue increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point to Telecinco's best relative development in Stock Exchange is the significant payout he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
" We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy to those we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is now giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its revenue on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and to 7% in 2009.
This was due to the expected growth of income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced the projection of Antenne 3 gains to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
The company Ibersecurities recommends buying both values based mainly on its significant profitability of dividends and its long-term sustainable potential.
2.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antenna 3 (maintaining) for ' multiple attractions ' and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: it recommends that the two cases be examined as it has had 'like threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approved the implementation of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
At the same time as its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by parliamentarians and senators to negotiate and agree the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations to ensure the effective functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Values Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets when it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Values Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading and order internationalization systems, which are front of competition to current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms, and requires them to keep a register of all operations they carry out, in order to facilitate the control by the NMCV.
Through the Congress's Economic Commission, several changes have been added, one of which shows that titrated debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proved to be with the debt of American high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they benefited from the implementation of the management has benefited from delimiting legally the functions that graduates in the economy may have 30 years after approval in 1977, the Royal Decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman, which will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNMV, and which will be able to provide its product marketing and attraction services to new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used by Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet of price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat's and the European Central Bank's (ECB's) policy by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data to be disclosed on December 14.
"CIP will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-chairman and Minister of Economics, Pedro Solbes, said that the increase of 4.1 per cent in CPI in November was a "temporary" figure, but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue to be "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes explained in the Congress corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of about 4%," the Minister of Economics recognized in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42.000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen to more than 50% to GBP 12,000 million (€ 16,800 million) since it came into crisis in mid-September and had to use an emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At this time, he was launching some record deposits above GBP 25 000 million, a figure that is gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to grab around a quarter of the British banks' revenues that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18,000 million pounds to reach the 30,000 million target.
The Magnat Group Richard Branson, known for his publicity campaign in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (approximately EUR 70 million) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the offer of Virgin's association, with three other companies participating, including its favorite to save him from the bank route.
Totana mayor was arrested for a presumed urban corruption frame
Today, early in the morning, the Civil Guard arrested the current Mayor of the Murca Municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption frame discovered this week.
ADe plus, one of the municipal council secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, current right-wing member, and until then municipal councillor of the mayor, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council and the possibility of further arrests is not removed within the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of urban corruption tram, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the MEP 'the People' Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession regarding the tram.
Furthermore, according to sources of the investigation, the investigation is the subject of the alleged incubation of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a builder company in Galicia to requalifie 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidate for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the leader of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus, the Spanish Socialist Party organization secretary José Blanco and Bono themselves announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive has justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made public on November 15, his decision not to attend the next general elections and to abandon his political career to focus on the fight against climate change in the university framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he should return to the political frontier since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the Vice-President of the Economy if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the President of the Congress in a "Act of Transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not a house of insult or scream" and to "it is increasingly like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sad that the only local place in Madrid where you cannot speak quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "he knows how to do" and he did not want to pretend that he already occupied his position in order not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subjected to merciless persecution, both the scepticists of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government such as Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has made a decisive contribution to ensuring that Spain is the leader of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must explain clearly to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits citizens will have to change, what individual and collective energy savings we will have to do, what economic consequences will this have?
That is, which will sacrifice itself and pay to save the planet.
But there has not been and there will be no explanations.
Exactly because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, actual measures, are impopular.
Costable, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of businesses and individuals.
Up to the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party, he seemed literally so dangerous in Zapatero that he escalated to deny it.
That is, it's about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have the impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that do not speak, do not deny and do not require, embellize meetings and inspire tenderness.
Hope that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim that we are on a bicycle or that we refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and Chief of Totana Local Police arrested for a presumed tram of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the mayor and a suspect hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have informed the sources of the investigation today.
The municipal adviser was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where many of the staff have gathered, who have also presented themselves to the Urban Municipal Advisorship and the Municipal Management Company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three judgments were added to the six judgments taken last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in a requalification operation of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician Nuaria company could build 4,000 dwellings, following the payment of illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are included in the judicial investigation, which the Totanan Tribunal has instructed number 1.
The first six detainees have now been brought to justice.
According to the sources, the previous Municipal Advisor of Totana and currently Autonomous Parliamentary Adviser of the PP Party, Juan Morales, is subject to the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcie.
The director and owner of Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Nuaria Group agency, and through which the wine pots would have been achieved.
The investigation was carried out by the Urban Delit Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which were carried out in companies related to prisoners and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas, Madrid, and Toana.
Thus, one person was arrested in Totana, in total, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have played the intermediary role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex of the wally municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 accommodations, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been requalified and its project would require a doubling of the population of the municipality, which currently has 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is composed of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are responsible for real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo's parking in Coruña streets, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which is responsible for direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment published yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (PISA headline above the educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of the book of Blackburn:
"The content of the Philosophy course has implied public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela School.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called for teachers to take a critical attitude towards Platon on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in High Schools. "

A colleague passes information on the introduction in the Penal Code of Crimes on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal offence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight in a CD store for a value less than EUR 400 is considered only as an error (Article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed on the download (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic in compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the traffic in CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a film under section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornography material to minors (article 186).
In the end, if my colleague is in the real, someone's exaggerating.

My treating doctor told me one of his articles on strange research titled: ' Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings of monthly pay for workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: "The highest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
Researchers observed that when both people thought they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecution of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing the Balkan war criminals for eight years since the public ministry of the Penal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla will have bitter taste, because the chief perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - are still in freedom, ex-General Ratko Mladic and ex-leader Serbosnio Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are in this list, the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach taking its title, 'the list of Carla' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York who pursues the fugitive criminals and puts pressure on the governments involved to reduce the circle.
What assurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of potential damage, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, anticipation of the driving licence, the civil condition, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among other things.
To have a car is the main one.
It is that, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choosing the proper car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of damage.
The premium is the insurance price, which is based on various factors such as age, sex, antennaity of the driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured, or use of the vehicle, among other things.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
For this reason, people over 25 years of age and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of harm from caution to caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing frequency the probability increases.
They are many of the variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver has to study the situation well in order to choose the vehicle insurance that is best suited to his profile.
Here we will present the most significant variables at the time of choosing one type of insurance, so that the insurance company, in addition to adapting to the insurer's characteristics, will offer him a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age have to face various disadvantages when entering an insurance contract at an accessible price, as may be the low experience in driving and driving licences.
Although the ideal to be insured is an insurance at any risk, there are other more economical options.
The most foreseeable drivers can opt for any risk insurance with franchise, so that they obtain insurance cover at any risk but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the amount of the damage.
"The part of the amount of damage that the customer will pay will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be low," says Luis Noguera, the manager in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance agent.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection to deal with damage caused to third-party, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, you try to be careful and avoid damage as far as possible, as this will affect the benefit, which may reduce the insurance price in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction in the company's basic tariff.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company had a good year, it could afford to increase bonuses," clarified Noguera.
Beyond 25 years, this becomes easier for drivers when entering into an insurance contract, as the damage rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is preferable to choose a risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally, young people cannot benefit from the experience gained in advance after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'peace of novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk as soon as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as persons with the lowest rate of damage, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an insurance at any risk with franchise (may be 300 euros), or an extended insurance to third parties from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of benefit.
"They have a more relaxed conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises," says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, an insurance at any risk with franchise is preferable (i.e. 150 euros), or an extended insurance to third parties when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible damages, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is essential for us to study the insurance that is most appropriate to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to arrive at the eighth finals
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow meet next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, since it serves Italians to be the first and Scottish to rank themselves.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero game in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass before him.
These two D Group games will be playing a week before the sixth day ends, since Milan AC will have to fight the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13th of this month in search of a place for the final of 16th December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero game at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to win out, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would remain the first and make a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat from Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank itself if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able to computer only on that because with nine points the games return to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
For example, the Milaans will try to poison the evening to the Scotts, who have a good hope to rank for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case the Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth finals in order to continue the League of UEFA Champions.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is last and without any chance to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend Vancouver at the first Spice Girls Tour concert
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the Vancouver GM Place Stadium that the group meeting was "brilliant".
About 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the history of the group that was angry at the end of 1990 is told.
The meeting and the world tour coincides with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, ' Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls were set up on stage by showing the bracelets that 'Posh Spice's wife had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the public who filled the GM Place, although Victoria had banned it a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "has not seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
" Sporty Spice " which was part of the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which caused the disintegration of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feeling changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm on the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "the things have been arranged and that we appreciate each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girl's last appearance in 1998.
To begin, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special aircraft from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They count on her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be held in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine casts the alarm.
A dispute on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E) are transported by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases fuel costs, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a shift between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow arises after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian ownership monopoly company providing gas, have tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as expected, its prices to Ukraine having agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would include a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most gas passes," announced the Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters Press Office.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) through Ukraine"
The last major exchange between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies for Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to the decline in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health must 'control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its extra community employees to check whether they have precedents of criminals, said the Supervisory Committee.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed his concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health had no specific information on the number of people employed in the country.
However, his report highlighted other decisive checks that were properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General has carried out extra community checks following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after having darkened with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks of previous criminals, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside the UK.
Among the many warnings, the report of the Auditor General now states that the committees are required to confront the Office for the Control of Precedent Penal Precedents, thus enabling employers to carry out checks on various countries.
"While we have discovered that some staff information has been verified, this is not done every time."
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carried out most of the pre-use checks he would do, but he added: "Our report also highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said that it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-use controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that pre-use controls are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1161 people from the overseas region, most of which are doctors and nurses.
But the general reviewer stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems related to the identification of staff with indefinite contracts, which could or may not be chosen, to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for health authorities' inspections in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lancshire and Lothian are perfectly appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its pre-use control policy and system for staff outside the sea of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was enthusiastic about this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Government of Scotland allies with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of recently updated pre-use controls, valid for all employees, including overseas people.

Ray Winstone, renowned for his coriace character interpretations, won the Richard Harris prize for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has filmed films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Cristal Crane.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award called in honour of Star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me to have access to cinema," he said.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admirative to this great current actor, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas", are awarded by a jury composed of performers, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia reported yesterday to have arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells maniaging an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks against ecclesiastic and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the missile smuggler cells.
Al Qaeda's sympathizers have launched a campaign against the Allied Monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight activists, headed by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, reported the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a 35,000-military group to protect sites, following a failure of Al Qaida in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior said that 18 of the arrested persons belonged to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the activists planned the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the prisoners seem to have complicated the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The Government requested the clergymen to do more against the Saudis headed in Iraq, to join the activists of Al-Qaida fighting the Allied Forces and against the Muslim government allied in the United States, considered as heroic according to the tough line of Sunny Saudis.
Al-Qaida activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have worked with the authorities to support the royal family policy that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by the appeals against the Government of Saudi Arabia, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Saudi Al-Qaida, focused on foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces during the last five... months," said the speaker of the Minister of the Interior on state television.
Of the prisoners, 16 members of the Medina are organized in a "media cell" aimed at promoting "tafiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidising activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European ship in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been living.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the air erosion due to solar radiation associated with slower rotation led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is destroyed by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface that is warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
The professor of the Oxford University Department of Physics, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, even with a living surface."
Uranium enriched by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovakia and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that this was good uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480.000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said not to be a candidate for the presidency, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican candidates for the Presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate of You Tube, during which many ordinary voters who registered their questions submitted them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that of another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the democrats their position in relation to the global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected many of the conditions of the Republican party, who is candidate for the next elections.
We do not know on which criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube's clips to show candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest one-to-one-the-the-me, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The Board of Directors recorded increases in approval when candidates expressed grossly.
The hardest and longest exchange in the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who was head of the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his mandate as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
Both fighters became particularly disgusting when asked whether they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (to provide illegals with regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in deepening this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, because they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, linked to the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears for the outside world, encourages the Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between the liberators and the Catholic Conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether to put water in the nose should be regarded as torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in a pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he started laughing and said that Jesus was too chic to be presented to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
The rise of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent wonderful research of grants carried out by the Liberal Ron Paul, and the squirrels during the Wednesday debate.
Both of them emerged from nowhere, due to the fact that the two party protectors are unable to reach agreement to decide who is the more known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party in a convincing and timely manner through a success message on the American size approaching the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to fall; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra-successful marital foot finger.
But now a revelation confirms that a rich businessman would have hidden his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), for four years, under false names, that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister stepped back in his election project, insulting stupidly the British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the horrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the edge of crack, has demonstrated a shortfall in the guidelines and a poor judgement in case of emergency.
Inappropriate proposals for the change of the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative amount.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions in military spending: they announced that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of silly donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labourists (and his ex-Chief of Vigilance) had to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, Governments can arrive at a point where it would be impossible to rule.
People do not love politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister can't improve things, nor even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the cabinets of ministers are reviewing; the press is searching for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, contrary to other political leaders, he cannot vow to be a beginner.
Although he wished to resign Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's calamity, such as the long investigation into the funds of the party ' money for the members of the House of Lords', the voters might think the opposite.
But Mr Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic as she looks like it.
The cafes are not so monstrous as the members of the Tories party make it believe.
Like Mr. Bean, there is no victim or fraud.
And the cure, although painful, could be to conceive the stalinian trends of Mr. Brown from time to time, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special person, who compares his donations with charity, said that he would not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of the major subsidiaries of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated to be aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be interviewed, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had talked about suspicious donations in October.
But until now Mr. Brown is not involved: nothing suggests that he has been aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half.
He quickly condemned the legislative failure of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something that he knows well, using an investigation committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been smuggled, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president for the Independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the funding of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to work with the Tories, which could lead him to renounce his particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a supporter Mr. Brown.
But he should face some supportive facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and solid skills.
Card fraud.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see wings swinging around.
Now that the US real estate market is undergoing a critical phase, the predators are targeting the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the infection extends from mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in cost and insolvency rates, which measure the share of the non-recoverable balance sheet or which are more than 30 days after that.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in credit to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in the United States in 2005 concerning the personal bankruptcy caused a sudden fall in bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the terms of borrowing were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt sum that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in credit card capital security is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers might prefer to increase their debts now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the cash flow rather than to the value of the heritage, and therefore the decline in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even provide benefits to credit securities issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; consequently credit card debt would become a priority to repay the total.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgagers and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We will not wake up one morning and reassess all the loans." said Gary Perlin, Director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decrease.
If lower real estate prices and a decline in the credit market lead America to the recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Be careful with the backskins..
The British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to testify their roles in relation to fraud committed by the previous financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges for alleged collusory fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should come to the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Great Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges imposed on them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government investigation in Enron's debase.
The charges against the bankers, named the "three of Natwest", declared to have come to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron partner, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him trick the bank road procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary to be zero, but in fact the three British people already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the subsidiary bank for £ 1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accused, Fastow had falsely announced to Enron that the energy company had $20 million to pay Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth, these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to charges, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12,3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty of his active role in two conspiracys in the Debascle of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow lasts a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is detained for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released as a result of the payment of a $1 million bail each, which obliges them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, on the road in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its sloppy speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of redundancies, over $60 billion of market value loss and over $2 billion of loss for pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former president Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were vain because of her death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither under, nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Although no one really needs so many seats as it is more than a family-used aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, a four-day consumer incentive orgy, which is located in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to raise the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from acajou yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer screamed a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"it's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Through a boom of oil, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior student of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at the University of Harvard."
For example, the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest publishers.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires, totalling $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty threshold).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jewelry.
She attended the salon for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Jewelier Group of Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the salon, Sunday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who grasped her high sewing dress like a veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems to focus on the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to make the queue in the locks to come to an enormous warehouse where the Cadillac Escalades are exposed, platinum canvases, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund bulb bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal Delf Dutch porcelain factory, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
"it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bubbling"
In fact, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too high according to Russian standards) have already switched from sparkling logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the fair.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emittents of millionaires or tourists, are arranging the exhibition every day.
And some buy even.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil beds, declared that he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere and cotton incrusted with gold wire.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the Sales Director of A1 motorcycle, a company that has equipped cars with last-shout alarm systems, also declared to have sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said that he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be crushed with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The four set costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of straw leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tyres," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in the prices of real estate here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if it was not in cash," he said.
"there is more than you might think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has built four stands representing British phone cabins, filled with mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionary Fair.
Passengers arrested for launching lots of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobiles, in the middle of this false wealth or a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr.Karyev.
Non-agreed surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrived.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities then learned that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, residing at the 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they expect confidence, the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should solve this mysterious death that has attracted the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, a great worker and enthusiastic," McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-police officer in Newark who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she left two sons of 14 and 11 years of age, as well as a granddaughter.
Eileen Walsj, speaking of the Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they arrived at her house around 3 p.m.
And found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm if Ms. Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
The investigators seek to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door from Miss Castro where a faned rosier rests in the narrow cemetery ahead, and a Dalmatian at the back.
A blue box called "Ethy Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in kitchen and for fragrances, was laid in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two all-ground bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo was extremely valuable, helping her to navigate into the new city and to abandon her political culture.
"she said "you must pay attention to this," he said.
"she was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the strengthening of the global scholarship.
The shares are exploded from both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down the credit conditions, later reducing the interest rates promoted by the relieving statements of the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
Stock exchange markets explode in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the agitated financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence has partially “inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence should persist, it would increase the likelihood of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the US markets, and that later reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news about the US economy, such as the largest decline in real estate sales for October.
The reversal of this financial tumult has been intensified as a result of the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, stating that it will release 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for heavy losses due to the loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are provided in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, of which 2.55% concluded to 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, increased by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index reached 165,5 points, or 2.7%, reaching 6306.2 and adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Previously, the recurrence of credit difficulties in the markets has been highlighted as a result of the strong demand for a monthly auction of three-monthly funds from the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject outward funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions, have caused the "Libor" monthly three-monthly borrowing rates to British banks, their highest growth since last September, to 6.59% after a strong rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal to judgement in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the 6th beater for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris's office, the President General Director of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
Whoever will not be able to win backsard No. 6 will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes because of lack of chance more than because of lack of accountability.
There is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because at the end the judgement remains subjective.
Is the right time to make Bopara grow up?
Is that just in relation to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new managers who have obtained good degrees, professional, should be promoted; but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cracker unless at least one chance is given?
Figures have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cracker must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a beater must be lucky to touch the cracker of one day.
But catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed sure to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 towers to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their time of glory at the highest level and hope to offer.
If it's Shah or Bopara who plays in the Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it doesn't make much difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and succeeded well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also fought to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricketmaker of the test, and this despite the fact that his double cent marked against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session in Asgiriya, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, its brilliant and considerable start at the innings of the 88 in Bombay Test, 32 cents of first class versus six for Bopara, who is 22 years old, and its excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten tours during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his city of Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he overdrew when he recently captized on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor from England.
He only postponed minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his partner who looked at him far, to ask him if he had seen that?
Bopara is far from the best beater, his smoothness allows him to do services that go to him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing a just man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the true art of selection?
I would be pleased to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he would play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work and fight Al Qaida.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, deporting these exiles without money or without visa renewals, or others who hoped that the city would have restored normality.
Some have returned to fight against the activists who have removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in bus convoys of dozens of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and seeing that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastic activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has imposed his men to leave for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqi people from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States militia helped, allowed to hunt Al Qaida from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he encouraged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaida.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I come home today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say that they have attracted the increasing aggression of the capital since the arrival of the U.S. troops, and the prospect of continuing training of well-armed "groups of citizens involved" and working with U.S. soldiers to defend their neighbours.
But others say that they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decade of Damascus' capital, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have escaped the past few years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion that everyone felt about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, had asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have escaped from the country because of the sectary squads of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give visas to Iraqi people, to force them to return to Iraq," said Sunni, retired.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decline in violence can be explained in part by the fact that Sunnis has been hunted from Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will again increase sectary tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated State is conducting vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarreans, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-riding, posts for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Sarre, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This reflects the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools than average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system," said Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people get their degree in a professional school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
Given the number of people, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of the Sahraism has forced schools higher than a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of childcare is free of law - a model that other federal states also copy.
Only future comparison studies will show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And in spite of the sarshes, foreign language knowledge is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise one could gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high school - even though the sarshes are not French.
Chávez rules the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be tic-tac different from in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring the half-hour chronometer back to the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela communicated, as a result of a new law, the watches will be fixed at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets an hourly zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of hours in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, because of a hostage case.
The left nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained President of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with the Head of State or with the Colombian government.
"I can't, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the petroleum country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw in Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "crawled to the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain Chávez is also in all mouths.
A new cell phone call is annoying in the country: "Por queé no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by King Juan Carlos of Spain who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry by the constant interpellations of left populists and told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the high economic situation, according to a forecast, a real lesser wage value threatens German employees this year.
Experts mentioned all kinds of reasons to explain their prognostic pessimist.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to see a real decrease in their payroll from the previous year in 2007.
"The fault is the low wage development, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomic Economy and Conjuncture Research, in the journal "Image".
New unemployment insurance charges for the employee could also arise.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said to the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned decrease in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial assistance, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was known on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed inflation to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from one year to the other.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we believed so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind sparks at the poles, similar to those that appear on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that there are lightning on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe has proved this today - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus shines at about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud height, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprin theory, the lightning would have shown life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been, it must have been at a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be little living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venice's research, since no probe was on the way for the exploration of this planet since the 1990s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only highlight Venus' singularity within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than expected at first.
Thus, in addition to the already known windstorms at the North Pole, researchers found a cloudstorm at the South Pole, which is going much faster.
The phenomenon recalls air flows in the earthly hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns far slower on itself: one Venetian day lasts 243 days on earth.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets have been formed under similar conditions.
Of both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been fixed on Earth as carbonate, it is the largest part of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party's quarrel on the reception of Dalai Lama to the Chancellor.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and sums the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue," Köhler said in the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, although I respect the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproach that it would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German Chancellor did not take her distance with the traditional politics of one China.
"China also knows that," Köhler said.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his discontent about the reception of Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained, inter alia, about the "frontier policy" of the CDU in the field of foreign policy.
After the reception of Dalai Lama to the Chancellor, virulent irritations occurred in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government has not only disappointed the Minister of German Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to information from the Spiegel, frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of the two countries.
The leader of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now requires German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, thus supporting the Chinese position of Wen Jiabao.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama would show that it is trying to separate Tibet from China from other Tibetan regions, including other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against rebels like those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars in fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against rebels like those of France.
Everything needs to be done to ensure that the social insatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, called for the Minister of the German Interior.
Barricades burning, breakers shooting on the police with hunting guns: after the serious revolts of young people in France, the German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form itself in our homes, and that violence begins.
We must take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the municipalities were already working firmly to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to Islam conferences, this already shows its first success."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble notes at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had been in serious street battles with the police last night.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned.
The President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, required greater integration efforts from the German government.
In view of the rebels in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Colat emphasises that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
First and foremost, more training spaces should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
In addition, many immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
In the meantime, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with headlamps.
The local authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, the deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces ensures calmness.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the rebels in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the disorders were over in Toulouse.
The uprisings blew up after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Chancellor's utopic stage shows that the coalition has finished with the background - and there is nothing to expect from her.
In what country does this chancellor live?
After his disappointing speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, we must say: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach of too much focus on politics was dismissed by Angela Merkel from a hard and presumptive sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither concrete interest nor feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela appeared as a cloud: a politician in a fury, fleeing in foreign policy and even staying there in the near vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes the agreements of Heiligendam, but does not say how the climate objectives must be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of self - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it cramps with all the formulas made, that growth would touch people.
By this it destroys its image as a pragmatist, which solves the problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela Cloud Empire, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few additional phrases for this.
In this regard, the number of times in which it is working in the case of family allowances is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-specific phrase.
It's titube in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the debate of Youtube of the Republican candidates to the presidential, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and now have to fear a candidate outside.
The tension of candidates is already erupted on the first topic.
He would have made New-York a "fugee for the clandestines", accuses Mitt Romney of his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one on his side by heavy reproachs: "I would say that his own house was a sea for illegals," Giuliani replied and blamed the former Governor of Massachusetts for having employed immigrants without papers.
Candidates rise to the attack: as the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain launches his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney is also a vigorous lesson from Vietnam's veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Chamber in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause are deterrent in the auditorium.
This is where again the weaknesses of the two favorites appear.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney contrit and apologizes to the base and the television audience for being still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani passes into a flowing node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civil life.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the army, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as President.
Thus eight years of army domination ends.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was deployed on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television has broadcast the ceremony live to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his post as head of the army to his trustee Ashfaq Kiyani, and had thus been subjected to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a blood-free pussy, the former general now rules for the first time as a civil leader.
By withdrawing the position of Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency decided by Musharraf on November 3.
Already shortly after his investment in Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to General Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with its ranks of lawyers, had rejected all appeals against the controversial reelection of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in Northern Waziristan in an attack against a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
The fathers of the Krautrock are returning.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1970s are rejoicing: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return are recorded their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The planned sensation occurs then in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his small box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63, throne in the middle of a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked on the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and possessing a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the whole audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, curves on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again has provided some emotions among Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys show that, indeed, the name is reasoned in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way so lasting that this group has been missing painfully for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially because what is wrongly called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize to the survivors of the Cologne Can group in 2003 for their work, we saw in the room the questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the surprise had no longer limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chile Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only and unique one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only for two years and that during this period, the impact power that felt was much less than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had shortly deployed in Kraftwerk and had finally become a guitarist with Neu!, who was perhaps the most radical German group at that time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster’s musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Commune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called was in the garbage a fanion of the Harmonia Ottenstein choral and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as quiet and fashionable as music sounded, the group suffered material poverty.
The harvest of the dead wood was not used by himself to seek self.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone thinks he remembers.
At that time Rother expressed the desire to force Harmonia to practice from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and met his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts" (hearts in flames).
Cluster reanimated in the 1990s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the Live Album of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the World Cultural House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be identified in relation to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase flies in the room in the middle of the unique sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar wired tools are used for the formation of legend.
Before, the three veterans are again busy to improvise.
But more by collating microphones to the organ and battery, to pull out the instruments from unused sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built themselves.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
The three in large figwers of technology.
To this even the choral of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, you cough and fall under the cloud of sounds, and you sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphase.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He never acted like rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the leakage of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who screams "68" is not completely wrong, and Harmonia is now no longer irritated by this.
But what's going on most of itself will be thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can knock on someone's nerves (?) or give fugitive moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderful Peace", two films again address the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the projects are too much based on action and the exchange of foolish shootings or rather they are too alarming.
Here, even Richard Gere in The Hunting Party can't help.
The good news first: while the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkans mountains, it is right there, in the most luguous back of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere was then found.
Lastly, we lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1990s, because much too much kind and futile roles in women-sensitive movies and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism have pleased him to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a beautiful representation full of eyes: at the bottom, his character of posting war Simon Hunt was what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so charming: a man who had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, had kept visible remains of his old charm.
But in spite of this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Mörder's Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless follow-up to missed films on the Balkans War.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovo francs, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbians are not presented here for once as the only causes of all the pains, this film as flat as a telefilm loses too quickly in action and exchange of foolish shootings.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can consider in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there has never been a real good movie on the Balkans War.
The history of the three American war reporters, who are conditional on tracking the high war criminal "the fox", could have become, with another director and another writer (two at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the soldiers cannot do, and for both males, it becomes a trip into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is simply not allowed to be the desert cynical with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic adventure with a Bosniac murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when, within the last five minutes, the delayer by an accelerated process manages that NATO, the CIA and all world premium hunters have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for a just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be seized of crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to state that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and he suspects the Americans and French (this must be exceptionally agreed) not conduct hunting in a sufficiently intensive way because of secret political agreements.
But the intentional good and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem of Brecht comes to our idea.
He speaks of an Asian demon's wooden mask on the poet's work table: "Compare, I see the veins of the swollen front, clearly: as it's tired to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they suggest how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the type of film on the Balkans War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add that there has never been any good movies on South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or on a mine field, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenside alle Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good movie on the holocaust with "The List of Schindler".
Some films still have to mature - those who are worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously in their time as heads of work.
But maybe we know that today too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delights the scenaries the lack of scrupules they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not" or "The dictator" have actually become as good as Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe we need to have the sarcastic and remote artistic look of the Romanist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkans War, he replied: "It only depends on the fact that some things never change."
"The big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvests the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The Mayor's decline with Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympics has been confronted with critical political and economic vigorous.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games at the edge of the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The principal director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described an abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent years, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to enter the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained in his previous statements on Wednesday, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic, at least until 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," Von Beust said at WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports at the beginning of December, about Munich's nomination for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the period of time we had planned up to 2028, we will have no chance."
However, the dream is not definitively part of the past, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said the president of the HSB Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the application would be more in contradiction with the statements made by the Chief of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have identified Hamburg's nomination for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first appointed Hamburg as a candidate city in the past few weeks.
The Mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because he played the Olympics card and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for an integrated plan for Small Grasbrook in the Olympics and a post-catering use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever links the concepts of Sweden and wooden box, thinks about Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Isn't that right?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden throw shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeiting.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had doubted the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of 1968 in Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museum and Stockholm today resulted in a disinspiring result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift to the Moderna Museum in 1995, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which are circulating on the international art market.
The old history is overwhelmed, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes in New York, based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap boxes.
An exhibition of her work at Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - presented hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not artworks, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to Moderna Museet.
Today, witnesses of the time are talking about about about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered right into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed that later than about 100 wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have surrendered to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that date Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, chief Conservator of the Moderna Museum, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, including two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and pressed, and then applied with a brush of white oil painting.
On the contrary, the texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals that the painting was directly applied without a layer of background on the stratified panels, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not take another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board, of course, announced that it would investigate the "safe accusations" that will be raised in the case of powder soap boxes.
But since then we've been out there with an inexorable silence.
The Rebel Soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones that had cut off in a hotel in Manila, and who had called for the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told journalists in the hotel that he could not answer any blood spills.
Soldiers who were faithful to power had taken the hotel shortly before using lacrymogen gas.
The two dozens of soldiers had cut off in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of an attempt to putsch missing in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the hearing to suddenly shrink with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, apparently had deserted for him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal forces to power locked the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who commanded the Rangers Rangers Elite Unit, said that other military units wanted to join the march shortly.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a great demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption for months.
Since 2003, the finance district of Manille has been the theater of the attempt to mutiny around 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the military refused to join it.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have already been made to putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has provided more than 20 per cent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14,46 euros, as the society communicated on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of social capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a rebate before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we are seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL, reported United Internet.
Just before, presumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third part, says on the market.
On the eve, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10 per cent participation in the Drillisch mobile telephone company.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares in the stock market worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet purchased 5.15 million for EUR 31.1 million.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephones.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a spokesperson from United Internet.
Both companies founded the company in MSP participation to absorb the freenet competitor.
At the moment, both companies want to feel satisfied with their 10 per cent participation in Freenet, and do not take advantage of their right to add 18.49 per cent additional to Freenet, said United Internet Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all options open, especially to increase participation in SA Freenet, has been learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still hardly predictable on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers associated with a mobile telephone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet and Drillisch Holding had up to now a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 per cent of Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
