White pion at f3, black pion at e6, white pion at g4, black lady at h4 - failure and mat! This is called by joking in chess circles the "math of the mad".
Whites: turn on a1, pion on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pion on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. Whites put the opponent in Zugzwang by playing the tower on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the tower on a6 or move their crazy to any other case of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites advance their pioneer from b6 to b7 and offer failure and mat. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pion on a7 with the same result.
