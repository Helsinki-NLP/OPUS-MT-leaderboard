AM in Wales is worried that "behave like a puckon"
Some AM members of the Wales National Assembly are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will, as planned, change the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM throughout the political spectrum is concerned about being ridiculed.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rims with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who can't walesian: Twp means dumb in walesian and pwp means pie.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "discontented" and has proposed other options.
A conservative walesare said that his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Walesian like the U letter in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision for which members of the assembly should be called is so clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Walesian congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly for the Wales Parliament.
The current title of AM was proposed by the Commission by Welsh Parliament Members (Members of Wales' Parliament) or WMP, but MWP was most supported in a public consultation.
AM obviously proposes other options, but problems in reaching consensus may cause problems for Presidium Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation on the amendments also includes other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what they should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonia conducts a referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on if they are to change the name of the country to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to conclude a dispute that has been ongoing for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, is opposed to the referendum on the change of names and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The watches in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem run into trouble
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither one nor one."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"The people are being met in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer like the living room in the area, where people go on a regular basis."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient as far as the leaders are waiting and that "early or later they will end up on the box again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartments with property apartments filled with persons who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually result in the closure of all churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation they also built the watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the poor's watches."
The expert who played the watch game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin's are a complex history of architects and entrepreneurs – some of them hired by the church's playwife, others of the episcopic foundation.
The church meeting – the governing bodies of the congregation consisting of the Lecters – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed anxiety that the foundation would "spoke to transfer the cost" to the church assembly, despite the fact that the church assembly had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark hurts 13-year-olds who dive after homber in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy who came after homber in California on the first day of the homber season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and paddling there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to find a hummer, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bite!"
"I've been bite!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole key leg had been cut up.
"I called on everyone to get up from the water. "It's a shark in the water!", said Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is declared critical.
It's unclear which shark it was.
Badguard Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim had traumas on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with merchandise-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores of the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the fast buyer's attempt to fill the shelves that were previously raised by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have greater space with selected areas, such as in shops like Boots.
The shop chain also relaunchs its boutique make-up brand so that most products are vegan – which requires more and more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test stands in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local shops means that quick shopping must do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like goods in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought the two chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased the sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The earlier attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a face lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a discussion on how Boot's sales revenue would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide advice to customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "groaning" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal at £11 million
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones is "wrapping" about the fact that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones annoying by pulling out their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "racing" at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer had the time to focus on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The activity has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to get out shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that this Morning’s decision to withdraw can cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-born mother Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of president in March.
The couple holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Hard talk "and we fell in love"
He joked that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "invaluable a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newssankar vote":
"I didn't give up anything."
He said that Kim wanted a second meeting after Trump commended their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have ended up.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diploma, Ri Yong Ho, said to the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that, instead, the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results – an end to rocket tests, freed hostages and returned remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroys islands in Indonesia, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had lost their homes, there was no emergency permit, which was required for international assistance.
"In many cases they have, unfortunately, been very clear about not asking for international assistance, which makes it complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
Saved children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The lack of a tsunami warning sir in Palu, despite a warning being issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters complicate logistics further.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's wasted infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and trains.
But lack of funding has bothered Mr. Joko's administration for next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also pressurised by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machets, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicked in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a 89-minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London Saturday.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and shooped a kick to the away pole.
The attempt flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga’s hope and ended up on the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think so much about it, but just kicked."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a goal for the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker smashed a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned from the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
And then he got a great fire that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from defense and got the ball in the net at the far side of the pole with a left-foot shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will be opposed to VIdeoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
The death rate of tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that crashed in the 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves up to six meters, said the office's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of bribe from buildings that crashed.
Police arrested, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We're at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspect to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police inform the victim's nearest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said that no one should enter or go out of the building.
He became untargeted when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up on the spot.
She says "it's so terrible" every time and again.
At 2:00 p.m. there were two police cars inside the lockout and another just outside.
A number of police assistants stood inside the lockout with overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are requested to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of disputes about rewriting history
A banning would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "darkness" and "try to write about history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace should be incorporated into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconic laser during the English civil war was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th century's view of and is part of the history of a man who thinks it should still be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, believes that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, there is an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected our nation's development, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and celebrated.
Killer pig kills farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a stool on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is ready to inject vaccines in pigs in a pig tit on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig tit near was open.
He said there was a big pig chin in the pig tail with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kg heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin named Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on site.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused him serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 pounds pushed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife frightened it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012 a farmer in Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs normally are not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remnants of the Rosa hurricane for extensive rain to the southwest of the United States
As anticipated, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwest USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, 5 o'clock EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a train begins to form over the Pacific and travel east towards the US West Coast. When Rosa approaches the island of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical humidity north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching trail will create extensive rainfall in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, flows of life and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorated conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go to the desert at foot when tropical rain is expected.
Strong rain can make canions swinging rivers and storms lead to strong local winds blasting around sand.
The approaching train brings some locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to flows of life and hale roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rain period.
Some scattered tropical raincuts will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes wider later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in central United States on Sunday.
There is almost 10 degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern USA are expected to have a warm start in October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeast of the USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern USA in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million watched the Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults that would have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadly situation continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flakes agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she's absolutely sure Kavanaugh was tapping on her when he was drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks showing the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
Compared to that, there are as many viewers as they are playing a football game in the final game or the Oscars gala.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3,1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest continued to be high after the interrogation.
Flake was in the focus of Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters who shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judicial Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters screamed at him, as was shown in direct transmission by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he tells the country the truth?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judicial Committee voted on if they were to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominated in the next week, which the minority democrats have called for.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of the United Kingdom and to undermine the interests of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "completely unfair".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS's subsidiary WAFB.
After he was interrogated with Simpson, the police said he confessed that he shot Wayde.
His bail was fixed at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The legal doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shooting wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police escape forces, the police's state law lab, the Southern University police and residents in the area for their help with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flight and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "breaked" and "cocked" of Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano pyr ashes over Mexico City
Ashes from the Vulcan Popocatepetl have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity had been discovered in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes over the 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several mullers and scalps.
Pictures of social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7,1 hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police meets with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators met with demandall police at the same time as thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were held back by demandall police threw eggs and colour powder on them, leading to dark dam clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles also broke out later during the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups cried "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried "length life Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The mood is still tense in the region that is longing for independence one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was praised by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but the participation was low when the majority of those who were opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent collisions last year when the police tried to stop the vote at electoral stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration, however, took place, but was forced to take another route.
The elector Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the protest of the separatists with his wife and said that he no longer believed that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy to be able to vote, but now we've been stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal win in regional elections in December, Catalan parties for independence have been difficult to maintain their driving force this year, when many of their most well-known leaders live in self-indicted exile or are in jail waiting for trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been quadrupled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Mr Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since the end of last year, announced that he intends to candidate for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"A candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subtleness we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving in the house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.

Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and condemned Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not received a away win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before it, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes the Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston extends its winning range to six games – principal coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross-visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they did goals; their righteousness gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nick across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home ward was impermeable and target guard Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregors feet and Lithgow shot broadly from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings entered the target area of Livingston and were handled without any problems. Two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge by exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their game style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honour to have galvanized the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defence, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home page once – and it is something of a watch clock for the Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited smiles and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become involved in human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dual protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and is condemned as a single-minded officer of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cycling dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a crash with a car in London.
The collision took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-run road in Deptford, southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurse was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a crash on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in trouble in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The concerns broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still in progress.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the concerns, involving eight prisoners in a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial damage.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those behind it will be assigned to the police and can receive extended prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, demandall police were called to prison to deal with serious concerns where personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of the Hurricane Rosa moves over the desert in the southwest of the United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and into south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "10 tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border."
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwest of the United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5 to 5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas at risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the southwesterly USA suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, nearly 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
The Hurricane Rosa will first travel over the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach the country mass of Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can have heavy rain, which represents a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5-15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in southwest USA," said National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and flows of life in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous land.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three boys in teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stability".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask everyone who could have filmed what happened to the phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh's "lead, evil, anger" from the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ignorance and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "leathed the evil, the anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday and strongly denyed Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he was sexually offending her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusation before the Congress.
The President said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of our time's most skilled legal minds, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his supporters in the audience in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of republicans voting in the next midterm elections.
"We're five weeks from one of our life's most important choices.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm a candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are trying to " resist and stop".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the dawn and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning arrived yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone but dragged cars, boots and houses. It hit everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that the tsunami had traveled on open seas for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed into trees to get away from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and stores are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Afterscalving still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The row of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "great" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
He said that dead victims were found during the brigade of collapsed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damages may be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it may be much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised Saturday for not having informed that the tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top of a building hears frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water crashes towards the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately authenticate the video.
The Earthquake and the tsunami led to a large power break that interrupted all communication around Palu, making the rescue work for the authorities difficult.
The military has begun to send cargo flights to Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons still have a great need for food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for help and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from the World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu where they seek protection during presentations at the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the road, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun the bias of assistance, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if an exemption permit is issued after a disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not been called up yet."
When the second evening fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the family and friends of missing people still hoped that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles of dark natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was saved from a cloak.
On Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who had been stuck in brush for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian National Screening Team Trainer, had trained two of the missing screenshots before Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a screensaver, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the screenshots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages got only one grey bog, instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 under bankruptcy filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's employee who filled a banknote at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptyed a banknote in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, "a different man ran up behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the perpetrators' identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rappar changes name to Ye
The Rappar Kanye West changes the name – to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The being that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as a title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set off for "emotional reasons" according to the program's creators.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of those we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappares who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has previously written its name with and without strings and versals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to never use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution to students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Truppers fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on field research, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements on AI, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the USA and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
A double-sized budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthroughs are made in the USA, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China Department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the US government, as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to identify future visionaries.
In the United States researchers often have to work hard to receive funding from the government, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading university personalities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the USA with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to doctoral students within AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations donate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonian referendum on the change of names
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would resolve a decades of old dispute with Greece which has prevented its attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change of name would undermine the identity of the slave majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has led to doubts whether the minimum 50% participation required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question of the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the supporters of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing the name if it makes it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was divided, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome so that it is considered decisive.
The change of names requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Outside the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small scene and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by the boycotts of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head in the air, not sneak through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership in NATO would lead to the necessary investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Survey, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters thought to vote in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another survey carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of the participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them were going to vote in favour.
For the referendum to be counted, 50 per cent of registered voters plus one vote must vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlog for the Western-oriented government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through Brighton's defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple when he made goals for the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a passport from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He walked around a defender and ran away from several others on the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the target area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about he'd play for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he made goals at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League battle.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's repository on that game.
He sent a nice kick on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the outer pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net right before it got out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force up one more start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance to play the final game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a 5-2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for their first division title.
"We're playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to knit rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play on a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals hasn't announced their starts for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they're fighting to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-hand throwers are 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds speeches in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is appointed to the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of the Republicans voting in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
"All we have done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks from one of our life's most important choices.
This is one of the big, big ... I'm not candidates, but I'm candidates. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, struggling to stand up and stop.
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said and called the Democrats "grid and evil, and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judicial Committee, which was hit by a high tribulation from the viewers.
"Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
"Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a ...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, the security of the nation, about Europe – ironically similar subjects to which Jeremy criticised former leaders.
The Communication on the Meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
During most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But, unfortunately, many meetings now are not, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" politics has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the leaders of the party accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a wholehearted turn and take positions that I would not otherwise have agreed on – whether it was the security of the nation or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – follow a tiredness of social media that requires me to be dismissed, criticizes my policy and says that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are mostly directed towards me are political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they are confronted with a stream of sexual and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this policy is the level of insult that is now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour will promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church and with every censure and change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more and more narrow.
I have received many advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "all right."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher's government, which literally brought the classroom of my primary school to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need the most – both at local and as a minister of government.
I have never concealed my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused with my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the demand on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will harm households, activities and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to defer me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Uncategorized Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They're on top now, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home painting the profit, and the coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeatable, so we are so naturally happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt for the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he made points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the management to five points.
It became a long wait after a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the management again with a attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home story recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the Gregor Henry flank for the fifth attempt at home.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that he has been designated CEO of a licensed restaurant activity.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-lasting comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blowering restaurant industry".
"The Sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the Court will open the way to the Pacific again
Marines are patroling a riveted headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The base of the fleet from Lake Titicacas to Amazona bears the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also a longing to sail again on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in several decades now that Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the International Court of Justice on large screens over the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, will have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own exit to the sea.
The decision of Monday is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia's carismatical native president, who is facing a controversial struggle for reelection next year.
"We are very close to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is incredible that the court judges for Bolivia's benefit, and that not much would be changed even if it did.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And in the last four years, it could have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has thirsty to Chile's remaining will.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken exceptionally quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will give "a remarkable opportunity to start a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the issue of the sea as a political crack.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not destroy its nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made during a Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be at the border to resolve the death of nuclear diplomatin more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wish dream" to continue sanctions and the US protests against a declaration on the end of the Korean War will ever strike North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang starting with significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism against the fact that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of a gun arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveals the latest line of huge headsides on the way to shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crazy, over-dimensional headboards for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blurted the style icons of the Paris fashion week.
Incredibly unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent away their eye-catwalk creations.
Valentino’s primary creation was an excessive beige hat with a featherlike broad hatred that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other overdimensional accessories included jewelry-produced watermelons, a magical hat and even an ananas – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a wet suit with snorkel and dive mask, and another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you continue the huge courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge heights can be on their way to shops close to you.
The overdimensional hats come shortly after La Bomba – the halm hat with a breeze of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the unbelievably unpractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a sleeve beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit that was held in it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffiafrans and a white leather handle, appeared in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Celebrityist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for over-dimensional accessory."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Schottland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social engagement.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement tailored learning plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanding topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are the highest on the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade test.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students studying mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills such as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as thematic choices are now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on curriculums in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 concluded that employers had difficulties in filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this said, language skills become increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
No matter the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of over 4,000 adults British published by YouGov 2013, 75 per cent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
It is therefore so important to invest in language education for our children.
To be able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future has on its way.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for the young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the Sunday's first seasonal match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In anticipation of a confirmatory vote of its candidate for the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build up support for the upcoming mid-year elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress for the upcoming elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you look at it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's interrogation of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was thrilled by charges of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to one week while the FBI investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
So President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to "commit volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named to Reuters.
The night event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has gone after in the opinion polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him an increase in opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive in front of Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the couple competitions this Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment's swinging pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had an exhibition line and now it's four, so we wear it as a small momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage of four points in advance with twelve more.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in the sailing, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been vass from tea to green and precedes with a good example.
The trophies were higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive punch to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been behind with two after two games.
His pout that won them the game at 15 met with a similar throat, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
Europe's strange but lovely couple is four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the audience's reactions indicate that they are players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could comb home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, together with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they never even came near to demand.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to look close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fight-blood that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-somes matched with a 10-6 leadership over the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, who fought to keep the pokal they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really started during the 3-1 four-ball in the morning.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, only the second couple is to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed samples of occasional moments of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-some, and then seven in row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had not winded all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
The three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home with 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a lower position of four points in the single matches, however Furyk's side needs only an undefined result to keep the pokal.
After having been the second best for two days it looks like a counter-attack on Sunday may be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that they will "never" unarm unilaterally without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust against the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures to demonstrate its willingness" over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing installations and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any equivalent answer from the United States, however," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a approach divided into stages of nuclear power that would lead to the reward of North Korea as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution, just as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting President of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work against the "dismantling of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "resolving first" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by compelling and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of the war", says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a dream of wish for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier in the United Nations during the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party in this nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
Yet the sound of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the future ability to reach the US mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "complete" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we achieve a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stimulate funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of putting "gangslike requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear crawling complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moved against normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course of getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all doctoral students improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled "days".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often disastrous about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep shortage on learning.
"At the end, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University’s Health Services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after finding that the students suffered severe sleep shortages during the week.
The hourly course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how the athletic performance is affected by sleep shortage and the weight of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants will know how long-term sleep shortage can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in the fact that "dying" still exists, he said and added that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortage was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to sleep and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can make you turn on 24 hours, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's inequality side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for his first victory on the road since February 4-1 triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts .
Menga beat to seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on the target difference.
And there may be more problems on the top of the Rangers after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a main year after an object was thrown out of the remote end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-solved games overwhelmed opponents every time.
The Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been a goal for two minutes in the game when Menga's first passport let through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his great chance and shot outside.
A free park at the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
Rangers took control of the game, but it looked like more hope than faith in their game during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have had a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waived the Colombian call.
Rangers managed to do only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coubaly's nick and a tim kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shot in 34 minutes may have been against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their knitting deserved it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's solid situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit Scott Robinson, who was calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the trade gave almost immediate effect when the outside struck the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the trial.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who swept up long match after long matching.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the last stage, but McGregor was well able to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nicked outside after the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty requirement when he was hit with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanacka: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geigermeters.
Geigermeters have become a foundation for science since then and also characters great in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role in the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
"What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geigermeter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you turn these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it pops now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccin teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method means extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many forms of cancer and then re-injected
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different forms of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancer forms called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and thick intestinal cancer," explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by carrying a MAGA chip after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was buoyed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swollen appearance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would be candidate for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he had a Make America Great-keps, he ruled against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on the charges of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it wasn't broadcast, the playback of West's exhibition was uploaded to social media by the comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to drive West with the post.
West had also regretted in front of the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headbonad.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap."
They bullied me!
And then they say I've fallen low," he said, according to Washington Examinator.
West continued, "Would you also want to fall low?" and said he'd put on my superman cap, because that means you can't say what I can do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed generated, reported Variety. One person said, "There was death in the studio."
West had come in as a later replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rappar Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with their appearance of the song I Love it, dressed into a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most brave souls: back to STEPS ON YOU TO MOBBEN."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we are, she added.
Before the show told the rappar on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, even known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rappar colleague, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
They for murder attempts for knife cutting in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempting murder after a man was knifed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The respondent is expected to be at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its sword-driven role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has made a negative statement about the stereotype of the machohdils and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-player in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even she 31, admitted that he feels "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?", he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the great questions today - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's character Jon Snow loves, in the Emmys winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family affairs in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infected by sex is an urgent issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the infection cases are due to insufficient protection in sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking the GOP senator's tasks, signs of "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters condemned claims that one of her employees had placed personal data on three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Liars, lies and more disgusting lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included, according to the data, home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel interrogation about the charges of sexual abuse against the appointed candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters office and released the information about a member of Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been jeopardized as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - was not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement received rapid online criticism, including by the former press secretary Ari Fleischer of the White House.
"This denial is angry," said Fleischer.
"This suggests that she has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They may not question the reasons of the questioner.
They must be calm and unclean."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was candidate to resign Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
He tweeted, "Streat of Truth."
In its statement, Mr Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent requirements.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parodie by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with British inclination, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodies fired in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will we be saturated about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export goods?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the gummis face has been licensed to mess up for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation for the biopublik even in non-English-speaking countries
He is, of course, the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims for smoothieglamour, has received a small piece of Clouseau, a pussy Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two nice moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and when the rotor leaves hit his helmet for a short while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels quite low and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible itself now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English's strange perceptions are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stump film braves in the role of Bean.
The constantly topical issue is now that the UK is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British supersecret web network of spies, which reveals the identity of all British agents outside the field, to the agent in the great discontent of service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last stance of a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hard-worked figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of its political popularity: Emma Thompson does its very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her adviser informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the tribal Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any well-favoured institution, but who offers informal lessons in the art to work undercover next to it.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long lasting sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a Jolly hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to lost.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terriblely wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service and hit Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the carismatic technical billionaire, who claims that he can solve the UK's computer dispute: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssy of farsarted trains: dressed to servers, they fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on board Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the last sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast, it has an air of child TV around itself.
It's pretty moderate, like everything.
And like with the other Johnny English movies, I can't keep thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies the development of a plan to allow the British to work a four-day week but to receive pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour is considering a radical plan that goes out on the British working for a four-day week - but is paid for five.
According to the party, business leaders will transfer savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but retain the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda for the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior representative in Labor said to The Sunday Times: An examination of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"This will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits in the party's attitude to balance the economy for the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the The Greens party that promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not identified by Labour as a whole.
One Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there is nothing the party agrees about."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless leaders" and "snyller" in state companies.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back their entire effort, since a Labour government can make "reductions" due to what they think has been wrong.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate boards and create the so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 per cent of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then stands to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the TV program "60 minutes" tell us if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the Agency's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems inextricable.
"I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and that would take a dynamic complaint," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her namers couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive performance of stars and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people traveling to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goals of the event: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocate group that hopes to be able to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "action" such as volunteering, mailing a world leader, ringing or otherwise meaningfully contributing to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered by its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that account for more than $37 billion, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and notices arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group appreciates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors involved in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat under-education in the area after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as underfeeding a note in history," said the Ambassador of the Tracey Ullman Partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that, after more than 5,000 measures have been taken requiring the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes nutrition programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the usual questions on his website: "What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's event in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports states the Minister of the Interior
The government can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has the American Minister of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke revealed, quoted by Washington Examinator.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - particularly where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the "speaking of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were really the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and exchange fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "dayborn" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements will come after the Trump administration's goal is to increase the exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "fighter" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's Minister for Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly deny that a third party disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "small thinker" if she is to take part in the presidential election in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "small thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the US mid-year elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider making a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top," she said, "The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm going to take a real thinker to go to the presidential post."
Warren weighed on President Donald Trump during the Council meeting and said that he took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been free-speaking in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We obviously need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe she would be candidate in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "incredible" Massachusetts electors said that the senator should not be candidate, according to a study carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through now when he is back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and some of the trauma with which our soldiers return," she said to the audience at a gathering meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elefant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and airplanes and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunk condition, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as District of Columbia support the question of a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal trial against a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seekers challenging the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner, "and his violent gang members," mistreated her, but American officials denied her asylum on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities that enabled illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "misses decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications should be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances in force and that provision is contrary to that principle," according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to deliver necessary labour".
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum had never been meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - facing people every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death rate doubles in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more and more dark.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her febrile boy in a evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance is collecting dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a deficiency."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rotting through water damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were affected by a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong afterbearing.
With teared eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We couldn't escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming at help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda advertisements"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a quarterly ad in an American newspaper on the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump pointed out last Wednesday that China Daily paid an extra in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the US 6th Congress election, something China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to mix in US elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in an escalating trade war with higher tariffs on each other's imports.
China’s reimbursement rates early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa supporting Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "doubles the pest by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's lovely tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda through the publication of paid advertisers in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper sketch on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of abnormal voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the Chinese worrying economy, because the media is controlled by iron hand by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most outstanding newspapers denied the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters from mid-year elections through the Kavanaugh fiasco, warn analysts
Since many top pre-publicans defend the Supreme Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh who is facing several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlog, especially from women, during the forthcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
The clock cannot be turned back, says Grant Reeher, Professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) last attempt to an FBI investigation will be enough to calm up angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesters "November will come!" were scandalous when they protested in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"The people say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony with charges of sexual abuse against the appointed candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a backlog be followed if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the Committee's vote or final vote, it's about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have handled her," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic campaigns for the news channel.
But the Americans generally seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the waters of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed last week before the Senate Court Committee under oath that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her gender organs while they participated in a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruptt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are given access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inruptt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some program developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer codings.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the top over a night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic to this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I celebrates
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victoria Cross during the First World War is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his conduct during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never heard that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial was uncovered by his two grandchildren under a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "shiny symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the price.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Col Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later jumped up to the shooting line and led with "great braveness" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lieutenant Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble to."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he " felt very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead saw Greta Gris
Imagine this, you have stopped all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to look at the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 games, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after staying awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartooned child program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Deputy Director of Marketing and Communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Great pig, yes"
Bellators CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution to the readmission," said Coker.
"But there is six in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the change of program upset many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But in fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over the head in our efforts to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "subordinate" due to sexuality
The Olympic diving Tom Daley says he felt lower than his companions during his growing up because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about homosexual rights to give other "hop".
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming parent.
The regular programme manager of the popular show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to disease.
During his one-time performance at Laverne's first program, Daley tells him how he felt "minor" than others during his growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he did not betray everyone when they eventually found out his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic Bronze Medalist has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the word because he felt that he had the chance to live openly without limitations and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-fold world champion said that his love in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar loser last year, but he said that the difference in age had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he took part in his first Olympic as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about where they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't say to him: you won't be able to sit on the front line of Dad," he said.
"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally confessed that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and still gave him rages.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson from the form on the bench during Saturday Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will hit record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the fivefold winner spent his day between acting hejaklack and training on his game in the hope of getting a chance to show up his ability.
He has never been the lover of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long rod often misses hard.
It is not just the course that discourages, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the Novis Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below in front of the 12 single matches have wind in the start, Mickelson's match may be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams in previous seasons and in the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is, and we'll be happy with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was nice to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane debuted in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the minimum margin with the result 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You remind you that we led a lot on Valderrama, we led a lot on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and button," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing 2018's class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give you everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the painting.
Our goal is to try to win this pokal and that's where our focus lies.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
The bear was satisfied with the performance of its players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow will be waiting for new challenges.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that apply and that is quite different.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golf player is tested fully.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also has to go out and get the best of himself."
Contrary to Björn, Opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exception Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furnish itself has been on both sides of major conversions in the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medina.
When the pace begins in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-matches.
We made our show and placed the guys we wanted because, you know, we're creating some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said about his single choices.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The German fleet's latest fregatt would have been sailed in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the cold war, but it will not be sailed until next year, at least because of incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The operation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Fregatts, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that emerged after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-fregatts.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of aircraft and sea target missiles, as well as certain sleeve technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest fregatts for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the ban-breaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already outdated when they are in operation, writes Die Zeit.
The desert F125 Fregat created titles last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and machine guns" that made the warship worthless if it was used on a battle mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older fregats in the Bremen class.
It has also been found that the vessel has a significant overweight, leading to deteriorating performance and limiting the marine's ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to incorrect hardware, the entire project's price gap - including training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the latest fregatts are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
Previously this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet "begins to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said that this was a growing problem, since old ships were dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class Phregatts could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the bats
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
We hope that the results will bring new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to control future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarf Pirtel as well as brown long ears and Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track fladdermus activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Expert noise analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat noise and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Care Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of habitat that are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of weeds and how best to maintain forest lands for bats and other related species.
Fladder populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects boom and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks from home taxes.
Fladder mice isn't blind, actually.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the whale.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their airway.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, examine boo and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of wheat trees and a variety of favourable habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He emphasises the importance of searching for bats before doing maintenance in properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly eliminate a whole population.
Fladder mice is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, bother, or destroy their bones.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to prosecute the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "false news" and says people "willing to market" by using his name.
His lawyers will prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) beat off the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the requirements were reported.
"No no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the fivefold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," said the player and smiled.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about claims, which they have called "unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral injury to a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a conciliation because she felt "speed for retribution" and was worried about "being humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to cancel the conciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom will "forever regret" to lose car manufacturer
The United Kingdom would " regret it forever" if it lost its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "thinking" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems are what the car producers say are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to border disruptions as the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and consequently production would be forced to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need an arrangement. We want the best agreement that enables, as I say, not only success to be appreciated now, but for us to take this opportunity." he said to the BBC Radio 4 program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government officer said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "offensive for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court appointed Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the president's potential obstacles to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, has given fuel to Washington svalller for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying listening equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his departing appeared.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced at the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "precede" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee interrogation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "A date for it has not been established, it may take place this week, or a delay of one week in view of all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date. "
Some reporters would argue that Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disguise against TV reports that "play for the gallery", although she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several questions sessions than any president before him," she said and added without citing evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place," Sanders said, "but if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the President may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the rapporteurs.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland in view of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the cost of dissolved status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continued, in view of decisions expected to take place in autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I appreciate every employee's effort, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and societies we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodorees, reports Tennessean's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State principal coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred just before the mid-term.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a blade was released for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/ extent of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five coats on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 coats.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp taxes when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the new Tory party plans
The measure will neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp taxes will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The UK Department of Finance expects to receive up to GBP 120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be entitled to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success by attracting young voters with promises of housing at more affordable prices and targeting high-income beneficiaries.
The increase of the stamp tax will be charged by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a lift to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on recreational housing and housing purchased for rent. It may be up to 3%.
The Department of Finance believes that the measure will reduce up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK. This drivers prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many well-kept areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new game will only be a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first dwelling.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas for affordable housing in order to solve the UK's "draughty housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an overwhelming enough proposals for housing reforms, including renting ceilings and an end to vexations without the fault of the tenant.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater opportunity to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "I said last year that I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who don't live in the UK, and even for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning their home has become just a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shot looks forward to the challenge of blazing lives in the club from northeastern England, which is currently third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B-land team and that's all," Ross says to BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland on Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage a club."
Among Ross's representatives are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about following such established names in such a big club. He has previously refused to offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I judge success on the basis of the answer to the question "can I get this club back to the Premier League?"
This club belongs absolutely to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I think I would only see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years, after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month sejour as a member of Hearts trainer team.
Then he helped Alloa to come back from decommissioning to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close to decommissioning to becoming winner of the championship title season afterward.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his gaming career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a reason," he remembers and refers to when he took over the command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
That sounds weird, because I had good results and could live well on it, and I had some big successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
It's still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done throughout my adult life."

An investigation shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heat bow has resulted in increased revenue for the country's fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have had greater pressure.
Figures showed that public and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA, which has compiled the figures, said: "Continued with beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we could see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%. However, the restaurants had even greater difficulties.
The decrease in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8 per cent in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars offering drinks in particular showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The outcome of managed pubs and bars rose by 6.6% that month, and food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman at the servering and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports events are still the main factors in sales in the wholesale market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, even though a sales decrease of 4.8% each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have become more inappropriate for companies driven by food sales. The time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August give any well-needed trip."
The total increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Sector Sales Supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the public bar and restaurant industry in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on how it works for 47 active groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
A survey shows that one of five children, sometimes younger than 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that there is sexual content placed there
20% of students said they had a "main account" they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A study of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result is late for concern that there is sexual content posted there.
20% of students reported that they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother sniffing over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
According to the study, carried out by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of the children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Board of the Scottish Sports Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as an external member of the Board of Directors' Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious free athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her wide experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now expert commentator on BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time had to show if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows sharing the internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humoristic funding to show the freedom of the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a pile of cows to a song with text lines like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know it, this is not a juver, but tits."
The refrain continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused fighting on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light over the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we, they have to become pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their children are taken away from them only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comment: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mothers and children.
But of course, why not use them to make advertising for a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What a reality from the advertising film."
Others defend the film, and one woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is genius.
I would've got one if I still breast-feeded.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising movie is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," someone writes.
Another comment: "This is a fun advertising film that turns to moms who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like 'coats'."
This is not a film that homages or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, women reveal that they have all danced with the discrete pump stuck in the chest.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a breastfeeding cap, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while showing in a entertaining and easily recognizable way what incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates titles.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp near the border of Texas
The number of children who have been deprived of liberty has been pushed up even though the number of people crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the ugly rhetoric and hard policies introduced by the Trump government, which have made it more difficult to place the children in references.
Previously, most reference individuals themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fearing to put their own opportunities to stay at stake in the country by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Office, witnessed to the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of persons who had applied for references to single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known by the law enforcement authorities since then.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," Albence said.
In order to handle children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be in court within one month of their incarceration, rather than after 60 days, as previously practiced, according to staff in the facilities.
Many of them are present on a video link rather than personally in order to bring their lawsuit before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to have the right to protection are rapidly deported.
The longer children are deprived of liberty, the more likely it is that they are affected by anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to the staff in the facilities and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that anxiety rises at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has been difficultly ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and to say goodbye to friends, the traumas can worsen many of them.
Syria demands that American, French and Turkish "occupiation forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian land, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and provide advice to both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the hostile country.
As far as the refugees are concerned, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" which enables refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They politise something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The USA and the EU have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement discouraged a large-scale attack of Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaida-connected Nusra Front, which will be "exterminated".
The United Nations Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of government and of the opposition, to make a draft post-war Constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mr Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a reelection
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless his presidential office is prematurely terminated through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In that which would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
At present there are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and are almost three times higher at MSNBC, 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has toped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news evenings.
"This is like a fire to which people are attracted, because that's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a many-year comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club." She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' says Nell Scovell to me.
In the chaos there is a entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the Washington report can determine the future of the case in the abortion question, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one suddenly sat and watched a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bombing jacket of straw leather for $15,000 ("a cloth filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump follower's rotating role crew and daily intrigues (musk with NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single section, you'll get back on it.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, there was sun and 27 degrees outside his house on northern Kauai on Hawaii, but he sat and owled inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn't scratch himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate Committee on Justice and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wave bowl.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever before mid-year elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congress District receives a lot of money, because it is thanks to the restructuring of a Congress District that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This recent suburban district in Pittsburg is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who received its place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing conflict between the major parties' economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a button win in a broadly monitored special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the democrats a certain advance.
USA considered to punish El Salvador for China aid but then backed
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with a little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the shareholders wrecked the Trump organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "now decided not to recognize Taiwan," he said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017. The money would include drug control and development and provide financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely affected the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, said the diplomats.
And the three American messengers returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishment from Washington.
One spokesman for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, two of whom agreed to discuss internal discussions against promises of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration and who also made an anonymous statement.
Study History
The next inevitable step can be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse in legal proceedings, for which there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to conduct his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the Congress would change the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that Assembly just when he prepares for re-election, and perhaps finally before a citizen jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to set up a coup against Hitler, if only the Western countries had opposed him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History circles around such crucial events, and the inevitable progress of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who checks what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to record the president secretly, and speculating that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times reports aren't correct.
"How do we answer if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he can access the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections for a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovakian Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to turn on sabbath lights on the table decorated with the hook cross.
With that inheritance, how could I be other than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic for the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal that ended unoffensively earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europe League.
One kneeled prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2-game against Villarreal. But he thinks that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for greater successes.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Maybe we could have got it in the end, but in general, it was probably not a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we got back in the second half, and we were better in the team.
Now on Thursday it will be an important evening again in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly get a good result.
Last year was very hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it to their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the countrywide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care unless you talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a great impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a cash-value hybrid life insurance solution to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own resources, if you can afford it.
Establishing legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Establish a care authority, so that you can designate a trusted person who takes care of your medical care and ensure that your healthcare staff follow your wishes if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a mandate for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that you have an old parent who gets into an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you then be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It is not just the economy that is at stake, but who are the doctors?", asked Martin.

Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is finished."
They shoot several times with air guns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air guns when he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who was at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 2:30 p.m., as a "one-time event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to hear from themselves.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
The communications are excluded, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain information from the Donggala management area, a region north of Palu, close to the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The population of the city was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area stretching more than 300 km from the northwest coast of Sulawese.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
The support pillars of the economy of Central Sulawese are fisheries and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Even in 1996 the West Donggala was hit by a tsunami who killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the circular Pacific seismic electricity, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on the north of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami hitting 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that struck over the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7,6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit one of Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A basic earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya management area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily set on the beach.
Sarah Palin's elder son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the elder son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for having been reported of domestic violence and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a woman who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is confiscated in the Mat-Su prison and is held against the $500 deposit to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the warranty, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three minor crimes under Class A, which means he can get prison for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious offences under class B, which is punished by one day in prison and 2,000 dollars in fines.
It's not the first time that Palin is accused of crimes.
In December 2017 he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of being involved in the notification of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of the Indonesian city of Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck over the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for a suspect for terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, who killed eight people. It is a rare penalty that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a rented truck from the construction and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He talked about pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body injury, according to the declaration of intent on death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both accusations may constitute a death sentence, according to the court's case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with a 22-point federal jury, including eight murders to support protection activities, often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a comprehensive planning and purpose", said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way Saipov carried it out as "abhorrable, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not been charged in a case where death penalty is claimed over a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder of two drug dealers, but finally sentenced to lifetime prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of stamping for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of regret during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be placed in his hospital room, said the police.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He said they are "probably disappointed" on the decision of the prosecutor's site.
"We believe that the decision to claim death penalty rather than to agree to lifetime prison without the possibility of conditional release if the accused acknowledges himself guilty only extends the trauma caused by these events to all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim death penalty.
Ms Tories said that Nigel FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know the heat" of the European scepticists, when one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
On the march in Birmingham, Conservative Member Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom would have "outdated" if Mr Farage had been Minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May to bring the deeply shared supporters to reconciliation has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under attack by Brexitan supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her ally has insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlog, and force EU scepticists and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "caos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the Organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spool the Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made equal and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the rod, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must spoile the Chequers agreement."
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claims that public opinion would have changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to remain is completely uncertain."
Brexitan supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party also took part in the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is impopular to the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopular to the party and to our voters who are on the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May, "Premier Ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that the politicians must be "knowledge the heat" if they were to disappoint the decision taken with the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to disappoint Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, "We're not going to let you get away with it."
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to disappointing Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists whiped with bans with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour parliamentarian Lord Adonis from the Upper House ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"These people say that they can have on-site IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "decent thinker" to candidate for the presidential post.
American senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "decent thinker of candidateship for the presidential post" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts talked about his future during a town hall meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and now stands for reelection in November against the Republican Federal Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy President of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's been the subject of speculation that she might take on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she was planning to candidate for the presidential post.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the shooting of basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to get help identify a man that can be seen on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in his head and finally died of this," said police officer Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been there and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was taken to the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and cut 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hanged Hamilton on dry when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first and let Hamilton drive in the back of the clown, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went down on a row later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk to invite in place after a double draw to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back line and was seven at the end of the first yard on his 21th anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the tyres to reach a quick goal and drive again Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end he came into the depot on the 44th yard but did not succeed in raising the pace during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," Hamilton said.
A really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as Judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the testimony of Ford before the Senate Committee on Justice; instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "alright, disgusting and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the great thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, evil, disgusting and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks, and so they say: 'No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer? 'Did you leak the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
'If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything,' he added, imitating the senator.
The letter with details about Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darkened Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted."
But her dementia does not seem to have fit the President, who at the meeting of Saturday evening commented like this: "I will tell you one thing, that was really a bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he suggested that the democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power with all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite digital news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sonned the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 returmatchen in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-purpose management through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie repaid for the home story before Dwyer restored Belfast Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard vouched for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That was the fourth meeting for the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 at the assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In the intense first period Sullivan brought the home painting back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie quitting at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard recompensated once again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the profit with his team's fifth halfway through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of his last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Flyers died because hundreds of people on one plane could escape from earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is now commended as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftersquakes continue to torture the area and many are stuck in the cradle in the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly weakening control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure Batik Airs flight 6321, which then was on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would crash.
He died later in a hospital.
The speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are devastated to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may rise to over a thousand people, and the country's disaster relief authority says it is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is expected to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with dead bodies.
It's not good with clean water.
The mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we do not know what they will encounter there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Previously this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes at Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane crashing in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Sea now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped from the declining planet and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport on the Choujuköarna.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the events looked.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both announced that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing track.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was passing the landing track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others succeeded in weaving through midget deep water to the emergency exits on the declining planet.
He said that the cabin staff were panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
The American fleet said that seafarers working close to developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people on land before the plane fell in the 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The Attorney's page ended its plea in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to put together the 29-year-old who talked to Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, reported the Clarion Ledger news magazine.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis, he said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a time after Chambers' death, deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He blew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hiphop has come far from its origin in political messages and to tackle social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?!
A babygirl in New York is judging a couple because of dismissal after a "racistic" text message
A babygirl in New York is judging a couple for discriminating termination after she received an incorrect text message from the mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple denies that they would be racists and compare the atmosphere with "extortion".
The two-born mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that the new granddaughter Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ NOT A SVART NON", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice twice.
After she had realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "bad to courage," and fired Maurice, and claimed that their former granddaughter, who was African American, had done a bad job and instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she is judging the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She asks for compensation in size of $ 350 a day for the job she was initially employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple beat off the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only thing right was to end Giselle Maurice's job. They were worried that they could not trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the atmosphere with "extortion" and said that his wife would be born two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Should one go on such a person?
It's not very nice done," added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple of social media and criticizes them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Paddington writer Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented as follows: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It's very funny, given what we know now about Paddington's great success."
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bittled" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family," and added that her father was proud of her final success.
"He was quite silent of himself, and no squirky person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even if it is not yourself who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honour."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked for nothing to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, and that they were not expecting her to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die within two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll be right back to you.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly spit out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't look, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane together with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bended down my head, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women set up postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can be called to receive support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, and she tells me that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile shook up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the one who found his niece when he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to make people know that there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, has lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he was acting different.
On Christmas, he was on the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard hit for them, but they have to get through it. "There's a wound in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps get a little consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would be "split" because of deeply rooted disagreements.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in only five weeks, on November 6th. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to have elected to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called to the senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the death situation and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean decommissioners "declining" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes information from the South Korean Ministry of Reunion, says that 1 127 people jumped out last year, compared with 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher charges for human smugglers, are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not come with any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean disarmers are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border to North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the hard-watched demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean States.
China sees them as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which technically is still in war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for discussions focusing on the ongoing nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions of the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not unarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help me think that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of having untreated Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally affected, and occasionally he screamed almost and the voice bounced when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee, and said that the accusations against him were a "great and coordinated murder of character" organized by liberals who were angry at the loss of the presidential elections in 2016.
Mr Pelosi said that she considered Kavanaugh's testimony to prove that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was partial to the disadvantage of the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was given the question of whether she would try to put Kavanaugh before the Court of Justice if he was elected, and whether the Democrats were given the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – unless he tells the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. appellations court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about which decisions Kavanaugh may take against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion of Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the location of a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us to applaud all of us," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand up.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We're crying when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued, "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she became angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke with: 'You might think I'm sorry because I cry.
I'm mad."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood in basic terms.
One of my most obvious memories from one of my first jobs in a man - dominated office, where I once cried of indescriptible anger, was that I was taken in the neck of an older woman. It was a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a staircase.
"Let's never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy that they were able to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, who then was a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital deal on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt there was no reason not to investigate the idea of standing himself in the presidential elections.
"It wasn't a well-thinked decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last one they needed was another.
Somebody called it Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
As she was late out, she lay behind with the money collection, and gave the promise not to enter as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million together.
It was a project condemned to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger to sexism, that the voice was stabbed.
"You could have thought I had a nervous crash," Schröder recalls on the press's reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What shall they write on my tombstone?'
"She was crying?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening line of the trade war between the United States and China was ear-depressing. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
The US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by proving important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important step-up came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are taxed.
Peking has responded each time with the same coin. Recently, a fee of between five and ten percent was paid on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US's actions, and the world's second largest economy is probably not going to step down within a clear time.
Making Washington back up means bending for demands, but public crawling for the United States would be too embarrassing for China's president Xi Jinping.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing plays its short right, the US trade war press can give a positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies on each other.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the think media Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready to accept voluntary returning refugees and calls for help to build up the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and safe, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and subsistence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe departed with the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating Team USA with the final position of 16,5 against 10,5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European land and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the USA.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the end of the 16th hole pair of three tracks, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shine in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten out by 5 & 4 of the lowest ranked players of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who might have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European of the tournament ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It is about the team, and I am glad that I could help," said a röred Garcia after the victory of the European Team.
He left the stafett pins to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I am grown to look at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend with finding fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
After the devastating performance of the team, American captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fake.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work on the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being the captain.
You get to bow and bow.
They played better than we."
Algae blooming: The levels decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wild Commission shows a general decrease in algae blooming concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, inequalities are reported in the areas around the large municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate lower levels.
The algae flower stretches along over 20 miles from the coast, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Stains can be seen about a mile out in the sea outside the hillsborough municipality, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algae blooming has also been observed in the municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week. Outside Hillsborough's coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Respiratory irritation reports continue to come from the large municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida last week.
