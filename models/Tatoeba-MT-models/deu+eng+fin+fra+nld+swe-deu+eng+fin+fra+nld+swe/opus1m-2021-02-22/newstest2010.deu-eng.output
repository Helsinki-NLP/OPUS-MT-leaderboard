Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Nordweg metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president’s couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon the visit then reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the Prestige Prize.
He receives this as the fourth President of the United States, but only as the third who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when taking over the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he takes over the prize as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
He intensified the war effort a few days ago by sending other troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Gol medal, the diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to spend the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program then provides for a banquet with the president and his wife, where not only the king and queen of Norway, but also the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant to the price from the beginning.
He pointed out, for example, that he had the feeling that he did not earn the price entirely.
He also repeated several times that it is not only for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was a "demand for action" for him.
Nature protector is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the president of the "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for extortion.
In several cases he lodged appeals last year against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he called for money from investors in favour of him, said the Leitmeritz police speaker, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and it threatens him to have a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno don't smell well
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packs, in the southern Moravian localities you can find a step back and pull the sorting waste containers.
And in Brno?
There you would have to book a few minutes to find the suitable garbage tons.
I don't want to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me whether the councillors are insufficient to deal with this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brunn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the amount of waste tonnage for such waste.
Have they ever tried to discard the PET bottles in a collector basket in the center?
It's just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found to be a coincidence until now is the maternity square opposite the encountered goans.
Mr Unterka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but I do not think that is much too much.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not even a honey swallow in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends don't prefer to sort the waste at all.
For fakeness.
It's too far to the garbage tons.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered after the celebration to discard a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I didn't see any colour waste tones in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was on the road.
But the garbage almost passed over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city a ice hockey league that makes us shame in the whole Republic, instead of buying a few dirt tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner fountain.
I am glad that I could confirm my assumption with official statistics also after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of South Moors.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness allowances
After the left party, despite the government's view, gave farmers and officials more money, there is no longer money in the budget for pensions, sickness allowances and building savings.
But not for the government debt interest or for the international legal disputes.
This causes even more problems to those who will be in the government next half of the year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have implemented the wage increase for some groups, they expected that the government would also borrow the money for the sensitive expenditures, old-age pensions or sickness allowances. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
Of the loans are almost always paid higher interest rates, and the money has to be refunded sometime.
Too much to choose from where to take, the state cash is empty.
If the social benefits or costs of the State are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later for her children.
Because of the pensions or the sickness fund, whose account has gone 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid of getting that money.
But at the price that the government is in debt even more - next year, not just 163 billion will be missing in the state cash, but much more.
Despite the efforts made by Minister Janota, debt will increase as fast as possible, and with it also the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for compensation, then will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity money as the government made in its area efficiency package.
As a result of the decommissioning of money for some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the development of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be reprojected and possibly redesigned.
Up to all, get what is not free.
This means delay or termination of thirty large buildings, is also at risk of Europe's added money, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the flow of money salomonically - it attackes the CEZ shareholders in which the state is the owner of the majority, and then the money is distributed from them into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividend is never safe and it is not in any way an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion dollars on the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay environmental damage reliefs, fill the pension account and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to the EU rules, the actual budget deficit increases to the Nieveau of 5.7% GDP.
But this does not end the carnival of the reversal.
Nearly three billion lowered the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can handle it without this money is not safe.
That's just gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money inside or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of million are also missing for the two-billion state fund project that has already begun to monitor on-line, for which individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would come in this case, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will dominate two operating systems
For the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch by pressing a single button between different operating systems.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to press only one button, and Windows Mobile will be switched Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company wants to introduce VMware, which focuses on the development of virtual software for the computers.
We allow you to execute two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti explained by the company VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, where at the same time the mentioned systems were running Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full progress.
The company VMware is now working with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and to the customer is expected to arrive in 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains tortures the hotel owners
Scneeless slopes are not just worrying about the giant mountain residents.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering skiing in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms in giant mountains for all winter holidays incl. Christmas and New Year's.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Anyone who wants to stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers to save and where the quality of the stay comes only second, he can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mainly only weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think they will try to sell these for a while, but then they will have to give up, and in shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, said Jandura.
Free beds at all winter holidays always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
That's why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the Director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year’s Day in Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
Good sales will also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates will be sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in giant mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
To 80 percent for the New Year's stays, Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central park in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
This year of January, for which we are already occupied at about 60 percent, was a pleasant surprise.
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The giant mountain hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow crowd.
On Thursday it should cool down and if rainfall occurs, it should be snow on the mountains.
But then there will be a warming again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It's almost weird with what student strenuity Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy in the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the stupidest.
Finally, when he was sweating out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote them out of the copy paper from the bush Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the word "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward" without adoring.
Three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea - fresh contingents for troops in Iraq that was plagued by the civil war - as "unreasonable and karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and very successful one, so far as the news about Iraq no longer speaks.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
In order to increase the contingent, the military asked him again, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, severely criticized the charming shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation to the better.
The President hesitated for three months, but has not come to a better idea, and so he has deceived the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic about the entire Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the brotherhood war of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by counter-indication - no one can rely on and no agreements are maintained.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their views every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been formally correctly established, will only remain chips behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconsistency of the circumstances that further complicate Pakistan and Iran's influences.
The construction of a "capacity state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only continued to worsen, and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
That believes that the small soldiers who have broken out in the war cry about the "return of home" here create a miracle can only create a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in the wars in Afghanistan is a negligence.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hinduukush mountain pre-country.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved by troops.
This question needs to be answered during the period in which America is moving to Obama to the defeat of Afghanistan.
But every solution will also be a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three years still remain until the presidential election, and so it remains enough time to take a different strategy if it would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Managers Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The leading executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of money, but can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency, is at the forefront of efforts to connect Wall Street's premium bonus to long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of the criticism, after she put almost $17 billion off for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this yeara is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to the Reuters agency, despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to charge the bonuses of the bankers, which exceed 25 000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being prepared by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except in physics.
Today, in Stockholm, five record women from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the category and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
The prize for chemistry has been received by the Israelis Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the education of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics received by Americans Elinor Ostrom and her landlord Oliver Williamson for the analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith have carried out this award together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the acquisition of the money price.
It is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his course, and is also at the forefront of the country leading two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in keeping with his policy, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considered the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks of his stay in the government on Friday early, because he disagrees with the implementation of the State budget for next year in the form that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remainder of Janota in the Cabinet will be the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis in public finances.
The President's spokesperson, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
However, on Wednesday Parliament voted on the Left Party proposals for money conversion and increased the money for public officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has refrained from social democracy's proposals to cover up increasing the budget deficit.
The Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Right Party on the other, on the other, on the other hand, there has been a sharp internal political dispute, which is why the question marks the further work of the Fisherman's Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Criticists claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of savings measures implemented by the fishermen's government in autumn, which, as they understand, should end government debt.
Klaus, who can sign the State Budget Act, but does not have to sign it, today at the breakfast of discussion with entrepreneurs, said that politicians have neglected the "grave problem", which is the "insustainable deficit" of public finances, for a long time.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget was awful, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words in the editorial section as "sustainable statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was awful, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Un beaten" of the world shows a lot of the country, whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and her first black president, Nelson Mandela, presents in his life story the American Oscar player Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is taken over by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in Eastwood-Drama from the box section "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which eventually became a slaveholder, a fictive US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African state man was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in the cessation of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was set free in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unschlaged", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film describes a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugby team, Francois Pieranor, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players, which are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinematographic screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him in the evening and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's being transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pieranor, captain of the national rugby team, in which white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pierator for the first time in his house.
I remember when I ringed the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pieran in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of the actors compared to their actual models, he received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unschlaged" and he also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well performed movie."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence did not admit until yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava" which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started at all or damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers already write about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but lights
This already 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage occur to the rocket.
Probably the engine exploded at the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the shooting out of the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over the north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Furthermore, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the general government has kept itself against it and claims that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not expire and the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was done without error, the Department of Defence only considers six out of thirteen as failure.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfils the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly without problems once and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atom heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow with 51 years
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov, 51 years old, is present in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and probably already arrives in the Fridaysduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career forty years in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need a few other formalities to clarify, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergey Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of these who can raise the morals of other players, the co-player Nemcinov said.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to write 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union dress, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where in the Detroit Dress he lifted the Stanley Cup twice over his head.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai handed over to the trade unions. All overtimes are cancelled
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union that all overtimes should be cancelled.
On Monday, because of the often arranged overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees also receive it in the aftermath for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can be paid for the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holiday, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees are paid the ticket and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the claims and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift, until last week.
From the date of signature of the agreement, the willingness to strike will be withdrawn by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are to be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to lift the strike preparedness.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automotive factory increased when about 400 employees spontaneously strived for constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged shocks.
On the other hand, the management held that the employees had to make the overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on the employees who had interrupted production on the previous Wednesday in their Monday-streaking call.
In the field of overtime, the trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they demand this year to pay the fee of 5000 kronor.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production was started in the company in November last year.
Until this September, around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, with the current manufacturing capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with steeld HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the medicines already available.
AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, the patient can prolong his life and prevent the propagation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus propagation also results in the development of so-called resistance viruses against which no medicinal products are more effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as Metalocarborans have an effect on the protein that is responsible for the propagation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus propagation in different ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists come to new ́improved ́ compounds, prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled with a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Heavy and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no mature virus particles would occur.
When we eliminate the HIV protease, we also eliminate the propagation of the virus in the patient's body, explains the scientists in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe the whole range of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which then is further systematically changed.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in reagent glass, including against its persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Structure Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
A fight for budget. ODS went on to fishermen who fought
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "growing" and the government of the Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "sustainable statements".
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Deputy Chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Civil Service Cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he remains in office with the help of the Parliamentary Lefts.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, although it has proposed a left party amendment of more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has increased the money for public servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has refrained from social democracy's proposals to cover up the increase in the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should have a surplus of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has responded to the government's desire, because the amended budget is only a less poor variant of the budget provisory.
Disappointment and meaninglessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government still assessed the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened his resignation in the case that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota registered with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He suggested that he would consider his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the deprivation of the budget.
To what extent fishermen are in favour of the further fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Nominants of Social Democracy (CSSD) who had implemented the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficiencies-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness allowances and pensions or the new legislation on services.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not mistake
This is the matter of the Prime Minister and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in alternate function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if Fischer decides to refrain from fighting the high level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he is based on the left-wing majority currently in Parliament".
Then he is supposed to not be able to expect the support and tolerance of the citizens of the democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is to be the case, I will deal with it, Mr Bartak, Minister of Defence, appointed by the Civil Democrats, said to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Mr Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister would expressly ask Members of the Citizens' Democrats to allow them to accept the budget.
We do not appear as orphans, we are not small children, so he replied to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
Even when I waived the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be particularly Bolshevikization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new road map of the CD (Czech railway), less trains will be used for approximately the same price.
The Czech railway terminates or restricts some less loaded and local trains from 13 December, while other connections are reinforced.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by 2% from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer travel tariffs are not changed.
For example, several connections to the capital receive the residents of the Ostrava area, the railway uses the Pendolino trains for this route.
The speed train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of 8 percent, while an increase in Prague and the surrounding area can be expected.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and to a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the major changes is the introduction of the new direct traffic route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to move to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electricalization from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distances to the capital will end at the Prague main station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava, and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at the distance of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's Regional Railway Account: 200 million increase
The trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railways total to pay the so-called liquidity loss in the next year receive four billion crowns, just as this year. The local trains provide the districts, total they pay eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains as well as for fast trains, the railway has re-enacted a ten-year contract, and until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, and perhaps it has not taken to increase the prices of the large majority of tickets.
Changes occur only with one-day online CD Net tickets and with cheap eLiska Internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 kroners to 600 kroners.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
The Philippine Millitant captures more than 50 people and the children have been released.
Today, in the south of the Philippines, Millitante kidnapped 75 people, including some primary students and their teachers.
This was mentioned by the Agency AFP, which originally informed only over 65 kidnapped.
All 17 retained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 Millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators now strive to issue the rest of the hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the Millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police pursued the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local familial clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law was imposed for the recent massacre in which 57 persons were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which was associated with the election to the Governor's Office, were 30 journalists.
Due to the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of the South Phillippin province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
However, on Tuesday they resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippines government.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unschlagte", which includes a part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was supposed to have been elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The sideplay of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pierator, has received Matt Damon.
With the film starts, reactions from critics as well as the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakar Prize, and in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes into cinemas in a time where, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Championship are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time, the media are shaking the world public with scary news about the growing hatred of race and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruler majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa were generally positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupying of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, according to his own words, proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
On several occasions I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the performance premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can take this movie to the personality of Mandela and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book presentation of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united portrays the South African human rights defender in his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is trying to bring together two race groups, and for years and days, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also taking part in his role in the South African National Rugby Address on the World Cup field, which won South Africa at that time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may carry out the gathering of people into a single people, led by the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black man in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve, that will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, for example in the recent interview for LN the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Great Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
Transformators burning in the Louny area for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the circuit system near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny region.
In the fire, according to the speaker of the district firefighter Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were invaded.
Originally, the firefighter wanted to let the transformers burn out, but later she changed the view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water foam and special evaporators.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-in shortcut.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not jeopardise the security operation of the management system, according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated to be several SEK 10 million, and more precisely the damage will only be calculated after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced in accordance with Mandatova by a new one.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened to Ceps society, errors of this kind are rare, added it.
According to the speaker of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, and the fire of the transport station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
In the Czech territory, A.G. Ceps operates as the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switches with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to distribution system and line range with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura raises criminal charges against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Maures, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term agreements with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take the roses out, in this we only submitted the offer about the extent it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So there is nothing left to us but to fight us.
Due to this slander of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek believes the collection of the criminal prosecution for the further continuation of the media show by Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name as well as the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that in this case too, it will be clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railways and uses false and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura already reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the negative step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech railway and did not sign up for the order in a high of 150 billion kronor.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was already threatened, according to Jancura, by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we don't give up then we can lose the bus licenses.
He imagined himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, today Jancura said to the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococcus free and voluntary
Impfung against pneumococcus changes the habitual from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already now voices report that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The Medical Institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that the health insurance authorities have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children can be freely vaccinated against pneumococks born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further re-vaccination itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococks.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the professionals estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year.
However, they save the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
To date, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococks cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections have led us to the death of up to 28 children up to 10 years of age in hospitals per year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcus was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, they are expected to be paid by insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, the Head of Nahlas Civil Association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that mandatory vaccination would be better.
Its association is already in favour of pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to implement at least this.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for the vaccination against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, the president of the professional company of practical child doctors, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think about reducing the number of revaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
Professionals expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention, so that they save for further treatment, Cabrnochova sharpens.
The doctors have to purchase the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves anxiety of practical paediatric doctors regarding the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then received by doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some Members, however, feared that insurance could thus "bring the money out of the health insurance system".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kronor per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "Museum Diebstahl"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken with a trailer on invitation to his car with 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a bagger to enter the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of shapes such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press news agency, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family party.
The agency reported, according to a police oath statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta Senior contested any authorisation.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and cuts of expenditure announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to show that he meant it seriously with reducing the deficit by delaying the decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor also fired his target for low and medium-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1% cut-off limit in public salaries for 2011.
Social security disorders
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low-wage recipients are punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned against imminent "problems".
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion UK pounds a year - has made the private sector upset, saying that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE PREPARATION REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5 % from April 2011
This year, the decline of the economy by more than the expected 4.75 %
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small enterprises rejected
Taxes on electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in public pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates from the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £190, while a person with a annual income of £10,000 will be richer by £110.
Ministers said that their objective of halving deficits by 2013 meant "stricky decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes burden would be the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms contested that the sketched tax increases and spending stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are great figures. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is essential over the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour's forecasts on future economic growth – which affects the extent of re-indebtedness and the rapidity of deficiencies – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to decrease by 4.75 % this year - far more than the decrease by 3.5% predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
Missing opportunity
The Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of GBP 789 billion would be unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that the Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay it and push themselves "cynic" before difficult decisions until after the election - which will take place by June 2010.
"They have not said anything about what they will do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they have let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of Conservatives, which see the deficit cut faster and more.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned by tax increases and spending stops is used to cover expenditure for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the inflation adjustment above for some invalidity pensions next April - the Treasury Chancellor would suspend the accusation of voting because the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid if people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only be borne in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong deductions in many areas, possibly in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at the audit company Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-State report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "Festings of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported US citizens for suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Pandschab, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated if these are the same men who last month were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani origin, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"When they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the accusations that they are accused of and under which circumstances they are held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house earlier and that no charges have been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States had to work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misuse" in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International on human rights, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been in the past 20 years.
The report describes the regime's "misuse patterns" both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Official authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedchad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak crime centre.
But since then there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"Falsches Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty told.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured and raped in August in prison.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a Kahrizak prison with 75 others more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the responses of the government to it, but Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would not have been clear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 persons were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a true mark into a competition point in Bristol.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the hang in the Brandon-Hill Park there was a short jumping booth at the beginning of a 100 meters long hang.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the peak of the hang, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices were awarded for the best works of art performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on the construction of Minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's declared most secularised societies — and to be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love head towels" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a dispute that the country shared and occupied over and a half decades and whose effects are still to be seen today.
Bowen's newest book offers a more comprehensive and chic range.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in this area.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he returns discussions between teachers and students on the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a townhouse?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly prosperous affairs, he claims, which make up everyday life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media are dealing with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imamens, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who Bowen interviewed are mostly unlike their salafs – defenders of the puristic Sunni Islam, which is related to Saudi Arabia – who today show a small, but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questioned the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guarded the separation of church and state) really felt committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a rough treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, for their part, had to make their historical compromise with the Secular Republicanism.
He recognizes rather a "enhancement of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The World’s Most Troubleous View
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that it marks melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can nowhere else survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have traveled into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their kielwater.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, writes in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural story of the icon of the North, the ice bear.
Immigrated in the complex history and politics of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic scientists who have proven themselves to hunt on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old ferry to the lake, who only fought with the gun piston of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught when they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circus.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo facilities still typically have a millionth of the life range of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore was completely green by the algae growing in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, landing in Greenland and Canada continues, where hunters in helicopters and motor-slit Inuit use powerful storm guns to bring their prey to track.
Ironically, in the waters of the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and worrying description of the Arctic's science and a packing insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century made it possible for the first time to suspect the confusion of the ice.
In the Cold War, underwater boats swept the shifting granate during the underground.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the wide range of measuring probes on ice mountains, but much is still achieved by unintimidated people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look into the strange, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by salt water rinses that are pushed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened by it once the summer ice passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us."
Marine fans were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kränze
The De'Angello Robinson, the top-liberated, travelled seven hours by bus to put a single crane on the tomb of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other Marine Infanterists who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in their steps.
In a few months, wherever we get back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Peaceyard.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, at the Fayetteville National Friedhof in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made a trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way to give back something to them that brought the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution on how we can support civilians.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Packed in wardrobes, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawn areas and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had the goal of older graves from the First and Second World War and Vietnam War, as they are not visited as often as the recent graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples kept their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the greyening tombstones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the ice air.
Some read the names in stone, while others bow down to small black-white square cards that had been placed for those in the wet mud whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who had bitter tears in front of the tomb of her son.
She traveled 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infrared Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell into battle in July.
Nobody should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government arrested a contractor from the US government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as USAID, the US authorities for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the United States interest in Havana are trying to obtain access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The special accusations have not yet been published, although Cuban law allows a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor to be arrested for almost everything, under the accusation of "risk".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government-fighted graffiti and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by the popular journalist Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasises that the United States will make a contribution when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often need to report their names to the government.
Too many websites have limited access.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind robbery for crimes like drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of US interest in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", a statement on the establishment of Raul Castro as leader of the country, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested, sentenced and detained very often within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries moved for more willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives reveal plans to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and they said that they hoped that this case could help to detect an extensive network of terrorist recruits seeking the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they had been looking for an intransparent insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had discovered them because one of them had commented on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video page.
After her arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to migrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargodha for days, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refugee.
They were considered to be part of a hidden operation.
Therefore they were rejected, said the government officer who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officer said that the men were not discouraged at all and continued to seek the right recommendations to get access to Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has made it extremely urgent to accommodate human assets within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as sponsors who do not enter those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American volunteer recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to lock someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators walked here through the streets on Saturday and called for more cunning action on climate protection by the negotiators in the Bella Congress Centre of the City.
demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more likely to be about 25 000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists fired small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
One day, when the climate negotiations promoted by the United Nations did little, thousands of activists wandered through the city with transparents, where in English "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some Stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, the birth country of her mother, makes her aware of what heart-breaking problems the country has to deal with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motive why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to extend the word and appeal to the world leaders to achieve a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way to go around.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or brought pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to a viewer who didn't want to be mentioned, as he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing ignited several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, and added that they started as a lighting rocket, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the awareness of the main operators, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international reflections, he replied in English: "That is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial gap
The evidence of mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools of the country that produce the highest achievements, the evidence shows that the fourth and eight-classers have made more progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of white four-year-olds from Washington D.C. increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African equal ages increased by only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, between 2007 and 2009 the power gap increased from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-classers remained basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not sufficient.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black four-classers in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262-202).
And even though the scores that children have reached both groups have increased in this period, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Some educational supporters of the district expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were driven by the majority of white students, who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have increased the overall valuation by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group for equality of education in Washington D.C..
I do not jump up and down for two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, which I respect.
But what scares me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
For example, this autumn some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which basic skills of reading have not been mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and lively experiences from the children's school to the sixth class, has been brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and some of the NAEP progress reported last week is attributed to this curriculum.
I think that we must continue to work to make the best measures beneficial to students below the ranking level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigated urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political repercussions against this important agenda item.
The weakness is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be assured that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the gap in performance is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the strength to change, said Janey, who with his teacher union last year came to an agreement over 185 days per year, which he considered as a "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg collection with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and flashes a moment when the white pillars, the tiles and the smaragd green lawn are seen.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, which was locked in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and those of the other eight-classers of the group, who explore the Gettysburg, where the lessons cost $38.690 a year, was rather the one of an apprehensive visitor than the one of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was reported the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken the intentional message completely: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the US of Spanish immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college training, which is needed to get up to the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generations" of Hispano-Americans concludes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrants, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing the high school.
Their success stories are important, says researchers, because they will show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to their success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of confidence with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts persist over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in searching through the system, a single measure will at any time not solve the problem," said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to consider providing for these children a supportive network from preschool to through high school.
The federal program financed by Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a gang upswitching - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programmes that start when low-income students are in high school and continue to run until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department for Education, the programme has been helping more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil concluded with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the ten auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly-seated representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After six years of war, Iraq finally opened its doors and instead of US companies gave the way to Asia and Europe,” said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still highlighted by massively coordinated bombardments on Tuesday, and political instability due to the deduction of the US military, American oil companies are likely to have stopped, said analysts to engage more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, in particular Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and rather take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been with technical advice over the past few years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to become one of the majors of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its partners and fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an apparent US rocket attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top-level planner of Al Kaida was reported to have been killed this week, according to the US terrorist fighters on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second fatal attack on a high terrorist officer this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, were expected to have been killed by a number of missiles who met their vehicle on Tuesday near Miran Shah City in the province of Northern Azerbaijan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official representative of a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah by phone.
Local residents who were suspected to be among the soldiers ran to the place and quickly took everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US fight against terrorism argued indefinite evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous and referred to the sensitive nature of the US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, this included planning attacks on the USA and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American government representative said that Somali had quickly risen in Al-Kaida Hierarchy and maintained best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official representative, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribe area and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to reduce their attackability while killing brutally suspected informants, the page reported.
UN leader ambassador in Kabul will resign
The UN leader in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office, which was disturbed by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential elections supported by the UN.
Eide's disappearance takes place when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN ambassador said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which would begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their troops.
We need to speed up the building of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, oaths said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The military force increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not settle his office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN.
Refer to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, oath said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, according to UN representatives, started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-single Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of prefering President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
The oath rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "unquestionably damaged the mission because there was already a great degree of scepticism about the international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance measures of the U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
The oath expressed his disappointment about the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the understandable United Nations regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are so designed that since May, he said I could only set up one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like that.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in discussions on his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day trip through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 U.S. soldiers in Northern Ireland and played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said in answer to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years that is the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama government is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect Iranian averages.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons", because "her people" will suffer enormously from sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume discussions on the limitation of its nuclear programme and abandon a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear timber for its medical research reactor.
The US government has insisted on this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- partly, experts say, because Iran's leadership disagrees about whether to commit to the United States.
Gates said that Iran simply left the international community with respect to some of the proposals which they had already agreed to in early October, openly saying, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, has brought together in a way that they were never in connection with major additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to follow other options, including those which Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "expressive sanctions".
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unfounded and unfunded claims" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said they were willing to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki before flying to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential of conflict to prevent delays in US plans to reduce the US force by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to dissipate Kurdish concerns about the coming retreat of troops. The US representative quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which held lectures to them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change the course this summer because of the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediately and definitive: "Non in any case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, deceased single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors", a population crisis in the country rises.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy entered into force,
The Department for Population issues is determined, while the number of population aged 60 and older in 2020 is expected to increase explosively from 16.7% of the population by 2050 to 31.1%. This is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate has been below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in prosperable age need to receive babies to "help to reduce the proportion of older people and to alleviate the shortage of labour in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
According to the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial provision that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous fines - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination in their workplace.
China's representatives have attributed this policy to avoiding critical demand for natural land resources, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policy.
In rural areas, some officials who already had a child have forced pregnant women to abide.
Many couples had also made gender-selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they accepted more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives recently even discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples two children with a single child partner.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city to start an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that detailedly describe who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent urban staff and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and send information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that an upturn in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still submitted per month.
Disappointed Shanghain officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the village of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want children anymore.
She said they wanted to give their first one the best.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 said that they would like to have two children, and that was also permitted by law.
But, like many Chinese, they only own a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely judge one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff manager, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not accustomed to caring for others and do not really want this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old to whom a translation company belongs, said it unblowered.
For middle-aged parents with a double career through which the rate of birth decreases, he said that it turns around to be successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, poses huge requirements for the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to experience this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UN Group drafts Emissions Reduction Plan
The UN-promoted climate conference, which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations, has once again put an emphasis on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations having to shake the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on greenhouse gases, has identified both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered to be an important step forward in a negotiation that is about to take place, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specific UN working group for this purpose, silences the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can manage global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature increases that policy-makers would be involved.
The process is given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, the leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative Yvo de Boer called the "great whole".
It shows the fundamental horizon of a possible agreement in which industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also provided a boost to the talks on Friday through its assurance that over the next three years, US$3.6 billion per year will be provided to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from flooding and drought to avoiding deforestation.
However, Friday brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the conversations last week.
The American Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries if they are not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as a representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without increasing emerging countries and taking measures, so Star, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Star gave his opinion an hour after the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei's statement, which said that the leading American climate dealer either lacked "the reason" or it was "most irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help China to cope with global warming.
As the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, breaking lines have been opened both within the industrial nations and between industrial nations and emerging countries.
The current struggle also refers to the rescue of individual economies as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States obeying their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting for who should bear the costs of broeikasemission brakes, since even affected countries were more aggressive in making the countries with a very high greenhouse gas levy accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who runs the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states "exercises political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The discussions got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be resolved before the leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, departed from their planes and ran through the Bella Center halls to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to seal claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13.000 people enter and exit daily at the congress centre, guitar-playing activists organize night shows where they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling themselves, and draft contracts are hand-to-hand rather than e-mailing -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just growing: Almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of Global Policy of the Organisation Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the feeling of Monday
On Monday morning at 5:00 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach London St. Pancras 225 km/h on its flash trip from Ashfort, Kent, and reach 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then Lady Kelly Holmes will travel on board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect faster, reliable trains to an international rail network and connect the large districts of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced and switching from plane and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and road staves.
In theory, the three large parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network that could still stop inevitable planning battles and fears of environmental damage in the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, says that Lord Adonis will submit the report on December 30.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass with a five-metre space to urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open space, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be divided in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes compared to today a little more than an hour.
The drafts would allow trains to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first track was designed to allow 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would, in turn, mean that in London a terminal would be needed, where 20,000 travellers could be finished per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the long-lasting public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed tracks to existing rail tracks in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered to be a crucial clash point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the train, a guide for the rail revolution.
Tax payers are charged for mortgage for 75,000 pound orangerie of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orangery he read to build in his home in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, degraded by David Cameron because he complained that underhouse members had to live "of mager rationalities", increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build a oak wood plant at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
At the time, the underhouse officials approved the applications and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a check of the expenditure of the underhouse members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest underhouse members, has a two-storey house in a village in its constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a expenditure control station of the underground house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "orange" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Even during a recent investigation of its previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, Duncan was not asked to comment on increased cash collection.
The Committee released him from breaking the rules last month after an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of more than 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, one year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest refund until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the cash acquisition of GBP 75,000 (€ 85,000).
The normal gradual RBS mortgage interest fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the lower house show that this May Duncan continued to claim his right to $1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the underhouse in September, after a undercover reporter filmed him when he, after the edition scandal, said that Members of Parliament would live "of mager rationalities".
"In essence it means working for the state that you have to live by subtle rations and how S******e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I have the right to a small part of it, measured by what belongs.
And I could've asked for the whole fucking sum, but I won't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as a oil wholesaler, was attacked for his expenses for the first time in May when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could "be regarded as an exaggerated claim".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist digged a hole in the form of a pound mark after it had become known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was interviewed yesterday night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and then by Legg for an increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate on evasion and swinging, or a bogus of rules or similar things.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer."
Come to admire all their believers Brighton's beach huts Advent calendar
Beach cottages in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st, and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 pm with free fluorescent wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs currently selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Christmas", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary priest of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why as a church we expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have carried out several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion which could enter into force from 2013 on Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, increasing global mobilization for the climate contributes to illustrating these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, had broken shovels with plaster stones and hamsters, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your opinion mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, have been arrested in eastern France, in April, at the NATO Summit.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has strongly criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers had been arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of you "on Saturday evening were kept in the streets" despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting positions.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the planned speakers for an evening with candle light, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators traveled from the major European cities with beetles and trains, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, and some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue blue rain coats, made a first show in the morning in Copenhagen, as you followed the call from the friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for the "Climate Justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand a compensation for environmental debt in favour of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on that way and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry, watercourse where you can walk, as has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, the form of globalisation critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable as a result of the warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
According to the Australian organizers, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students who were marching in red and hosted bandanas in which you celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, there were some hundred demonstrators calling for an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered some hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (Nord), Bordeaux (Western) and Lyon (Eastern).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abchasia has elected its president, Georgia denounced that it is a "strife" here.
Abchasia chose his president on Saturday, which happened a bit more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as an independent one, denounced Tbilisi the "strike".
Approximately 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control over the South-Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed GMT at 5 p.m.
The election participation was about 58% a few hours before the election was closed, according to the Abchasian election commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemns the election.
These elections are a Farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets the fact that Abchasia is now under russical total occupation, has declared his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world sees it as a part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After it was separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, several thousands of people died, Abchasia wants to prove, through this election, its willingness to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electorates who chose to choose in a election room in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who came to monitor the election.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an indication of Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abchasian independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, responded Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, on its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements reached with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in which Abchasia leaves the railway control for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the buyhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to operate, have arrested about 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries, looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre and did not attempt to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for an evening with candle light, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were dressed in black and armed with baking stones and hemmers began to hit discs, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest policemen have immediately circumcised you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury by a patch stone in the chin during the incidents where, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have control over the extreme groups," said the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces circled in the air.
Most demonstrators traveling by train or by their own vehicle from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue rain jacket, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the Friends of the Earth to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to the people of the south," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves anymore: we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that sink, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and the critic for globalisation, José Bové, said to the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "bind climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the struggle against global warming and the struggle for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of the organizers, about 50,000 people went to the street.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, have made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippines capital for solar energy.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
During the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", several hundred people joined together in France, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview that appeared in the Sunday journal "Journal du dimanche", the National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history were reinforced by the school reform of the Lycées, even if they were not made compulsory in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the first (11th school year) now have every four week hours and the same program," says Chatel.
For the Minister "must be overcome this hypocriticality", because he said "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, in general, a concentration "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientist," he continued, stressing, "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have resented the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical Lyceens."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the government project to delete compulsory teaching in history and geography in terminals S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question about a restriction of the philosophy of the S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which in their opinion was the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they were subjected to a professional qualification examination at the beginning of the year at Master 2 (M2) and at the end of the year of an approval examination, in which their teaching skills were examined.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will reach even more hours that you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a " thing that does not exist in people's education."
He again confirmed that he wanted to abolish the school card "to 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Superiore"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the engagement at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences at which experts, each 15 minutes with filmed contributions, turn to the audience.
One wants to do something that makes people reach and in them feel like they want to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event is based on the name the students gave the fish in the school basin.
"The experts were selected around the twenty participants in the discussion, even after their charisma," he clarified.
"We can talk about climate warming for hours. But the core goals can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely about 50 people before only using film.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that listeners might learn that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos from these conferences will be available online on the school page from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will then take place every two months.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of criminal officers called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was postponed for budgetary reasons until January will be transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of law enforcement officers ("FO-Penitentiaire") called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate before the law enforcement institute on Tuesday morning and to block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to".
The 3rd union of criminal officers ("CGT-Penitentiaire") called for "to unite itself to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of overtimes, night surcharges and sun and holiday surcharges in October becomes "shameful and unacceptable" market in December.
The first union of criminal officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Tribunal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The management of the Penal Court and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime in 2009 increased considerably and not all were planned in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the unions of criminal officers to ensure that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to maintain and modernize our criminal system," the Minister of Justice in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the Penal Court to take immediate measures to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen in the future by a lack of assessment of the surpassing hours, is not repeated," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore thin, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille resents itself and announces to boycott "all meetings and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff will not go to work on Sunday and holidays if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtime," threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being charged to us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," said Bordeaux's CGT trade union.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama is of the opinion that he distributes Christmas always better gifts than he receives himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has argued with TV Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he will always distribute better gifts than he himself gets.
At a special show broadcast on Sunday evening over the channel ABC, the President and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama decided to reject her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necklines the president.
"So please," he swore she silly and pointed to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you these?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an uncomfortable atmosphere with the well-known TV moderator, which Barack Obama had so vigorously supported during his election campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-course bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Not much later in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The first lady, for her part, remembered her puppet house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL confirms that he was transferred to artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was transferred to artificial coma in order to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated in the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday after the American doctors had found "injures due to the operation of a band disc accident" he had suffered in Paris on November 26th, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have required a reoperative operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical advice would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, only after 48 hours was a little more certain about the patient’s condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was neither confirmation nor comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" has been "no drainage" after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a band disc incident.
The surgery planned for several days was carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments on RTL on Thursday night.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was sent to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a deep valley. However, he assured that "no worries" need to be made to the rock musician because this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left Los Angeles. I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane 12 hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is confined".
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health has increased since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general astonishment, Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer operative", resulting in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer started his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer on stage has been trying to move.
Only in mid-November had the people surrounding him to demente a re-entry to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Curzbahn: First place for Bousquet via its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, took an international title on his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, on which polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m by the men.
Damage for Bousquet, who wanted to grab after the world record at 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in swimming, 50m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 seconds, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not succeed in breaking the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever bigger and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Orders since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination this time has not been paid for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and World Order, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has spent the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA : Estimated tomb plate at Zola at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at 1.5 million US dollars over their value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm tall. It comes from the third century after Christ and was always rated with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysos are presented in a socialist architecture decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President of Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of the money so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola is far backwards.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her Paris hotel bathroom and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "herb of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon Macquartet".
Zelaya's attempt to get out of Honduras towards Mexico has been ruined
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for transferring the crashed Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as incompatible, after that lead had been rejected by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation held at night with President Zelaya, at the moment everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer," said the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane submitted by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to its place of departure.
The Putsch government wanted Mr. Zelaya to "abstain" and asked him for political asylum abroad under guidance.
However, the cast President refused this because he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming head of State.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a further failure by trying to move me to give up on my expense (...), they wanted me to leave," said on Thursday Mr. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken to speak since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and like to stay for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen President, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under some agreements.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for guidance to us, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include an asylum request, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, explained to the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, he would only be the president of the Honduran people.
The rumours about a departure M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the followers of the crashed President, who had opened up to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and the military there had strengthened its efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached Venetian Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been crashed on 28 June, on the day of the public consultation organised by him to prepare his reelection, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
He returned surprisingly from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21st and fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
He leaves this, he is detained for high treason, which he is accused of by the justice, according to the coup government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November in order to redeem Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States during the contested election, but by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil had been rejected.
Three days later, the Cogress had massively voted against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until his term of office expired on 27 January.
Wall Street in the rise, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, the figures of the US trade balance show a price recovery of the US shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has spent 0.67%, the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the figures on stock exchange closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was registered with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from different industries,” said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotically under the pretext that the market is only focused on "half glasses", so it reduced.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily set to the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
On the other hand, the analysts had expected an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, reflecting the economic growth of the major trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell from Business Research Economy.com.
On the other hand, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks the average value of new job seekers "was at the bottom of the year", Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of public bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482 % compared to 3.432 % from Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492 % compared to 4.408 % from the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of power-in-powered partisans pipe out "Ladies in Whites"
On Thursday, some hundreds of the Cuban-powered partisans swept out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, and also swept another announcement, which resulted in the temporary arrest of a good dozen dissidents.
Forty "Women in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, were swept out on the open street of the government's partisans under Raul Castro, just when they were on the footstep into the center of the city to demand the release of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Lower with the Yankies!, "Solders!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There are Fidel and Raul living!", the authorized partisans with raised faust scanned against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "provide their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Women in Weiss" had taken place in Havana the night before, in which neither wounded nor arrested were found.
On the other hand, in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents, who also took up a demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, a reporter of the AFP confirmed.
The police have, according to this journalist, forced the dissidents of the government to enter civilian vehicles under violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited only to a few hours.
As candidates for the Saharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "please request the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the Dissidents list has about 200 persons," said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents who were detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been behind grids until then.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "solders" or "agents" in the service of the declared archbishop, the United States.
A rarity in itself is the fact that Cuban television started a report on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contrerevolutionary" reports.
Cuba led by a Unity Party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insane kills eighty years with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An insane armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the late afternoon of Friday and wounded five more people.
According to the first information of the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had wounded the eighty-year-old from unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy at the Jean-Jaures Boulevard with two knives and this, corresponding to police information, with the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a responsible officer of the Alliance Police Syndicat at the hospital, was responsible for the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he tricked a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, approximately in the Trinity, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims were seriously injured to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is at risk of life, as he, according to police sources, apparently had been affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become bad as a result of the events and she is supposed to have been hospitalized in the "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence according to police information, should immediately have escaped on the road, the equal Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have wounded two more Passengers, apparently by chance: a Thirty- and a Forty-year-old, with the latter of both difficult.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives that he wore crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance Syndicat of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passagers, including young people, according to the AFP’s witness reports, are supposed to have tried to plunder the insane.
I saw a guy in the Trinity with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waitress of a nearby bar.
A horn fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
On the boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the number 61, two city police officers, including their superiors, have tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with knife sticks, according to police information.
The event has been played in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old lying on the floor, I brought them to the first-aid opinion and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach," said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacy, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cut wounds.
The military forces of the state police finally arrested the man who did not carry any ID documents.
Nanterre's Attorney General has commissioned the District Office of the Hauts-de Seine Criminal Police (SDPJ 92).
The mad man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his state, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude that he is sent to a nervous treatment facility.
According to another police source, six police officers were forced to bundle him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of excitement" like "all spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces become free during the tather process".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for re-enactment of the prosecution
The attorney of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called for the prosecution of his client, who is currently at his place of residence in Switzerland because of a moral delinquency of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney to the director of the "Pianist", accused three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California of serious procedural errors at the time of negotiation in 1977.
I call for sentences on the spot, said Mr. Hummel, before he added that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was commissioned at the time of the trial with the case, "was running down a cold back".
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who was now dead, before he fell his judge's plea, had discussed with a prosecutor who should have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and wanted), specifically by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, Mr. Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentary had "beloogt".
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for the conduct of a trial which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentation.
The accusation, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the charges charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the United States in 1978 before the sentence was declared for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years old.
He hasn't traveled to the United States since then.
The Deputy Attorney-General of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski had to "be there to attend the trial".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused who are a way out?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In her view, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and therefore disregards his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even stressed that "there were other escape alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the cessation of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the revocation of the criminal proceedings.
She reminded her client that it would no longer end up being insulted by any resurrection of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to a possible extradition to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange ended without a price on Friday in a market between better indicators than in the United States and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has scored 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Fairly speaking, the market is quite quiet," Mace found look silver by Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that this will remain so by the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "has contributed to improving market views on the solidity of economic recovery", summarised the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus two months in a row and much more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers improved significantly in December, at 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index forecast.
However, the index was braked by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level in relation to the euro for the past two months, pushing 'the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation downwards'," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the 10-year tax bond increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482% on 30-year bonds, to 4.497% on 4.492% of the previous day.
Choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World title will surpass the last obstacle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and this before a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already reached their ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were awarded Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasures.
Beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn were simply exceptional.
I have seen many things and made many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone said with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (15 a.m. Central European time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a nicer country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russin, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "awesome landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws in Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is emphasised with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional paintings and not to forget in bathing suits.
The performance is presented by a television moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a Miss World Committee leader, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is white to receive the world with a hardly overburdening heart and pride, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
As last year, the candidates made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they cost the bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with the South African president Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was exceptional.
Not usually for a Head of State, said Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'll probably never get near.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promised enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been there in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything goes very well, said David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.M.) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go to the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï, where Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation at a band disc event on November 26th.
"This night in Los Angeles, the singer was transferred to an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and to perform his treatment," announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a band disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to reoperate during the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event at the French gymnasium in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, noted a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hospital of Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles said they were completely disappointed," said Mr. Camus.
I've heard that you might be going to initiate a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "was far too fast and travelled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I telephoned with this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which was very surprised, because I myself already had two band disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he told RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had performed the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, in which he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated with Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematom after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, who has already been sentenced several times for misleading operations and not to be forgotten, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Chamber, called him "a man without scrupules" who has to be "regular" before the board and "all other things are recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have arisen since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is too scarce for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens)," said Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) becomes vigorous and urges the New Centre Party not to use its seal anymore
The Party Alliance, supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, responded vigorously on Friday to a attempt to take over the seal, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by Hervé Morin, President of the New Centre Party, and urged him to no longer use that seal on any document under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given the left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
He had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC) who claimed the right to the property of the brand UDF, since he first applied for the brand at the Institute national de la propriété industrielle in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF Party Alliance, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and clearly understood that they were not dismissed and set a deadline to the Minister and the MEP, under the threat of judicial persecution, to no longer use this seal and transfer the property rights of the brand.
In recent days you have made numerous explanations that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, the Party Alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +New centre+, the slogan + today's UDF+, on its political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, UDF's business office stated and urges the NC party to "remove the name UDF shortly from all material and from its website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was asked "to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal rights".
If you refuse this, we will lodge a complaint against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasise that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and recalls that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to set up a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002 to set up the "UMP" party.
According to the signatories, the Nouveau Centre Party therefore has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "he was not a member of the UDF but the UMP for three years at the time he applied for the brand name.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to perform this for himself.
You also note that this ignorance is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems more desirable for us in politics as well as in life to make ourselves a name instead of trying to get out of anonymity by deceptively acquiring a name on which you have no legal rights."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to find out whether, as the daughter of the Milliardary Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds in order to swallow some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness in court, an offence punished with a maximum of three years of liberty and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this case, which is worthy of Saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are fetching themselves and at the same time have the studs of the Cosmetic Empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also commissioned a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down during the investigations by the Nanterre Attorney General.
The doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which you will clearly state whether and at what times Liliane bedencourt may have found itself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I will speak to her, explained Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
With regard to the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal prosecution against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accuses him of having exploited the weakness of her mother for years to make donations of a billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For your part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refrained from being manipulated by the photographer who she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a great family debacle on Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called himself on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she mistrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier one to two times a day for fifteen years.
Françoise I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Nanterre Attorney General reiterates its view that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because a guardian's judge has refused to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother in the last few days.
Liliane bedencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in its place," confirmed the representative of the Attorney General, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the proceedings for the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers have taken place.
Manager Revolution or the end of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff joining "values" determines the best, as it was previously designed to impose on consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By giving the customer in the centre of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately impose factors preferences of customers regularly again!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides of France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&Eund, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economie = Economic Intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach" from all parties involved; it calls for a commitment from the employees that is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution that would consist of placing the employees at the centre of the company's concerns equal to the customers.
The very conducive benefit of internal opinion polls
Will internal polls, like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its payees, encourage this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could find that, in the face of a new situation, after many shifts, the whole structure finally managed to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
Previously from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory that has recently been reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unconsciously widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a current survey by Ipsos, which has been published by Le Figaro.fr, strengthens the leadership in a position towards a mechanical control system that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol into any thinking or practice of governance: for the payees, commitment for the company is only possible if it appears to be a clear means to achieve part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a specified doxa, which allows them to assess through their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and place their human resource management back at the right place.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is beneficial for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday the evening before, and was pleased that the 2009 Peace Nobel Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had ridiculed the award to Obama on 9 October applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-Presidentship candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican party in the newspaper USA Today, and added that she himself had raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her just published memoirs.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars by his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way of explaining his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the President had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, gladly the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt this speech entirely historical," Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former MEP, who was considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "left president" reminding the Nobel Committee members that they were "not free and could not give a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does", he "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans "are living in a safety bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a fake of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as " boring, high-night and inspirationless".
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can simply justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praiseworthy on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded early to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "is a roadmap for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", says the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Remote drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures delivery to Christmas
After a three-week bargaining marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organization who remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening, which puts an end to the strike order and the threat of severe supply shortages at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated in the hope of signing the agreement quickly on the late morning.
And that even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and of 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now asked not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF president Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement" although it was " difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human mind and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs, as well as for maintaining the overall road transport set in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the 13th month's salary to be addressed and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes on employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of a government amendment on the 2009 bill on corrected finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly during the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for a "identified" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then, in the case of extension by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be "in the shortest time" the case, Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The United Nations Association (UNTR) promoted a "fraud trade" because the EUR 100 million " were already promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to drown the gossip eaters on the next Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry to grave a big grave in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions discontent with the proposals of the RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest highway network in France for the Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting was held on Friday, the second day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris passenger transport administration), which lets strikers with their demands for wage increases continue to wait.
On this important shopping week before Christmas no trains took place between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central track (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central track only one of four trains was ready to operate.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travellers to move.
The shop chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the major business in transport technology".
The RER A line passes the Paris district from west to east.
The RATP section connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost none during the poor traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the train as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had set themselves to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnastics.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he would have risen extra "a half an hour earlier to get to work in time".
The SNCF, which had planned to support travellers by staff and orders, pointed out that there had been no shortcomings at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the station Saint-Lazare to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed which the associations after the meeting with the leader's head had classified as "dusty" on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. Thierry Garon (Sud) says they demand a long-term salary supplement.
The CGT was upset by the fact that the RATP itself put its wage bonus proposals in brackets and stressed that the leader's peak "is unable to solve a problem, while this was possible for the long distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was scheduled for Monday to be held on "complete examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "misses the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 riders visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leader's point that, until then, refused any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming situation.
On Tuesday the conflict threatened to extend to the line RER B after an announcement by Usa and Independents.
The associations require an increase of 120 euro (Unsa) to 150 euro, of which 30 euro are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of the working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of €2200 to €2.700 as well as an additional salary of €600 to €650 for shift services as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision followed immediately by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate enormously the work of the government, which seeks to give hands to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been taking place for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "feet for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution.He also pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political process for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoying Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed their views before the ruling that parliamentarians would prefer to leave Parliament rather than meet as partial parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the Attorney-General of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused DTP of following the Kurdistan Worker Party's (PKK) instructions, which were considered by Ankara and many other countries as an organisation of terrorism.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political window of PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court works between the government, which seeks to respond to the Kurdish community and propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to allow the support of the PKK to be sealed by the Kurds and to put an end to conflicts.
The DTP leaders reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a re-eruption of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to collisions with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP premises in the million city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, mainly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas grenades and water throwers when the demonstrators began to throw Molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Turkey assumed that the court's decision would "defence will further deepen".
"Turkey cannot answer this question (Curdish, note-writing) on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We object in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said Ahmet Island, a political market observer.
"You can obviously get caught by a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack where seven soldiers died in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow breaking can come
A really cracky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, says the Winter Service Manager of the FES.
Especially so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be so far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
Once it is snowy in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-strikes are drove off with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighter access, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and distances with gaps, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins at 3:00 a.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours, if necessary, with moisture salt, which is better responsible.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "which means that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It'll be hard if it's not snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is willing to place the scattered vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are feeding and opening roads, including the Council-Beil-Straße, on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, knows Brauburger.
At 5 p.m. in the morning, the FES's pedestrians are on their way, risk points and transitions are first and foremost cleared.
The FES is usually unable to take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22:00 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
As there is on this fast smoothness, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the stretch is on the road.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The weights of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two-metre and 1.50-metre animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sparkling claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday magazine Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was at the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began a funeral at Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports Team member Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
During the excavation they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun God of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional finding: "Dinosaurier fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only single fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular is this discovery not, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, so the allocation of these original dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the exes split up into their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropods, later the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged saropods and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischia (Vogelbeckensaurier), among which the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus included.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found signs of air bags, as they also own the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine appear to be partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge Sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the common foreheads of both groups probably had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the primitivest known dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the exes appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all the continents that at the time formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropodes.
The three cannot originate from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonnian palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give rise to a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dino fossils have been preserved, while there is hardly anything to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Middle Ages, it is still ridiculous.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the airsauriers and with many other exes.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border of the Trias to the Jura died.
Success Story didn't last forever
There are two assumptions to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs randomly survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story didn't last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion of a group of animals, which had also developed in the tria and since then a schattendasein has been delayed: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto insist on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino at the Frankfurter Goethe University beats waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidarity with the protesting students at the campus Westend.
In a statement made in German and English, they were "inadmissible" to the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been smashed.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, judged by the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers through a police command".
The evasion constitutes a "inadmissible intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitization and criminalization of the protest" and defers from the contents.
The Bureau has withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupyers did not support the material damage, it says.
Protest warranted
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union union also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future," says Verdi-Land Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister for Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), however, defended the action of the Uni President and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the United States.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to CDU Land Day Member Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups SPD, Green and Left saw this.
The CDU takes painted walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they were cleared.
The left has tabled an application calling on the Minister of Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, she was considered a secret city, unaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a highly guarded site in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurter Wissenschaftsstandort Riedberg - with the University Institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed the planning center Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research centre will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to enter orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (written translated "Green City") received his name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart brake clotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be applied sufficiently high.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the deepening of a train station, more than a monstrous construction project that will crash the city of the Baden-Wurtemberg Land capital for a decade in heillose construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, main railway stations ending in the middle of the city were regarded as 19th-century transport fossils, which acted as brake clutters of modern rail transport, as it once took enormous amount of time to reverse locomotives from back to forward.
Get in, stay short, go on - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that is why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is approximately halfway from the trans-European railway Magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that is the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost ineligible in the Hesse and the Bavarian city to implement the deepening.
However, the main railway stations also have no problem with entry and exit since there are modern turn trains with motor vehicles and drivers at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 in addition to the ICE new construction track to Ulm is now under way.
National and local politicians have implemented it.
The train is also involved because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project of the Republic bear the taxpayers and not the state group.
The project is still in some way justified by urban development.
There is a new city space, which - believed to be the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which was typically attributed to huge growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was not yet the competition of cheap airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than by road trucks.
But the new construction track does not fall for freight trains because of heavy slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly tangents many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros are to be banned in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is true that in the next decade the money will be missing at other node points and narrow points in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the more than 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 it has been built on the road in the tempo.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake bulb.
The Rhine Valley is becoming a bottleneck for international freight transport, in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The state government has left open at the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into review against the judgment of the Hessische Verwaltungsgerichtshof (VGH).
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the VGH judgment on more than 400 pages legally, said Dieter Posch (FDP) Minister for Economic Affairs.
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had reasoned in writing that in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Landebahn at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-order the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m. as provided for by the national government is not compatible with the protection of the public from night air noise provided by law.
The coalition has to decide by 4 January whether it is going against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government representatives to refrain from reviewing the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Head of the SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise this would be considered a "word break".
It's fucking hard to keep his word," Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election logan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation by Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government was trying to come to their night flights with "right-draining and tricking".
A thorough legal examination requires their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban would never have been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis shaken U.S. big banks strip their state ties off.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America returned aid from the Tarp Bank Saving Fund to a total of 45 billion dollars (around 30 billion euros).
And also the Citigroup, following a report from the US broadcaster CNBC, plans to refund State aid.
The institutions want to remove the limitations associated with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had provided more than 19 billion dollars of fresh money to investors about change bonds.
The rest of the sum she took from her own cash, which was well filled, among other things, by Sparten sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: the money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen at the peak of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market to be exempted from its debts to the State.
Even on Thursday, the US bank could announce a heavy increase of around 20 billion dollars in its capital, CNBC reported on circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
Well, then everything went faster than I thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the chief editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was the favourite.
However, there was no official confirmation from the broadcaster in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role in not further harming ZDF-intendent Markus Schächter, if this proposal does not go through with the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of the editorial process of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a predecessor's defeat, but an expected defeat.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had signaled weeks before the election that they would not wish to confirm Brender in office.
Organised was the opposition to the chief editor of Hesse Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF's messages had lost to switch-in ratios, he refused another term of office of the highly renowned chief editor.
So until shortly before the election, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was cast.
Lastly, even 35 state judges had been involved in the debate, which considered Kochs' approach to be unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To Person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and novelism.
Afterwards he worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, first to the "day-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 Personal Referent of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Head and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the selection of Brenders, which was still elected to be a journalist by the industry magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Kochs disagreed with the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that staff proposals from the instructor cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck was also excluded from the ZDF's supervisory bodies.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a clever chess-treat - by criticizing the panel very strongly immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate shatters without losing his face for the post of chief editor and to choose the board without being suspicious of hiring a party gang.
In party arithmology, Frey is at least attributed to the left-liberal.
Studies Detroited
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally instructed on Thursday: at a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and the Rectors Conference of Universities, both sides agreed to improve the terms of their studies at Bachelor and Masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable measure" ensured.
Policy and universities also want to simplify recognition of qualifications between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making joint structures for Bachelor's and Master's degrees more flexible.
In addition, there should be no country rules derogating from this.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university directors have been wearing the winged word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to reduce the number of examinations in part drastically: "Every module usually concludes with only one examination", it is stated in a 30-page paper to re-regulate the admission of study courses in part.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden", the accreditation council president Reinhold Grimm stated, the aim would be to stop "feal development which significantly impeded the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" is to be "the crucial criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "required to check" whether "necessary participations by students in the selection of the
Events would be avoided.
Students would have "advocate to have room for flexibility that enables and promotes their own initiative".
The rules are intended to apply to the admission of new, but also to the review of existing studies.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, but this means that it will take until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
In this respect, ten national accreditation agencies are responsible under the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had urged the countries to "reasonably" influence the agencies so that the filling of substances is not too large and the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the Ministry of State on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz has allocated additional funding for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, universities are mainly designed to set up tutorial programmes and to strengthen study counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novelty of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After this, only one examination should be required for the completion of a study model.
Studies are designed to become more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications in other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all studies of the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso High School Groups called for the future development of education policy to be stopped by "closed doors" of the ministers and higher education directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students should now also "speak a word" as concerned.
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with which the HRC discussed a joint reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough with Bonn's overall decisions: it demands a legal claim that allows each graduate with a Bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that the present generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient Master's degree courses with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, says Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Executive Board.
The countries need to recruit significantly more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not express their views on more free access to the master.
More than one footnote about Herta Müller
Going into Germany and out is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this in disruptive speeches discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literature awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He took care of considerable extraliterary attention last Tuesday at a meeting in Munich, where he referred to "German literature in Romania in the mirror and in the mirror of its securitisation acts".
Söllner apparently uncertains and postpones a statement in which he admitted his cooperation as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service of Securitate, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner had received the German language award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have begun slimly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not fought enough against the intimidation attempts of the securitates."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary discussion with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literature scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that highlights the abyss and the deception of a political system based on monitoring and spears.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate act, IM Walter had played a role, according to the confession of Söllner of literature scientist Michael Markel, and pointed out the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "hurt him out" in all of the difficult points for him at that time, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Secret Service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
In some cases, the people concerned may be speculated and have also known what clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the fact that Stasi acts are now very prosecutive, the management of the securitity supervision is still very widespread.
Systematic information has been harassed and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the relevant National Council for the Development of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the issue of the files has since been rather slow.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that regulates the administration of the files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, an interview in which a former Securitate Director from Temesvar reluctantly commented on the winner.
She's got a psychosis, but she's only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner is linked to inevitable questions, as so often related to hidden guilt.
Why only now? Who has been injured? The silly reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession is hoping that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for knowledge rather than by debt and shame.
To the Genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed like there was just an adrett dressed foreign serviceman from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports article manufacturer had distributed Goodies when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, climbed a quarter after midnight into a C-class.
The man with the marking glatze was chauffed because of the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game at last, and drunk before happiness was the 55-year-old as little.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work is going on.
Or just get started.
In the words of the first Swiss committed three days earlier: "We have reached the Eightth Final", i.e. in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blurred by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the declining."
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in the league everyday life in Mainz.
And stop the completely rediscovered weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Explosion
The Eighth Final of the Champions League (February 16, 17th + February 23, 24th) will be released in Nyon on December 18th.
So the joy of the fulminant stand of the Babbel follower remained.
Not only was it the supposed healer who had conveyed confidence, willingness and joy to the unsafe Stuttgart professional in the short time.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and have stopped them to be more courageous, Seelenklempner Gross explained the so simple sounding success recipe, which had no longer been effective under Therapeut Babbel.
He has developed some magic, Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann admits, "when a new impulse comes in football sometimes happens things that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, began to be the best player in the square after weeks of injury, tried to describe the observed "phenomen" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the operation of the new superior: "He is a man who persecutes and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the present situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously failed.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs constance, however.
Like Gross, players and managers were also cautious of overvaluing the victory against a weakened and completely overdemanded defence of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came, Khedira gave to think.
And sports board Horst Heldt advised that although one seasonal goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that hero was not ready to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after his first home victory for three months, was the events of the weekend, which were fresh in the form of a television interview that was broadcast immediately before the game was held by Torhuter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that the others make and not the Jens, the hero countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of directors of weaknesses and decided to change trainers on pressure of puberty fans.
Also that his free day had been removed after games, Lehmann considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann's statements were "scheduled by pure selfishness", Heroed back and announced consequences for the final man.
You're probably not gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work done by the dissolved trainer team, the playful and strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-fight in weight
Hot duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson provoked again and again world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight title according to the WBC version.
The judges' judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in weight.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the WBC version, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.o. that everyone was expecting did not work.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional struggles, he had to give himself two times because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Around 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
However, the eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the battles of the world champion, so Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights into the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats hit the world champion rarely.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had taken care of some vertebraes before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a ugly zombie, who can't do anything right.
When weighing, the champion was then provoked to push Johnson's glasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had to leave unfighted before.
This year he forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in his title defenses.
I only got one blow in this fight and I'm physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
But the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2,13 meters large Nikolai Waluiew in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a battle planned for September against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
It is alleged that his promotional company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
Frontalan attack from the opposition: Head of the Green Group Jürgen Trittin has called Minister of Defence Guttenberg a liar for false information on the Kunduz case.
SPD and left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings of Kunduz's air attack, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has been subjected to conscious deception.
The Minister said to the deadly bombardment on two tank load trains of September "aware of the intrusion", said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's called landing, he lied.
The order to kill had been given in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that the NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it had become known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped trucks, but also about the target killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, the US air attack requested by German Customer Commander Colonel Klein had killed or injured up to 142 people.
Greens, SPD and Left asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to comment immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor, Federal Defence and Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greenen-College Renate Künast called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office did not influence the concrete efforts of the Federal Defence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the presentation by the Ministry of the reasons for the redundancies of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert were also raised.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the tank loader attack.
Officially it had been said that they denied the existence of NATO reports and kept sensitive details to the Minister.
However, from the surroundings of the two senior officials, they reported that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-sided document of Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is expected to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the "Frankfurt General Sunday Magazine".
He has not received an answer so far, it says.
The Ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Day Investigation Committee, which will be set up on Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's okay.
When we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can devote ourselves to the wildest imaginations and imagination formations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, at least special.
But such images and voices arise not only in the case of mentally ill or drug abuse.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, insanity and reality blurred.
Dream-like changes in alertness can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case wakeness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mysticist Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic withdrawal states, psychoses and hallucinations can be based on similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal transmitters of the brain - above all dopamin, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholin - is disrupted and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him anymore
The relationship of wakeness and dream has been occupied by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of a dream in a vigilant state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great similarity of the insanity with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all incoherences, delusions, sensations of such."
It was autumn 2001, when Henning T. turned into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged devil shapes with blood red, distorted frosts, teething.
They hunt him, stack him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, malicious voices drone from walls and radio.
He can't bear them anymore, the voices that scourge and insult him.
Henning T. cuts two cables out of the stereo system, sticks them to a snake and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He rises to a loudspeaker and lays the snake around his neck.
Run.
The snake dissolves.
That should be a lesson for you, the voices scream in the drumming choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself heal!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoide psychosis, also he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease for three years, he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The cheating images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people can usually no longer distinguish between internal and external worlds, they are in an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The person concerned can no longer separate important from insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Doctor of the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University Clinic.
The schizophrenia is at the centre of the event, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, as in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot make them active.
Schizophrenia therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them; the deceptions are cruel reality, waking up.
Once in life having experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
The fabulous thoughts and hallucinations were in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain hits caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptions can lead to a short-term loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic indication of schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in the affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there is still a mystery as to how the neuronal system disorders occur, which are not manifested for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain goes hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what, says Erich Kasten, Professor of Psychology of Lübeck.
It is often only a question of the position whether or not misleading images are found to be pleasant or unpleasant.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and misleading appearances for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying events of psychoses, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions the brain of healthy people itself hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to boxes, are composed of memory holdings, which are normally held back.
They arise when brainreals, in which perceptions are processed, are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain is running hot or even if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But it's just also an excitement, stress, love tragedy or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents reported that they had experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the gymnasium.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break, it may happen that a slim boy with long, dark hairs speaks to it.
If it answers him, the fellow students look at it surprised - no one else sees or listens to this boy.
They think the shy girl is a shy day dream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other cheating images aren't real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly scary
Often the cheating images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can't sometimes follow the teaching material, because the teacher presents a new fellow student in her eyes and ears, while she explains mathematical equations to all others on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes too rarely and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures she sees, the frosts or the girl with the bloody cut wounds on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them about them, they would think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Last year she passed a college and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wohn is also an artwork of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from anxiety, he probably has hallucinations after a while," says Box.
I suspect the brain is then under busy and takes care of its conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often played her alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls Dad since she can think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish misleading images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "will take place in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain emerge, so they are so real."
Even nightly dream images value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally differ from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, mental health is able to recognize their deceptions as irreal.
Kasten therefore advises its patients to assess hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too conscious world, imaginary experience is most pathologic," says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Medical Officer of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightal Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also bears positive, creative - insanity is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of traumatically changed awakeness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced person considers to be real, and which he cannot distinguish from the post-warning state.
The oneiroide state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience full consciousness of motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of limit state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change is taking place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intense form of sense creation and sense in an unsustainable situation that enables us to create our own ability not to undergo in nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his uniroid experiences in his book "heart change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness goes on travel after a cardiac surgery with subsequent cardiac transplantation for days, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness at the intensive station.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: He experiences himself as a sleeping old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Is dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in his country of origin, surfing with his spiral bed in the Alps' fern snow and hitting a Korean mafioso.
It goes completely up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys differ fundamentally from any dream for clausesen.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
Contrary to that, the memories of mental travels are overwhelmingly clear to me after years and in secondary details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, Oneiroides, psychoses, hallucinations and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of external reality are in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow breaking can come
Burda
Children should take over the 27-year-old publisher
The new publisher Källen is an interim solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding is also expected to be part of 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit 27 years old and have the strong will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said to the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
You cannot introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he retired from the Board of Directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old call has been a member of Burda since 1999.
He was first responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector, the responsibility for corporate assets and after the withdrawal of Jürgen Todenhöfer also became the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the publisher.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies were not safe before the fall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital quest that completely speculated and thought they could get up to the big player.
My strategy never was that.
He had "no world power dreams", says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, located on the 8th floor, you can find renowned companies such as Hedonai, which ensure laser dismantling; Spaxión, with relaxing rooms and beauty treatments; the fresheners Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that highlights through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxing area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on the legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are only some of the many possibilities Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the customer's training units and thus offer them a perfectly personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos show you how to perform your training units properly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for recovering the hair span, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 22.00 a.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and that's why it's a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and get their strong clothes into our wardrobe.
The form of decollety, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
Endsa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and will make arrangements for mobility through management, coordination, subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is designed to focus on the promotion of electric cars and opinions and actions in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that endsa is involved in promoting electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero reiterated the steps taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would now have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," the President of the Government said.
"Thanks to this plan and to the willingness of the car manufacturers to produce in a very competitive industry in Spain, we can see a quiet horizon for this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall Automotive Industry Plan (PIA), provided €800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than €3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments were intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to boost demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the Autonomous Manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in the exhaust gases of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "sustainable increase" in the approvals which increased by 40% in November.
On 20,000 square meters classical vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classical Automobile Fair will be held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sports
Mazda wants to prove that sport is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic engine stop and drive system, baptized on the name i-stop, at the Mazda3 model, a device which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of the mazda 3 stands out by its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good stop.
In addition, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
When looking at the unit, consisting of the instrument panel and the luminaire board, you can find that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches, is in the uplifting colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partially reminds us of the style of Honda Civics.
It can therefore be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the nudity of German cars, especially from Volkswagen Golf, which all want to exceed.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive too comfortable by car.
All of this comes a large and clearly formed suitcase room.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-litre gasoline engine with 150 PS and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It stems through its thinness, its silent noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the switching and its low consumption , even if Mazda mainly the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test trip is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial equipment, especially the driver for driving track change (RVM), which thus removes the dead angle, but also also the operating elements for traction and stability, speed control, light sensitive interior mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the chromized 17-inch fields.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it were not equipped enough, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1.500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning Bixenon headlamps and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
Moreover, those who don't leave many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative to this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21.770 Euro for the Luxury model and 23.270 Euro for the sporty model.
In return to this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest passport.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars radiated, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a way to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose the magazine Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is nevertheless of particular interest to young people.
Contrary to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has placed two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all over Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to refrain from all the data to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience already requires a doctoral degree in physics and a good glass to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission of affordable roaming tariffs for all over Europe was almost always ignored.
Beyond your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that rightly.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (when it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariff means that telephone providers need to slowly, but safely rethink and start considering different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include downloading books and further enquiries on the Internet.
Without vetrag and hooks.
This is an internet-able device, and it is paid for only one time, at the time of purchase, and not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting of FonPeek one day too, an opportunity to buy with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails by phone, thank you.
In particular, I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama became President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models at both occasions: it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and so she wore something big-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the fabric from which they are made.
When she was introduced, she wore a dress from the top and in Oslo of a patterned rod.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and for the second time a loud model, but golden.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair crane at this time, the hair was open at the previous time.
75% of the working mothers have had problems at work due to their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This results in the study "Fruchtability and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years of age makes no doubt: 75% of women employed see their career opportunities on the labour market limited due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not and if so, what kind of occupation they practice.
Those of them who do not perform any other activity outside the house, work only half-days or have no fixed work contract become mothers and have more children.
On the other hand, women with a fixed employment, especially in the public sector, move the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore have less children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the retreat, a number rising to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have retreated their first child much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major influence on maternity, although less than the calendar in terms of fertility," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education is the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group aged 35 to 49, depending on whether they only have upper secondary or higher education, were on average mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 each for the first time.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with their primary degrees already marry before their first fixed employment and get their first child, the women with their middle or high school degrees make it exactly different, looking for a fixed job and marry them and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his enthusiastic list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say to the widely known advertising statement "Because it's worth it".
The main performer from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actors at international level, will become another famous sign like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
In front of her were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company has only exceptional messengers: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Schauspielkolleg von Evangeline in "Lost").
The awards of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (correct biography, life and work), but seeks a loyalty to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save any fears or illuminations.
As this book is a delicious reading enjoyment, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual temptation, just as I always felt without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhappy fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allgorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a marvelous poetic humor, without any sense, like the messengers who almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband, with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, was drawn into her banner, in whose flesh the emotions due to adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming into heaven on the way of corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in world literature, you have to climb on the north wall, on the wall, where the best mountain climbers are always trying to get new."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange cock.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a property owner of the county and another time he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy scream that was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would stay deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This was done on a journey where he fled before himself and with a speech of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses of Spencer are engraved: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a sad life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she always had her depressions.
The husband accepted it with absolute normality when she told him that Eduard VII spyed her between the Azaleans or sang the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neuroticist whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to fetch Joyce into baroja?
What was Benet going to do if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did this do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he may stand on this podest?"
Feigling aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixer we picked out of the animal house and weighed just six kilos, and then from a joyful sky they missed him two footsteps and hurt him severely.
Our disarmament cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, because the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the line.
In addition, the suffocation attack that a woman who went to walk comfortably when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she feared even for her own life, because if such a madman attackes a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a typically quiet district at 5 p.m. in the afternoon on a very normal Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have advertised in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our disarmament of the events has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what these young people have to do in their heads that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, on an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched, in cooperation with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), a campaign to promote helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of motorcycle accidents.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "is far more involved than only the design and manufacture of products that are becoming increasingly safe every day" and further reaffirmed that with other educational and informative actions they also contribute to a step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters in a first phase to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin emphasised that traffic safety is a "permanent concern" of the company, and precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, they are always committed to being one of their main objectives to the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks rises slightly again
After almost two years the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008, and, which is far more important, they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only being given with great caution, as the reference data used to compare are November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of depreciation, with a decrease of 60% in relation to the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles consisting of the small transporter market: passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small trucks and lighter small trucks/cars.
In addition, the same clouds are still in the sky, which are most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
In addition to these limitations, which are the result of credit institutions' reversal of money, other factors, such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation, need to be included.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the 2000E plan has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses, if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 output that may not exceed 160 grams per driven kilometer, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam reminded us that it is essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
For 2010 the car dealer association predicts a year similar to the previous one, for which it expects a 19% loss of sales (for passenger cars and land vehicles).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now required
As with the anti-blocking brake system ABS and the current ESP stability control, the emergency braking aid systems must become mandatory equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already required for all newly approved passenger cars and lightweight small transporters, for the remaining vehicles a karenz period has been fixed by the end of February 2011.
The aim of the European Union's action is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre which the system recognizes on the brake pedal using the brake strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident, before the collision, did not come to the brake pedal at all, and half of them had not been fully braked.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus the braking distance that a car places at the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrian damage could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even less accidents - it is expected that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver while already exercising light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant shall exercise maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the party concerned gives its consent to each individual point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy up Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back cover by the Russian Converg Group, is becoming more and more prosperous.
If none of these buyers were to reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it has not been sold until then will continue to be maintained.
On the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, bringing only 1,275 kilos to the scale.
In order to create this, they first abandoned the automatic foldable roof that was replaced by a cellular roof with manual drive, so that only one saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning, 13 times; and reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sports Bacquet seats, 12 times and with the light 19-inch panels, five more.
Then, by departing from the audio system CDR-30, one had reached another six kilograms less and by exchangeing the door handles with fabric handles the missing kilogram.
Although it is also available with the double coupling gear PDK, the test trip was carried out with a 6-way hand geared vehicle, mainly on the smaller country streets of California, on mountain routes which were really very curved.
In his driving behaviour, you can only give him the note without any fault.
However, the reduction in his weight did not in any way lead to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the street.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time, we haven't tried a model as small and light, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles at a low rate in the necessary time, until we give him the orders to shave, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything they tell him. The car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster S) has been very successful and it can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time in Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is inconceivably brutal, no matter whether it's out of standing or when accelerating again.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country streets we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do throughout the route; and that, although we found ice in some of these curves in the morning and roll split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra light car, a car with which you have an indescribable passport, as it is probably more rare and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 Euros.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neckline as her pockets of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many missing players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to Maccabi Electra's complicated football field and thus ranks first in his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was eight times the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 rated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue reds, who sat at the top of the tab from the beginning.
As the first four baskets of the Vitoria team came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team of Álava chose to play on the inside of Barac and the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with peppers and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of splitters had already been considered that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabeans wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that on their field not everyone wins, and thanks to the ever-invasive "hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellows" turning the rod (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, wounded, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few games with meeting safety to get back to air and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost consecutive trips and with the support of English and Ribas, made it possible to show a relaxing distance of (54-67) on the display board again, which the host could decelerate with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaveses were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they earned sincerely in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and even though splitter was put off for Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended itself well and while the Israelis were still picking up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv had lost for the first time in this season.
injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly against Olympiacos in Greece and had to take the lead in the group B of the Euroliga to him, and that in a game marked by the failures of Unicajas players (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the inner game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Malaga team was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blended the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Erein Unicaja, although the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22-20 to their advantage, the minute in which, due to an action, it almost came to the battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm and left its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez by himself left clear traces to Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleizas, with his three times, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pickup hunt was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to offset the difference between the game held in Malaga and 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the leadership within the group to vary.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the withdrawal of the Scott Robert Archibald injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis came back some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket, were not to be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to make the corb difference rise to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to leave the lead to Olympics.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of its profile?
The users of Facebook can now learn their salary thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users using more than 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain. A Facebook form is available to users to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average feels "badly paid", explains the product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through his search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives a gross annual salary of 45,226 euros and a French 31.059 euros, unlike the 24,000 euros that a Spanish earns.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 euros in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is the one server with 11.592 euros net annually, followed by the work of a seller with 14.725 euros and the work of a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most sought jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in her Embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President resigned from the Office must leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" had to leave the Embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21st.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, since his mandate expires that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the fixed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as a winner) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed to acknowledge Zelayas' refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician that the de facto government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you!
After the most enchanting days since the last spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is not surprising in any way, as this is their natural condition, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a naturally unsafe future.
The measure used to stabilise markets was to pay the debts with direct purchase of assets and indirectly to allow liquidity to be free at interest rates moving around zero, so that banks can buy assets to calculate.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost over and, without questioning their heterodoxic liquidity policy, start to spread some sand in the gear, as the ECB has already done with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodoxic measures, and we are just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatilities of the stock exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonuses are rising again, although they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalise private risks and government debts are rising again.
We are now relying on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area in relation to Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision down in relation to Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had once again tried to create awareness of what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects of the restriction of credits leading to job losses, when they had actually decided a new day to thank them.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has already been anticipated.
A government that blocks government debt, elections and a new government that draws the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a member country of the euro to no longer comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the need for ordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we are as expected before a period of normalization of the risk premiums, after some exaggerations to too high amounts, would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European company bonus.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish continued to grow, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
This from Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the previous indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 upward scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this, despite warnings, promises no long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "precautions while driving" is advisable.
Connected branches
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the Parliament's Subcommittee, where the energy strategy for Spain will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros and another 60 billion euros by 2020 from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion but 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more are needed, naturally provided by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft legislation for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, in no way wanted to say anything against this law about how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which is exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "in the long term, this direction is clearly addressed, despite some "individual" measures, as she referred to by the president of Iberdrola.
Be it as it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments should be made already now, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be established to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, has been set up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a building company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortiums competing with each other in the last phase, mainly from European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in deep construction.
Consortium Northern Direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group, is a member of the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (daughter company of the German construction company Hochtief, which belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialised in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisations, but it has an obstacle to overcome, as only the purchase of a local construction company will allow you to access.
A strategy followed by the above-mentioned companies High depth or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has obtained access on this market only through its 30 % participation in high depths, the owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
In this geographical area, Acciona is of the utmost importance for the sector in which it is already well known as an energy supplier and in the salting industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies mandated to build and manage the salting plant of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Nordzubringer), is intended to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest measure to drain the roads of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction in December of next year.
Even if this toll line is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, construction is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two driving tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is already a big business for high depth.
Australia, in high depth, awarded a contract with the government last night of 154 million, repeatedly awarded significant contracts.
The ACS sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre cables through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create quick Internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction works have not yet started and have received 129 million in depth.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools at 25 years.
The initial investments are EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has purchased its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received over 130 million for the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising by Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services to the agency Sra. Rushmore for the next two years over a sum of about three million euros per year, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of each 12 months. Sra. Rushmore has been selected among 16 agencies who presented the competition called for by Renfe, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, who has been responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and producing the campaigns.
A penalty of over 63 million for France Télécom for the outbreak of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of more than EUR 63 million for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed network and mobile phones through the signing of exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers at the edge of the regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned companies have collected more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 on grounds of obstacles to their competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority guarding competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore reversed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site in order to increase revenue from transactions that do not come from the telephone connection on the Internet.
In principle, this application site of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this colony is also available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Barça 476,4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has become a source of income for the football club since its birth in 1992.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the League.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the Champions League of the UEFA brings not only fame with itself. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have been participating in this event since their establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is third in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one next to AC Milan who has won the trophies three times.
The official Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 ranked fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that were able to take money through the Champions, although it has more title than any other (five, unlike four bee Italy, three of England and two of Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated financial allocation procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chairman Michel Platini is, expects revenue of 1.090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, the UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualification round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who struggled for participation received 3,8 million for their blush presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an indeterminate (400,000 dollars per team). The clubs that came to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that came to the quarter final, 3.3 million each.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed income.
Barça in turn earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European supercup in August.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is allocated proportionately to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
The champion of last year receives 40% of the assigned money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29,9 % participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday gave details about the supply of shares to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (Opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share paid to ten years and at a rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa evaluated the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had entered into contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would be 611,7 million, while the value of Sos is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In trying to remain at the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial querels of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created position which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free from polemics, because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will shift further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representants of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public invitation to tender Paternina for exclusion submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender for Federico Paternina submitted by Investment Company Mer on 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were met by the law and therefore the content of the declaring bulletin submitted, as amended by the last 2 December, could be regarded as "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares by Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which is 8.95 % of the company's capital, consisting of 6.142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it has been reported that 5 592.778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days, weather and accidents not only earn the garages
Every day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are transported to workshops where an expert has to assess the damage caused and the costs of repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of the costs of the parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the leader of the market; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing on the tool market for the evaluation and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is all other than simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming more and more, until more versions, variants and motorisations have come on the market over the past five years than over the entire fifteen years.
As soon as a new car gets on the market, the company starts working.
It is a difficult task, because each individual of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphical image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a highly sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure is progressing quickly.
If this is a less common car, it may take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-driven vehicle park, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight distributed centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialised in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually specialists in mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the base value or residual value of a car.
The only company that knows about a driver who knows about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain but in the United States.
When viewing the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose, i.e. for each assessment.
The most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, i.e. 5,75 euros a month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting tape, on the basis of the driver's seat number alone.
AudaGlass is dealing with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional market on the Internet, which can be used for vehicles declared to be a total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information about deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to enter the workshop due to pannes or how many of them had been involved in a serious accident during a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.

Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group purchased a record fom on the Internet for the sale of accidental vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.

According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose driving number has been decommissioned may no longer drive on the streets, but certain un damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
Cars of historical value may, on the other hand, be approved again, even if they have been decommissioned after difficult administrative procedures.
Estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching for the spare part, making and creating a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer technologies.
The database comprises 1.034 vehicles, of which 666 are passenger vehicles, 109 land vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the driving line number, a graphic of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user may include variables such as the price of working hours, surcharges or discounts, and then he can print the estimate and pass on to his customer.
AudaTaller, however, is not an evaluation tool such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, a amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
At present, Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanics have long been waiting for, for example, because you can choose a door with it and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
