No liberating novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted in a novel of the Penal Code.
The new regulation, which could have opened the way for the release of the former Prime Minister in detention, rejected the motion for a reduction in the penalties for economic delicts in second reading.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years of detention in October for a allegedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid; in December the appeal of the convicted is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime, and also in the West, the trial made the suspicion of the court's predominance arise.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, from the Penal Code was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is located in an unknown place buried in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, victory in the elections of Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council became aware of the law of the Scara, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft, you shortly hack your hand off.
Even women should quickly forget about emancipation, possibly disbelievers should be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Quran from its own mutually obedient tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would be hardly conceivable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle isn't the only and objectively the best and would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
In this sense, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the infidel dogs at all.
For their apology, it may be only the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose all power was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam and our politicians unleashed themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without having any advantage of this.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to see Libyan military occupation.
This is why the locals are unsettled - namely the expulsion of crusades.
But will the mineral oil companies also get black gold at the spot price without occupation?
Well, hardly and so the West can finally, with the right of its selflessness, praise itself in the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy them by the crowds of representatives.
Starting a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe are focusing on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm threw through Europe.
The Member States published their GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market breaks all records.
Investors keep an eye on not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, compared with 0.4% in France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected ( growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France allowed a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data were only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of the slowdown in economic performance was confirmed.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal estimates, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Over the euro area and the EU, between July and September, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The return from its 10-year state bonds climbed the value of 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The rate of return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The soccer selection has mastered the most difficult task throughout the season!
Thanks to a well-established Čech Torwart and a wonderful gate of Petr Jir.ek she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great portion of happiness, the Czech football could thus defend its luxurious advance from home play and will not miss again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise game in a detailed reportage.
Few excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second half.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1:0 thanks to the shortcomings of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jir.ek in Montenegro and thus ran their ticket for the football EM.
Even because of the precise defence game of the Czech team, they could put the Montenegrins under pressure only in the second half.
Damjanovic and Vucinic were the unfortunate birds of the party, who shot two huge opportunities.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will therefore be mixed with the European Championships next year, it is also pleased that the domestic football award is about 200 million.
From the first minutes, quite a fighter football was played.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half of the period, the pressure of the home crew remained, and the large drops in front of the penal area were successfully defended by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core programme of their country.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday noon before the object and then announced the death to the USA and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a lively shield around the nuclear technology centre in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make it known that they were willing to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary, with their own life.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has not for a long time apparently abandoned its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
Also in Israel, we are talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack in the intention to lay the Iranian nuclear programme as far as possible, according to the Israeli press, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan would also be the target of the attack from the centre in Isfahan.
The menu of a faty child: It doesn't eat breakfast and eats for evening bread sausage
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys have been shown - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Thus again, the importance of the environment in which a person grows up and the examples surrounding him is shown for the healthy development of a person.
On the tables of adipous children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families in which normal weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had the evening bread on the previous day of the education action under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence".
In families with thickeners, sport is not just one of the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence" supported by the General Health Bank and the Unilever Society.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children interviewed said, for example, to eat breakfast-second breakfast-Vesper evening bread in the mode five times a day - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for the evening bread
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families everyone eats breakfast alone.
The worst was the finding that every tenth family is not breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the foundation of healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in families with overweight children, a lot more unhealthy pommes are consumed.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks every day sweet limonades (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed do sports, fewer than half of their parents do - only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own meals from the available possibilities according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of diet is far from the ideal of healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many meals, meat dishes and of course sweet foods.
"Alarming is especially the popularity of sweet limonades," the final report stresses.
At lunch, i.e. the main dishes, they won pasta products just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like shell fruit and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are perfectly willing to change their eating habits when they receive correct information.
"The survey group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after completion of the informative lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence" has in many cases seen a significant shift in preference to healthy dietary principles," is mentioned in the results of the project.
For example, with the sweet limos, many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed a lot of poultry or fish as the main food of the day in the questionnaire and were prepared to eat less nuts or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had tasted a little bit that this was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "in the square" runs.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination takes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully completed.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (no single man takes part in the course) how to wear a woman who does not have an ideally proportionate figure.
And these are most of us.
The ones have a short neck, the other one too young without regular curves and the other again are molly.
It is the stylist's task to cash wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to sweep out the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to wear a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - with large bushing, broad hip and narrow waist - pretty and figurbeton without having to act too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really do not fit, at least one piece should be cut by measure.
You will certainly not regret this, because well sitting clothing is simply inexpensive.
In such a tailored rock you feel much better than in one of the staves, which is always too high and rotten, in the waist, etc.
In turn, young characters can be able to wear clothing with folding, buoys, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do in the light of the commissioned homework.
Each of the participants was awarded a celebrity for which she should develop suitable outfits - daywear and eveningrobe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the mode of the corresponding star and its character type.
I'm supposed to wear Miranda Kerr, which you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I jubel, because that's much better for me personally than dressing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (now, that's a little overdriven), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search on the Internet, print it, and then edit it graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and relationship to graphic design will then be expressed.
It is very important to think also about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also puts the so-called product page into the journals (as specified in concrete terms, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information on character types was just spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by Stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to use this.
And a skilled stylist can work in a very different way with one piece of clothing.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, that is, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear sleeves and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to clamp up the sleeve or collar and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice came to me: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you may hurt her first," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we have to break all these teachings, what can be combined with something, and why, even if you often see something different in fashion journals.
Don't worry about fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know now that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speaking ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
All of this must be counted on when designing the outfit.
That image and style are sometimes half of the success, which also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities often think this is thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something I look like is second-class).
And if someone of us can be styled, we should expect that he or she will probably force us on a completely different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to go google to find out with certainty that the boulevard press writes that the corresponding celebrity has again increased or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put our hearts on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit "to build together".
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a lied psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and stand to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and to supplement nice pieces, then we can't clear the whole wardrobe and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things you recommend what you can wear for it," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "plate bag" must contain.
So that kind of bag you knob at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, scooters for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist photograph products, such as handbags or hats out), special clips with which the clothes are roasted back if they are too large (signatures or other glues are prohibited so that the fabric does not be broken) and, of course, sewing equipment.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly cut down shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe sole, quietly the outside.
We tied up and we sticked...
With the scissors, you can't even touch the shoes so you don't damage them.
So you really have to do it.
Mario enjoyed me by praiseing my "creation" without limitations.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has now become clear - dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a child play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race cross through America
Review
The original careless journey is caused by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors in the routine journey to the early shift.
Although much of the ambitions succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions, what is the benefit of this, if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action races.
We were also curious about how the matched passages, in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and walks on foot.
But as you are used to NFS, in the end effect is much different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's not really any more errors, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible foolishness of game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main figure Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, one sits on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is carried out on another route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same.
Some environments still have to be viewed very nicely, although the technical level of graphics does not go beyond that of previous parts of the series.
So nothing moving in the world.
But the journey through the desert, through the autumn landscape or up by deep snowed landscape works visually very pleasant.
From time to time bring untypical elements a little change to the individual races.
For example, in the desert one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to watch out hellfully that you are not thrown off by a lawn.
In addition, the individual races are very well built up.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overcome the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stoppower), then you expect another personal duel with a single contrast.
And there's also a policeman who wants to screw up the whole thing.
A new one is passages where Jack leaves the car.
It's more about some interactive animations where Jack flees from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that in the game there are much less such passages than you would expect (concretely only three).
Finally, this is more of the advantage of the matter, because this element at least has no chance of getting boring - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model stretches into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means, from today's point of view, it does not rip out trees, on the other hand, it could not be said to be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around somewhere else.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be well suited to the local driving model, even though you could find better in competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only arise after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
Of a game of this kind, it is hard to expect it to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea of what the car is going on before a collision on any object, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: In close overhauling or driving on coming cars, in some places the other cars are "streeted" easily, but in other, almost identical situations, you come into sewage and turn wild pirouets.
Or the car's going to dirt.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter, it's annoying.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
When they've been exhausted, everything starts from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restart does not help, there is nothing else that helps to learn the critical section out of the head.
Very uncomfortable is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be passed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't pass.
Wherever you meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, no matter whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when one sees that the counter comes past two matching cars before playing, but until one gets there, the cars are already in such a position that one has to drive or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that this situation always gets close to your nose.
The counterparts have further advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always outdated by the same opponent at the same place and again here without regard to the time.
On the mad test, this is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which happens in the opposite direction.
The counter has to get one out of here, apparently, to the devil.
And when he's in front of one, he's naturally taking the view of one, so you start driving your own car in Klump a few times.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly wastes the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and also so action-loaded that you don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what's "debted" to it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boring can arise, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the race.
You must not miss the tank stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountain.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (demands) - that is, the races in the individual localities that you know from the history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (demands) and history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, different objects must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also associated with the online function Autolog, which compares among other things its own results with those of other players and also provides additional collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible cuttings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car to a subway tunnel (meaning), where you are resting on the rails in the darkness (meaning).
On the tacho figures look between 150 a 200 km/h (meaning), but there comes at once a subway from the back and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial office, we're probably going to argue long about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying is that at some exciting moments the image repeat frequency is slower and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit you anyway.
The sound replay is OK and the soundtrack is a taste matter.
In an effort to address a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "from everyone" emerged - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be reduced by the total unnecessary errors mentioned above, we could have believed with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems unfinished.
A great pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to put these errors in your eyes with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and euroscepticists
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the individual institutions out of the lot."
I didn't expect such a tough war to come."
"It will take five, six years until the weighs are smoothed and all become accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador of the European Union, started quite sharply her lecture at the Legal Faculty.
How seriously she takes the motto "Comprehensible and open to Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture that she was able to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could have discouraged such a number of lecturers of the Legal Faculty of the University of Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also commended the new President-in-Office of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was said to be too undoubted - a grey official who did not have such a role, but I have to say, it has squeezed all the breath, how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a person who makes it possible to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained her answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? Which number should I call on?", which is an important step towards agreement and a better readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil bucket quarrel from us
Ms Vicenová also devoted itself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago, she described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently in full hands.
As the ambassador said, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, has been quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the situation much more complicated, especially because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and efficient budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and less - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Comprehension of Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's horrific shorts, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I know, as a citizen, whether one really thinks of cucumbers or round cucumbers and various large bananas in Brussels, or whether someone really wants to ban us from the quarrels?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in perspective
The EU ambassador believes that the Czechs are called Euroscepticists who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in the European institutions is even more annoying.
Many factors are due to this, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Do you believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you guys doing together with your heads - is that your V4 again?"
Mrs Vicenové said that in the future the EU would expect tough rules on the budgetary policy of the Member States.
As a much realer, as a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries that want it should cooperate and those who do not want it should be quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately go beyond a strong "Europe of different speeds", Ms Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, which, according to which all issues affecting the EU as a whole, must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM was most accurately characterised, that would probably be the word "length".
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has passed a century since its establishment.
The basis for this longevity already laid her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already represented the slogan that countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became a brand to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's own magazine, which was already published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis for the company culture carefully prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century, because it remained faithful to its principles and did not fear backwardly changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during the first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Invented system
Watson has already worked social care for his employees in the thirty years - in the same way as the entrepreneur Ba.a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as working clothing and a thoughtful reward system for the best newer and dealers.
The long-term relationships of IBM with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was from the beginning brilliant in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced by a woman next year at the top of IBM - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she took the position of Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
In recent years IBM has made so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations are emerging.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Your incredibly position in business guarantees a strong image to the company and this to both the interior and the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony by Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasises, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo called because of family "Big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its most famous inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, string code or the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars of stock exchange value (market capitalisation), IBM was the second largest technology company (like Apple) this year, with Microsoft overrun for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of today's customers - unhappy, for example, were the attempt with the own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, leave it again.
Contrary to the counterplayer Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
In the profits of IBM, services, software and hardware participate to a fifth each.
In 1990, hardware was the most represented, with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low profits, worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time blew like a storm over the world.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the inheritance of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the middle of the major world economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to survive today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent in rocket-like terms since 2008 and the company's net profit is constantly growing.
IBM's corporate logan is: everything can be changed - only the values can not be changed.
That is why this flexible giant can be expected to be able to cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutting to world-all flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded a hundred years ago in New York had initially a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history reaches back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous technology cards to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who was also chaired by the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the director of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shade - based on Watson's ideas to date on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already tells, started with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cuttings to cash.
In the first four decades of Watson's leadership, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was in the chief chair for forty years, only then was he dismantled by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped to lead NASA flights to the All - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but, on the other hand, it purchased the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCooper and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy IBM has paid for over the past three years is the concept of "Smart Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform to help dealers start the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong story in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM established a branch in the Czechoslovakia of the time - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe settles in Prague and here is also a world-level top team of researchers dealing with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rycht’ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht.ová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband, Josef Rycht. (53) of the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), became their lover, Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life she has set out clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rycht’ová.
When Darina Rychtʹová had given refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she would probably not even have come into her dreams, as it is with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and out after 30 days on her drill, Josef went with her.
Yes, he even publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
With the time Darina resigned, it even seemed like she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the passport.
It doesn't matter who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtʹ Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs Rycht’ová, but she also said that she had already been emotionally separated from him and insisted solely on mutual decentness.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him has so far been with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, it doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company keeps running, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'll do the purchases."
"I am talking with Darina quite normal, but we don't share the bed right now," said J. Rycht.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who she is.
I understand that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take any responsibility.
The worst female impunities: How's it going with you?
If you ask men to call some typical female impunities, they shake some quickly out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you remember in the following rows, in which we let a few unseated revivals pass again that let men blow the blood into the veins?
Purchasing
Do you think your mate is shopping addict to them?
Do you have to buy at least one hammer weekly?
Do you like shopping and can it be a little bit more in the event of actions?
Then in your case, I think it's really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire under control.
But hand in hand, which woman is already holding up looking for a well-seated upper garment just so bumping through a dress shop and not trying all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Why don't you think of how many times they've told your husband? You'd rather stay outside...
Permanent discontent
"Are I not too thick?"
"I'd have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Is that known to them?
Yeah?
Then you must also be one of the women who are quite obsessed with how they look.
That doesn't mean that you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly shameful about her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - women are increasingly intolerable with the increasing frequency of complaints.
Order and cleanliness first
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wash tiles and dust, shake the bathtub - and this is at least twice a week.
Smash with her partner, because he once again tripped with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, squeezed the children, because the just shaken washbasin is already dirty again, and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", you should know that you must not overdrive and that order and cleanliness in family life should not be the first priority.
In the end, this imperfection of purity can also harm mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Stitches
"Smutty skirts come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel is not just thrown on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, it's not bad, they just want that everything has its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have had so much to taste.
Clask and twist
Some women like to cuddle and stir, there is sneaked behind the back, even sneezed, or smearing alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to smile through such topics, such as - who, where, who, who, how and why.
Probably every woman of us has a little harmless crap and twist on stock.
Hand-to-heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with the largest calibers, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which pose a significant threat to women's collectives in particular.
Jágr and Vor★ek helped Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr played a great deal in the NHL Monday game with two assistants on the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the Ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux enjoyed the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the game.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakubvorek.
After the game Jágr claimed to journalists that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Before the game, I tell him that he can do a hat trick today."
I felt that kind of like that."
"There is a feeling like this again and again," Jágr said, "who action Giroux reached a gate when the flyers first shot.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
In front of the gate of the Hurricanes, Preek fought the Puck and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first trimester's finish, home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short hander, but the second trimester belonged again to the flyers.
Concretely Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he achieved his third hit and then led Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the League, but certainly he's one of the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"I wouldn't have noticed in life that to finish my career, I'd play with such a hockey player as with him."
"I'm delighted."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my co-players put their game on me and now the spit turns around," smunzeled Jágr.
Carolina made the game a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who passed out of a shot, it came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was successful in over number two against one.
"Excellently pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) pulled away pawn."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Preek described the last hit of the party from his point of view.
Through this victory Philadelphia sat at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček wounded himself in the game against Buffalo and divorced in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to her, the Candidates also lost their leadership in the Penalty Shooting 2:3.
One of the gunshots was unable to transform Tom★ Plekanec.
More than the lost points pained the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defense - the game they played with only five defense players to finish.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the meeting with one experienced player, the rest of them were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, so we have to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"When each change one wave of attack after the other and we had nothing to resist it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
In the gates of the Jets, which thus ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized travel agencies in the ČSSR at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at that time only sold travels to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, and in the West, only the chosen ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotchi on the Peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-west course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Czechoslovakias) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even this has not been the case for a long time.
The so-called currency commitment - the condition for a trip to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign currency commitment it would have been impossible to retrieve the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that lasts until today.
The whole revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which you are no longer aware of today, is the fact that you were unable to travel to the Czechs' most popular country of holiday until 1989, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
From the beginning of the nineties of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation to the neighbouring Western European countries has been lifted, giving rise to a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could simply not get enough from their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers slept in the park tent on travel to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation at the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of travel abroad by Czechs was a full-packed bag with preserves, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists could finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus the average wages increased, which in 1997 came into another important moment.
Thanks to increased demands for travel, the travel agencies started regularly to prepare travels by charter flights after 1997, making the flight trips, thanks to the possibility to negotiate quantity discounts, incredibly discounted compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had currencyless payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-central" travel was in 2000, when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight was completed to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying annually in far-reaching sunny countries; this year you are flying 12 exotic destinations directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Czechs travel annually in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely ranked among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 tsd. CZK per capita for a single holiday stay including the cost at the holiday resort.
The General Assembly is supposed to find a new president - again threatens a patt.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been chaired and threatens to be known to the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Indeed, until now there is no agreement on what electoral order is to be elected.
And without this, no vote is possible on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom★ Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, calling on his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old querels between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the people's house in the Prague district of Smíchov for free, because the negotiations did not result in any outcome and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutary representatives or also the officials equipped with a mandate.
On this only point, at least partial agreement was reached, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion is that a representation on the basis of full power is not valid.
However, disputes about the electoral order continue to persist.
Nor did the Executive Committee make the matter clearer, where meetings - whether regular or extraordinary - are, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, representing professional football in management.
According to a statutary model, in the third round of the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he candidate.
Mayors are supposed to be willing to address the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage of votes.
"Then the two foregoing rounds no longer have any sense, this mode would question the whole two-room concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would best feel that the electoral order would not be adhering to the electoral order but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Mr Paclík agrees with this, although it is clear that the statutary electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that, as far as possible, the Statute should be elected."
"This does not invent any insane replacement variants, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plze.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his view, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the soccer-EM today would certainly help calm the minds."
"When the football rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is also greater", says Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reluctant.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people from Bohemian and Moron, but there are some efforts to "built up" the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a further blocking at the General Assembly is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy mind will eventually win," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations should be held directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete up to the qualification game at all.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disruption, so it was feverly looking for a replacement variant to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the location of the barrage game.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is certainly crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have moved the split parties within the largest sports association of the country to reach agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthyness of Czech football and also the upcoming ČSTV general meeting, which is designed to guide Czech sports in a new direction following Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík goes to the fight for the position of the president because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Mr Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers, had been able to make a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not at all have joined the fight for this top position.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Mr Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory he intends to exercise the role of President only for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary General Assembly.
In the position of the president he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
"I have spoken to some people who are eligible for this."
"Not to believe that some of them told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík is supposed to interfere with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Mr Paclík that Pelta should have the position of the President.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go ahead at all."
"The support of Berbr, a smart businessman, was twice as bad as football," said Paclík.
He also argued that Pelta's name fell in connection with phone calls for investigation in a corruption case some time ago, but that Pelta was found free of punishment.
"I don't know which prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta becomes president," but he already sees something more left.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the general meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could well imagine him as head of the National Team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had made sure that he was at the top of the appointment of the Arbitration Board with Luc Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the chairman of the association.
And in doing so he appeals to his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the League.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which will result in distant situations," said Paclík, who makes no heal from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby with the political leaders for more money flowing from the lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the key things that the new president should devote himself to."
"If it comes to taxation of gambling, as the political parties explain, then I understand their argument, but they also have to stick and say clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to Pilsner Club also does not regard Paclík as a disability, although he himself emphasises that the chairman of the FAČR must be "obsolete".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This isn't exactly ideal."
"But it doesn't make much sense for me to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will block a patt position in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make a strong commitment to the FAČR being given new statutes that would exclude disputes about the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is confident before the Thursday bargaining in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will be decreased in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
He decided not until the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so he could help the two-month break to defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present in a wider context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone," says the man who is primarily connected to the Jablonecer Club, but who also acted for many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Sorry was approved at the General Assembly in June Statutes which were not as perfect as they were all adopted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
He used the revision of the most important document of the civic association as a locking agent for the delegates.
"If I should become president, then I personally accept it and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a fundamental thing that he cannot be without," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to demarcate against his counterparts.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his counterpart would be his first alternate.
He hasn't even attacked Pacík for a long time, who left no dry wire on Pelta.
In football he has been moving over a year and can already point to some successes."
"However, his attacks were decreasing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Such as that, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed to his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his declarations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all matters - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of the corruption scandal of last year."
"As then, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry to the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleansing.
"I would have to get familiar with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, understandably, there is nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the disastrous scenarios of the day, which accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only controversial point really should be how to choose in the third round, then we can get away with it."
"Soccer needs credibility and it only wins back by finally having a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possible crucial day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR begins to work hard among him
If the former vice-president Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected to be the new president of the Czech Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly be a disguise to many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice you will start working hard.
He intends to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and otherwise to continue the work that Ivan Hašek, the previous president, started.
"As president, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting with international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, national selection, professional football, and performance football for young people."
"I do not want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member devote himself to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that football can progress with milestones in every segment."
Many would not be really delighted about it, because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to apply at all.
"I know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people standing behind me, who do not necessarily throw me a buckle between the legs and question every step I'm doing," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people told me that I shouldn't give up because others would do so."
"This is confidence that you cannot play," he said.
He is also supposed to be motivated to continue his work under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a big piece of work and I don't want to just throw that away."
"Processes have been launched which will probably only come into force in a few years and I would only be unwilling to see someone stop," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him, above all, are people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
You can probably blame me for some things, but not that I would be partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czechs.
"Although some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for mothers."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part whose winners then climbed into the first league."
"Then it could not happen that only three Morary clubs play in the League today, which is a problem especially for young players in mothers," says Rajchl.
Since the leader of the Pilgrim Club Thomas Paclík has now joined the fight for the role of the chairman, Rajchl is not confident to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice-president and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of ten million crowns for inferior contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly blamed for the fact that the association does not draw a single line.
While he says of Pelta that "he was disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football build new confidence," he thinks the second rival - Paclík is a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he would be elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek started and also the personal occupation in the Commission he would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to turn things to his favour," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Sprunge into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after a city tour or hiking the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip over the past one and a half years, one was not allowed to miss in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Lagging back on the water, she looked high in artificially designed domes, she swims with marble pussies waiting on the edge of the basin, and amazed over acriously restored youth style swimming halls.
She liked a bath, took it in her notebook, as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored Architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her book "Bath joys": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete built" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her trip to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe: besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn't have much on the hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
It's just anxious that swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine smell while joggers can breathe in the disturbing fragrance of forests or listen to a happy bird whisper in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools have to be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
Plotters in the jump basin and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so large because all senses are used, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made a lot of effort, swimming halls can be a true eye taste: "One of the floors has a water surface in the bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other."
Everything doubles visually: high waves, colored tiles, jump boards.
The small-format image band "Bath joys" conveys on 190 pages knowledge of the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but makes it more important to jump into the blue.
Remarkable copies discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful sanctuary baths such as the 100-year old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an original carst cave (Cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in your eye from the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and there is a window in the steam bath from which you can watch driving on the ski slope.
The most extraordinary pool design awaits bathing guests in longenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upwards open shells it damps in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal shine into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell as sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Bekescsaba it smells so strong as heating oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and its lick sticks to the skin as soon as you can slide into the pool - a special kind of wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in looking for beautiful bathing places: when she wanted to visit the free and sunshine bath in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 has now been closed.
When Meder threw a look through the warned windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest, the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad has been counteracted.
Three construction phases already have this bathroom behind it; you can discover not only neoroman elements that come from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Mauric Hall in Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favourite swimming pool of Iris Meder, not just because it originates originally from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge so different styles to such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a side thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up their business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In that, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global raw materials exchanges raise the prices - and the banks therefore bear a co-debt in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectors is specifically directed against German bank manager Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials bets were designed to protect dealers against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the zockers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "value to put the German Bank's good reputation at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations from the Foodwatch Report.
By the end of the year the examination is scheduled to be completed, the results will then be presented to the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bank - as well as a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank's top will then tell us what consequences it will have.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete departure, could stand.
Ackermann bastels on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising food prices is particularly drastic to show how disastrous banks today harm the general interest."
As the top banking lobby, Ackermann is now in special duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for bets at food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or the German Bank's reputation."
Ackermann's insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves the office.
On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive will not change to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
With a reverse from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses he hardly needs to shave himself - that would finally have to do with his successor.
Each second would terminate raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
It is therefore just 11 percent who believes it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers facilities where food prices are betrayed.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such business: Each second would, according to the survey, terminate all the investments where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said to think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The converted pavilion
Von Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian world exhibition spavillon in Brussels won awards in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and appeared.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is swamped, clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new construction materials typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is an outstanding and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
At that time, Schwanzer's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects known so that he built the Austrian Pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a sparkling side construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, planned as temporary exhibition building, had been set up, rebuilt in the Swiss garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof and opened in 1962 a 20th-century museum - the "20th house" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable for space and technique as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called "21th House" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, among which the house is, opens the first exhibition - a chance in all respects.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, has been completed.
Husslein-Arco, a professor of art historian with a considerable career in young people, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made a vigorous renovation among politicians and monument protectors, won public funds and private sponsors and established the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same-name foundation, there should be a cafe and a book shop, and a office house had to be built for it.
Strength of supervision, small state
For the implementation then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had so sensitively reconstructed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "uncommonly important place" for him, where he had viewed the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building that already lost generosity and ease when he moved to Vienna and his use.
During the current conversion, there were far greater problems: the building was a "energy locker", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were changed, insulation glass reinforced and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two floors brought room for the new use, a reduced light grave between house and road ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the light cocky pavilion.
The original external doors have remained, the house has been removed in the old red-brown stainless protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was before.
And all of this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
"Sometimes a material has to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rude ground in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and renovations, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It would have been difficult for the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Thus an architecture stands "ever at the wrong place" and still wants to "create a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "main train station quarter" with office and residential houses is created.
And another luck may occur: the 21st house could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and, as you hear, she already negotiates with the city for a neighbourhood location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter-crisis package in millions of heights
The train has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn spends more than 70 million euros in addition this year.
The "image" paper reported in advance, calling for an intra-group crisis plan, that by 2015 investments totalling approximately EUR 300 million are planned.
This would improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow disposal on railway facilities and trains to 16,000 people.
The aim is to release train paths until the start of operation and 90% of the operating needed softness within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Bahn-Chef Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays even this winter.
Last winter, the train had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in the event of difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in delivering ICE trains.
The train has also made it possible for years to make axles of ICE trains test significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at Cologne's main train station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the United States
After the tumult around Chief Josef Ackermann comes new unrest from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank at home, the industry giants also recover their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to resolve disputes about the plot of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a number of large banks to have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost great value during the financial crisis and broke the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not accuse any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20,5 million.
The NCUA president, Debbie Matz, welcomed the meeting of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps on board to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billions of damages that have arisen.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
In the summer, the regulier had also tried other big banks and tried JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage papers in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on domestic credit.
When the US real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this became a victim of a variety of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, changed.
Even though the events have been a few years ago, banks are currently hitting a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have intended countless complaints to obtain compensation or to commit errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of appeals.
She proposes 18 international major banks to have over advantaged the two US state real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in a volume of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank must also lodge a complaint by the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority demands that the Frankfurter people should be "substantial losses" without mentioning a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as obsolete and declared it wishing to object.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always explained that he is not investing in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies is not predictable.
Now, however, he has read IBM's financial reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight hit in the financial world.
As a result, the IT urgestone IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed at the CNBC commercial broadcast that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5%.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had made good profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said on strategy.
For a long time IBM has been working on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until then.
He says he only invests in companies, whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett used for example a freight railroad, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 own subsidiaries and shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it with smart investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unbelievable sense of earning money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
After the Buffet investment was announced, the IBM share increased by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue", as IBM is called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, and is thus, together with Apple and Microsoft, one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to enter.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blooding ideology" that is now resurrected.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small business in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkish people, this has returned a long-standing ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was, however, never in question.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimensions are not yet predictable.
"Does the bloody ideology restart?" titled the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the offenders should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that also German authorities may be involved in the right-radical smurf.
Besonnen responded to the Turkish community in Germany: she reminded the victims of racist violence with a warning guard in front of the Brandenburg gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier had the Turkish community in Berlin thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish contract.
In cheerful colours, it had been staged with each other - as a story of success.
Like an ear-feige, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftyth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It begins to smell," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Very critically, German Turkish Internet forums discuss the police's approach and the success of their searches later.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not have much more to look for suspects in the right extremist circles.
Some at least rhetorically show themselves ready for drastic means: "If you continue to be fooled here, the migrants remain nothing but self-defense and arms".
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of the education and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Muln and Solingen in the 1990s revealed.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can become rightly violent.
However, the attacks intensified our feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly complained after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President of State, but he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Cologne Saddle Ceremony - Kinkel counted in his speech the number of taxes paid by the local Turks.
As if the value of a person was calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks has since been in the rule of law of the country.
In addition to the efforts to provide extensive information and reassessment of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The scandal bank of Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since shredded from one crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to judge a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, he had become known that in 2013 he would become almost as spectacular a new job: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grossbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and dropped friendly comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the turnaround."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had circumvented all the bank's security systems and had cut around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS is also considered to be attacked - and everyone has asked: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to consult the bank in February 2012.
And he already took over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it's going to be hard.
He is not a banker, but rather an economic professor and banker, and would certainly have needed a working time.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved that it deserves the title "Maximum Skandal Bank of Europe" for a long time.
Because UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been scratching for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is the once so proud Swiss bank spared.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the hidden and solid but also exploited Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
For example, UBS managed more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world with 1.6 billion dollars in 2007 on the one hand.
And, on the other hand, she was a bank of investment in the League of the world's largest banks.
That was an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "I always put the UBS on my students as a model of a good bank."
"Today you're wondering, how could I get so wrong?"
He was hugely wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was regarded as a high-intellectual banker and as a genius banker.
A few months later, they figured why he had gone.
The bank's investment share had been shocked with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To shake this, UBS announced a capital increase of $13 billion.
For this, she actually found investors, though, about which some would have hit the nose until recently: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so hidden that they didn't even know his name.
But that was only the first hit.
In April 2008, it became worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and President Marcel Ospel, the second best paid board of Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS had to be rescued by the state in view of its lack of investment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank purchased UBS for ten billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond, through which she could become co-owner of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts so big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet sum of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphics).
"We could not save the UBS again," says bank researchers Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and expressed its willingness to publish the data of wealthy customers, who might have collected taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions as well as a penalty surcharge.
The UBS thus known more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Executive Board and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to false speculation and in asset management due to assistance to tax evasion.
And just when it became a little more calm, just when you thought that the UBS would get it again, then this unselling dealer story follows: An individual dealer shocks 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is wrong.
And it is apparent that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Zurich University Bank Institute.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of UBS is that it does not manage risk control."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had taken long ago to become guardians of the world's great wealth: no too great risks, for this security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic could break the world.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of incredibly reliable like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still suitable for the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main train station directly to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are steep, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss tradition stores such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have been resident here: from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are marble dressed, there are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a big sign of the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually has been pushed - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, finally, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS had become far too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axles had also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the morals of the fishing axles."
In fact, it was the Angel Saxony Investment Banking that changed the UBS, first gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," says Lukas Holign in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, the politicians allowed to save the big bank in front of bankruptcy.
How could it come to that?
If you talk to Swiss banks, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large banks of Switzerland joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was too large for the small Switzerland - and grew ever further.
This helped to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge bike.
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank scientist Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal, who has worked up from the bank doctrine to the top."
But Ospel finally relyed on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
It's a tragedy, maybe.
Clearly, overdueness came before the case.
UBS staff clearly remember the leadership meetings, on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same word: Goldman Sachs hit the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, all up.
She had already been lucky to take some steps.
In foreign exchange and stock trade, she played upside down.
Business consultants who were commissioned, however, showed a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the bank language "Fixed Revenue", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a pre-established hedge fund invested in American subprime plants.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and passed on securities on American mortgage credits, but also retained risks.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at the UBS have become a locker seat and are wackle up to today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has failed all the nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go so far (now).
But investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Switzerland was actually only considered a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from the predecessors.
In the meantime, he has gone through: he is supposed to conduct the business of the UBS permanently, the Zuricher Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to go back to the stand in the mid-1990s.
3500 places he's pulling.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself now.
Publicly, he only says so far that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US Stock Exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors at the weekly start.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unattractive.
The harsh industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief through the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had still been half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were pushed back to the foreground," said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the default values recorded for the closing of trade with a decrease of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.

Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced production and is committed to the end of the recovery.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as the Statistical Office Eurostat reported.
That's what the US investors sceptically said: "We're not an island but dependent," Steve Goldman from Goldman Management said.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness among banks.
The investment legendary Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early in his view to invest in European state bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade old principle over the crowd and entered the US technology industry.
His investment in IBM over more than $10 billion supported the share price of the tradition group and first made it note almost one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed cows are considered to be "problem birds": But the high-intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts claim.
The ones like them, the other want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been a city picture for centuries, but in many municipalities there are many people who are complaining about the dirt and noise of animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows were no longer available from the cities, said experts at the first crow symposium in East Friese empty.
There specialists from all over the federal territory advised about possible exits.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature protectors also led the problems in cities to the land fugitive of the particularly protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing farming and the fall of typical bread trees made the birds difficult to live.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are available in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in empty.
In 2005, there was a controversial project for mass killing of crows in the county.
Criticists had said that catching the animals in bird traps and smuggling with knuckles were particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, burial, does not bring anything," said Werner Klöver.
Water spraying or falling trees, often having undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals depart, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Graining is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surroundings, the problem could not be solved in the cities, mayor Wolfgang Kellner from empty.
A combination of burials of animals from sensitive residential areas and lock offers is possible to relocate them in other places.
On the other hand, "Info tables instead of chain saws" warned the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "A pickle in the face is the best way to end up with ourselves."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Asheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, on which signs inform about the life of high-intelligent seeds.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of birds Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows use not only tools to get to a delicious bite, but also make their own tool as a tool.
Behaviour researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four seed crows, as far as the intelligence of the birds is sufficient.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a rock to crash in order to reach a mottlarve.
Without a lot of training, they determined the size and shape of a stone to have the platform collapsed.
In a second attempt, the steep crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small mucus with a mottlarve.
The birds were unable to reach their prey with the snake.
However, the researchers had left them wire pieces.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with which they then caught the buckle on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even made this progress.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks remained out of hand.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are included in the EM 2012.
In the play-offs, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Headed by the double successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal hit Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation perfect in a sequence after 0:0.
In the play-off back game at the outside side of Montenegro, the Czechs reached a 1:0 (0:0) after the playback (2:0) had been a clear thing.
Nothing left Croatia burning at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland picked up a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80).
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade fmeter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
In Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a step-by-step start.
Ronaldo chased a free shot from around 30 meters to the early leadership into the faces.
A good quarter hour later Nani showed its broad shot quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by gate hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the gateline (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
Afterwards, Schiedsrichter Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Penal Room, Stark decided on a swing and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade fmeter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic turned safely.
After the break, however, the 2004 vice European champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This means that the European champion of 1976 will be the fifth in a row to the EM.
However, the team of trainers Michal Bilek and the Federal League Legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to survive a second of terror in the early phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented with a reflex at the last moment a possible private gate by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penal area border just close to the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross lattice had to save the Czechs for the already beaten world class gateguard, again the storm of FC Seoul had dragged off (50).
The gate shortly before the end finally made it clear.
Turkey has missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While national trainer Guus Hiddink has to clear his seat at the 2002 World Cup Third Bank, Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM round.
Before 31,000 viewers in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the pawn in the seventh minute with a distance shot, the attacker Kazim Kazim could also not drop the attacker in the gate.
However, after the horror second Croatia was increasingly taking over control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic at 62 minutes, the Bundesliga Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of trainers Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 result in the play, in the 32rd minute.
Constantin Vassiljev (57.) was similar to the guests.
From the beginning Ireland pushed to speed, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible leadership strike.
But in the 32nd minute it was ready.
After an unfortunate defense by the finisher Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP will invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, the Dax Group announced that about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow, on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," co-chair Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase revenue to EUR 20 billion by 2015.

Currently, the business of the software provider, who employs 55,000 employees worldwide, runs as rarely as before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Sensitive and grandhearted starts Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of main people who go to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund's, are lost men and women in the fog of the war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he describes not inappropriately as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, sparkling reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unseen men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose members, get mad or die.
Each of these lives flakes up like the votive candles in a church, some add, while others disappear.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the West Front.
"Schönheit und Horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Among the soldiers in this book are bee corbs, a Christmas celebrated among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetseflie are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells like a cordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is home with her children, and canon fire hears in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what's going on or why this war is conducted at all.
"Failing facts," says Englund, "was muffled with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Schönheit und Schrecken" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmatrix.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories may be terrifying or touching, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the small moments that lose detail.
Many of them act of deficiency and help themselves.
In the history of a German schoolgirl he says: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false radius rubber, paper associations, wood buttons."
He tells more about supplementary food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in hammel fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes sealed with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are of honor and braveness.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "You feel that despite all that was meant for men rather than sitting in the leaf chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, and so to do as if such a façade was a civilization and as if there was no barbarism behind your own reinforced and seized shirt chest."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he probably dies and no one will take note or take care of it.
"If you take aside the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens before a public," he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations relate to the old Europe which falls apart, and to new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," says Englund, "a war between the factories."
He catches the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a measure suit that slaughters while he sits behind a desk."
People act in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund talks to the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexual illness to escape the front service.
"The vast expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcus oaks, because soldiers bought and smuggled themselves on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"These who were really desperate screamed him into the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes flattery and yet impressive and fits perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which the war "deployed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to the fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually rather distorted like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Notes "Not New In the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of glory.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read of in a book of facts.
I'm not giving it to you anymore.
But it's as if with his book he'd picked out this page with the main people in front of the nose and burned us with a stick.
After an early failure, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
One had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at that time there were hardly people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. All others initially believed to take part in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence emphasized the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the last few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the demert and caused the housekeepers a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
So the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing the handling of occupations in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move to the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the orders, what was a declaration as "exercising".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zucotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park, were the high-level officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clean the park, but then wiped back, when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials from different police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including mission commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are normally deployed in high-criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like commuters, so 1:00 a.m. is a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people are in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure on the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the news recorded in advance, which drowned from the speakers, seemed to be intimidated by many protesters.
When the public officials ended up in their bright blue wind jackets in the park, many protesters simply picked up their things and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be touched until 1:45 p.m. to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and good.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the surroundings to intervene, arrests in the park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the President of the Police, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were trying to stop them from watching the police operations in the park, and they said that the officials' dealings had been very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
When the police moved towards the west through the great confusion of the personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their staff members of the city cleansing who lifted up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared shortly later on on the Internet.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were connected to their arms.
And two people chained themselves on trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police statements.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, due to "unreasonable behaviour and resistance to arrest".
Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department, was the highest uniform official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of the Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "doesn't lead the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built in Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block south.
It was observed that from these locations from the police, the surroundings of the Zuccotti park were increasingly widened.
In one place was observed as several officials, many of them with signs, drove persons out.
Approximately 28 people were located in the northern circle.
Some of the most violent acts of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place the quantity threw a piece of block wood.
At the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of caregivers will lodge proceedings against the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school nurses who lost their job last month, intends to sue the city on Wednesday, because the redundancies due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to revoke the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the poorest paid employees in the city and had lost their work in chess on 7 October described the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups discussed last year to close the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specifics that staff would be dismissed from school aid.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the complaint will be formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will bring Mr. Walcott and the City Ministry of Education as accused and count eight redundant workers as claimants who are all colorful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the City’s Ministry of Justice, said that the city did not present the complaint and that their individual claims could not be commented.
According to a draft complaint before the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in the poor districts of the city in order to support a complaint for inequality. It claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It suggests that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and only a few dismissals in the Upper East Side or TriBeca schools, 17 school helpers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 helpers were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
By finding the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed at the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not the neighborhood of deceased parents who can organize donations to capture budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26% this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school registration.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even though "excess" in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of workers available, paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft complaint.
Mission completed, Congress ready, agreed on Libya
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the revolts in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee for International Relations decided a resolution under the responsibility of President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) and praised Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun the reconstruction of their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the vocabulary of a series of resolutions approving or refusing the role of the U.S. military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad marginal group of both parties and there was no vote.
The same day, however, this law passed in the Senate. In addition, the chamber agreed a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
This led the U.S. mission to a kind of legislative flaw - with a congress that was sufficiently excited to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was outdated by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratifies the people of Libya to their enormous courage and exceptional endurance in their self-liberation" and "loves the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners, who support military operations to protect people in Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislators as the June Act did?
The last version is based on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the Committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is at the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every period of Congress of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or another area currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to put their amendments to the vote, although they have tried enough.
Goodlatt's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to this Congress and which includes a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to the Congress and to the Senate - others differ only slightly from each other.
In the Senate alone there are at least 15 versions of the balance budget change and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors, in particular those who want to polish their CVs, the opportunity to "write" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act adopted in August requires both the Senate and the Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress may submit while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among equal sex is a recurring model, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As zealous as Members propose amendments, they move as fast as they have been in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments. at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is blatant compared to the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures made available by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Received but not defeated," said Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after a armed man shot her from the nearest distance during an election event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on Monday evening on national television. She alone sang to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to the Congress.
When she appeared in the ABC news "20/20" together with Diane Sawyer, she ranked according to words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that divided its skull through the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the Congress to give her voice to the debt brake triumphingly.
In her first television interview after the assassination in January, where six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their healing as "tricky".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The Special has been following Gifford's recovery since the 8th January assassination.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a chained head and a long shell above your forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sit in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nigga with the head.
A tick with your lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days Giffords whispered another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see how Congress Members sing together with the therapists of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is necessarily medically treated while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, heart, heart."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told me, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, Gabby, you weren't defeated?", said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you're going to get through this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever before.
Troops Fear More Condolence than Respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, Matros, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount of black smoking rose up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it was no respect, really not. It was compassion.
The broken contradictory impressions illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its prize, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting like you are doing people suffering in uniform.
"We were no victim," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support the one is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unreasonable or in a dispute with the public they serve.
They also realised that the wrath, which struck the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result, there are talks about sympathy in the breast-feeding and private life between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of respect, as they had defeated rebellions and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "raged, violent veteran is hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers subtlely asked if he was able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the battle.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little military experience and sees little benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or for the seriousness of their injuries.
Military faces the growing pressure for harsh intercourse in rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervention in rape before the military court.
If not, hundreds of applicants will be ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped at night by a soldier's colleague.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her bar in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he should take her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm clocks went on," Lyman said.
But the texan wiped her concerns off.
I thought, "Oh what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my stomach."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously waiting for a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a complaint brought against the former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not proceed against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 claimants, but in the following months increased to 28: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to identify, condemn or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the highest military leadership since the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the cultural retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of all applicants put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject the complaint.
The files of the court, which are present in Newsweek, detailed the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused of any injury that has occurred in the armed forces by current or former soldiers.
On the basis of the 1950 Supreme Court Act, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for any injury to the active soldiers.
"The alleged damages occurred during the military service of the applicants," the document states.
The Department of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result is that between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in battle.
It is time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more grievances, except them, are pending.
At the Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a women's-feminous atmosphere.
Independently of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America accuses a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", received the rape victims to release them from the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of war veterans) in December, in which she claimed that her discriminatory practices in dealing with entitlements for persons who indicated having been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of points of reference.
In 2010, the Ministry of Defence reported 3.158 sexual abuses, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. the Office for the Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse).
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded came to court in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell her the details of her rape to a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked about the sex she had before attacking her friend.
Six persons declared themselves as character witnesses on behalf of the suspected perpetrator, who was finally released.
"I remember the day the judgment was read," Lyman says.
"I thought the wrath would be used. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department, and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "it wasn't his procedure. It was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonestly fired, so that she was not supported.
Whether the complaint submitted by Lyman and the other claimants is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "I think they should make progress."
What stands between them and a sentence is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres Doctrine in time life.
The military has a decade after, because they do not have the same incentive and discouragement that brings liability.
He adds: "The chances stand against her... but it's important for them that they try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will start with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until there are reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How to observe researchers on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to have committed an amok race in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in Cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his attack on his computer and has appreciated some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the UK idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as has been done by marketers for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extremist groups across Europe and then addressed them with Adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey in which they asked for their educational status, attitude towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a quite new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of extreme right groups are mostly young, male and annoying about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "thes who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideology factories, medical researchers and policy scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on average three contents per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that allowed the number of scientific work with the name of this page to increase by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you don't usually reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to interview people from the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook it all goes away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-body on Facebook are significantly more likely to be drunk than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as housing consultants, monitor the site and help a student when posting too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify vulnerable children that would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly absorbing the data of its own population.
The data team on the page has produced statistics on the status of relationship and Valentine's Day, participation in the mid-election 2010 and a national lucky index (mainly using information that only Facebook has access to - Masters of Digital Liberty know for a long time that the site should make its large data find grub available to others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the page watches them whether they want to or not. To play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, the page allows you to deliver your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines how to collect their data offline, everything online is allowed.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"When it comes to her, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years of technology research, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of social life - and a lot of social life is still offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two amok races where 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, himself described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he said in front of a court room with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations supporting hate-sideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologist, as he "did not give Braivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to address the members of his victims at the end of the hearing, Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely check all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and members of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind castle and riegel.
Everyone took part in the goal that everything would go beyond a road.
"I thought it was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue cravate and worked quietly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left it again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not the work of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the tragedy and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs shown this week in a theatre
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5th, some compared him with Henry Ford, highlighting the technique genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find the most informative in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusty this week before special film performances in the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself appointed hippie, but he was also an acribic organizer who was eager to draw charts - a man who believed that many managers were suffering from "a disease of thinking", "that a really great idea represents 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Tromboph of the specialist idiots" about the emergence of the personal computer. And he was sitting with jobs for more than an hour, in which they held one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At that time, as ten years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Jobs died was a complete VHS copy discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for disgusting detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thought, where jobs clearly balance their thoughts and seek accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism is manifested when it seems to be impatient to respond to Cringely's questions and encourages him to respond more quickly to the issues or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow terribly far-reaching when jobs are assessed, which other companies are making their opinion right or wrong and represents their own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous valuations of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the desireful dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to lead a company:
"Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made easy."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I noticed.
Jobs continues to pursue its efforts to streamline the accounting system with Apple.
Wondered how costs were recorded - mostly they started with "standard costs", which were quoted only on assumptions and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the minimum.
How the Pope was cursed:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could enter the telephone company and lead telephony for free.
A lot has been written about the device, but job enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a feeable phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you grabbed into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Job kicking.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure all over the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continue to tell about a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they could as well as follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were invited to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, they had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Many times in the interview Jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some plates, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember persuasive arguments... she shouted to me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse we could build for $15. That was unbelievably credible.
About large companies that fail to:
Long before he allowed Apple to revive, Jobs foresaw the paths on which so many industrial giants went through with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do a better copyer or printer, well and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is needed by people who do not have a concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, that Microsoft could have been the 1990s...
You caught the defeat from the victory.
About Innovation as Art Form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You need to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes beyond taste, it goes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created and then trying to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists are copying, stealing great artists.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
A part of what Macintosh made great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who randomly were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, it would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas eat with opponents of health laws, as court adopts case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically-sharing question of whether to hear a challenge to the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint that 26 states brought against the extensive reform of health, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law which became a keyword for conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a five-half-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to trigger the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full progress at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will be in court and claim that the law is to be stabbed will probably be Paul Clement, once General Attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federal society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenge the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had advised the case in a Washington hotel.
Mr McConnell, Head of the Republican Group in the Senate, and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the federalist society for years.
And this does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the Low Federal Judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in beneficial events of close and other organizations of law, where the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to programme, not a guest of such events."
Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was sufficient for two of the firms involved in the case, as well as for a company with a massive financial interest in this in order to alarm moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinned during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings in the court."
Their appearance and support for a donation for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix justice matters too easily with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama government when the first lawsuits came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because she was too committed to defending the law in order to be unprecedented.
Kagan does not do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 billion dollars on land
Airlines Emirate orders 50 two-way aircraft of the type Boeing 777 with one option on 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It is really a rare news that a company receives an order of more than 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals is at a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
The buyer of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders, is also unusual.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest order of all times for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 twin Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammer order came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline has also, so Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai aviation show, an option to buy 20 other aircraft, which makes the total list price rise to 26 billion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, the so-called Dreamliner ordered six Boeing 787-8, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Stock Exchange Professional of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural guarantee," he said.
The ordering of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in chess, who attackes the predominant position with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that the introduction of the largest A350 would be postponed, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher burden and scope.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported the opponent Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's position.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. On Monday she claimed that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the governor's position in the Western state by the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral process and especially last day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... They have occupied election cabins, built road blockades ... and mandated people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Claderon hardly, which had been conducted in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, took place three, a serious defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home country and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence still lasts.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to be represented in the PRI race around the Presidential Office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a courageous look next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asia Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Administrative Director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world must "all in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support to European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
The European Monetary Union has had a serious debt crisis over the past few months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rate costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers have resigned from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe fears that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries would have to join together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - gave greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in his power" to help the euro area, since its own economy now suffers from declining exports and drying out foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro zone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we'll find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have an incentive to help rich Europeans when they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the US Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 billion people in India, of which more than 800 million were living on a daily basis.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks retire with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well paid employees in public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-producing facilities such as rail.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" throughout Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/ now threatens "the risk of classification" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" in order to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital change in their vocabulary.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon from possible cuts in defence
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta warmed up to the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticedly, thereby triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war spots in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of 450 billion dollars over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of 600 billion dollars or more will be necessary if the Congress is unable to conclude expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to achieve a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop for many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unprecedented way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building - and other modernisation efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians safely to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alarm."
The cuts were finally hit by the fighting forces," Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas are not directly affected by seizure, serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in attitudes and recruitment supervision that support war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to wartime dealers and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of automatic reductions on the Department of Defence.
"The consequences of the seizure of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vigorously opposed to this draconical act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not anything that we should be pushed on."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to exclude the pentagon from cuts will remain awaiting.
Panetta has increasingly blurred out the possible cuts, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture of what could be ahead - a military with shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without worms."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air-weapon swagger without adequately trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of caesars, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech in the Pentagon.
"It is a military force that lacks morality and alarm and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She's actually making you angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta mentioned new details about how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capacity to operate and intervene, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defensive projects of the removal could be victims, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter vehicle, the Army and the Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that possible dangers by China and other opponents can be eliminated.
How to Describe a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is committed to the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides are reluctant to lie.
Penn State's leadership is accused of mineids, because they allegedly kept reports that a retired football coach abused boys sexually.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when the French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to American President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself fooled when he brought down denials that were very quickly rejected by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate, John Edwards, is accused of the violations of campaign financing related to the destruction of a non-marriage relationship.
And then, of course, no one who experienced it forgets the media circle that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about slums at school and at college tests are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers provided their students with the answers to the examinations so that they could be good at their performance reviews themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and scourges are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lied to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Identifying or "discovering lies" is a , which is important to learn for every person, both for personal and for professional reasons.
Far from a societal game, such as sharads, where the goal is to call "Have you!", the dismantling of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at renowned universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of research is that most of the old myths about the lie were dismayed.
Lies look into your eyes.
They stumble, stump, red and don't always cuddle.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to discover and dismay.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine expressions of the face, the question and timing.
I spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of deterrence. And it is clear that deterrence is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find ourselves right in our complex world, especially when the appointment or interview of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in appreciating other people, awakening their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitively as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was disguised as a offender, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laugh, the voice quality of her experimental person.
You should better know when someone usually triples with the foot, so they do not accuse him wrongly when he triples with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of accumulations of noticeable verbal and non-verbal behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as proof of deterrence.
People who deceive, may stubborn when they try to remember their history. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they turn towards the exit, change their position significantly or show a "slapping after the appointment conversation", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questions often falsely signal that an appointment interview is over, only to keep an eye on this relaxation after the configuration conversation.
Also, take care of the language of your experimental person.
Scott Peterson's exiler is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a remote language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a difficult question in general.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualified language" when they answer a difficult question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... to the extent I know ... according to the best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells shine.
There is no magical means for dismantling lies, but you can learn skills that allow dismantling.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can rarely become a victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil peline is revised after risk due to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, making the trade unions annoyed and at the same time calming environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to redesign the project so that you can return to normality.
On Monday evening, TransCanada said that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline was finally approved, although with a different course.
This was done after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal authorisation for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and gave its support.
The 1700 Mile Pipeline was used to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, consider the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the chief auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate survey of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused because she allegedly forced a little child from fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle, in the lobby of her Manhattan building, would have had a tobacco attack that would have made her little daughter so scared that she gave up for fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so scared that she was suffering from "personal change, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a nurse, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter off for a moment.
"Somebody appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman angryly.
"She said in an aggressive sound: "You should not put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to spark - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to pierce water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle crashed on the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on the arm, and had to be kept away from her accompanying and drawn to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is a non-specific compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not pay a fee and plan the family, the money she gets, the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to assume responsibility for her behaviour," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a nurse who wears a 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate intrusions inhibited the economy
In the first year when Mario López Valdez was in the government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
In 2011 Sinaloa's economic history will be remembered. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who called himself the initiator of change and gave great hopes about economic growth, is the government. However, as a result of climate disruptions, growth cannot be mentioned, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators have worsened.
The low temperatures in February caused not only millions of losses in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and resulted in a general decline of 3.6% in economic activity in the first quarter.This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16%, which has slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicoo para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural lands were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent were completely and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Institute Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since from January to March 55,053 people in Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 per cent of the working population. In the second quarter the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa, which is 18,969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is based on several factors. Economics scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses on the market due to the reductions in the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are illegally accumulating dollars it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Stop migration
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, on the one hand because of the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people are staying here and looking for work, which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of black labour, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 per cent of the employees working in the country without paying into the social security cash.
Unemployment and black labour are the lowest wages throughout Mexico, according to the statistics of the Institute of Mexican Social Security (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Regal Employment and Social Welfare Authority in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, which is much lower than the government average of 7375 pesos.
Reduction of ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, in 2011, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) has been recorded over the past decade. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to US$ 630 597 from January to June, corresponding to 87.74 per cent of the deficit compared to US$ 5 143 312 in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Regal Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies from the tertiary sector.
The debts
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in July at the National Congress. The National Congress approved a loan of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be found by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdé's first year of government revealed his inability.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico) said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very difficult this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the well-united government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the Frost at the beginning of the year complicated and slowed the economic development of the country.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the freezing. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not in motion enough to create an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will finish the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefined appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Business Association) in Sinaloa said that the state must be driven to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for re-determining the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that guides the government's efforts on better tracks.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offence - here the possession of marijuana for trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military in monitoring Cipriano Valdez Street in front of security post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white truck where he found a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack where the soldiers were eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the court.
Debt for construction
The social structures for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are at risk of not being completed because of lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Head of the Urban Authority for Social Development stated that, although the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now at risk, since the government has not paid its resources for the three programmes over 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far only Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, so it was expected that the construction would be delayed.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had to pay us a part in July already," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, so the municipality had to receive a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its government period, which corresponded to the amount that the central government had to pay.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the State authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was asked to accelerate administrative work and pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"At least 12 million they have to contribute, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The transition of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Bureau's office and, in the light of the lack of eight votes necessary to challenge the law, which must be forwarded from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the decree of law with details on switching to digital terrestrial television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to allow the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree of law unconstitutional, since the regulation of radio and television is the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) and therefore the decree of law would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and reservations of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree. After the adoption of the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree and discontinued all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he was not in agreement with the project's arguments, in the sense that the state government should not regulate the measures to be taken by public administration with general rules.
"I don't think that if this were to be done, the independence of the regulatory body would be impaired." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is responsible for state affairs.
Replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place throughout the world in recent years and results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The delaying of the transition, she said, is a delay in the enjoyment of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "required the action of the whole system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries had already implemented the digital changeover worldwide, via the government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of the Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the number of votes in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
This year, the possibility of the single counting of the voting table is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Elections Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's elections is close to 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that, just on 9 November last, the electoral body had adopted a number of rules to harmonise local rules with the federal reforms in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the State indicator within the time limits set for it, with the argument to have no objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the Constitutional Complaint filed by the local legislative authorities and judged the voice of the State Commissioner on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful", as he did not have the right to "decide or to apply a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of the individual counting of votes that the Consejo General del IEM now had the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the voting list partially or completely.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are in fact not available, it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the full-filled ballots can be done if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the second-place winner, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party-or coalition president, who is the second of those candidates.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after the completion of the regular calculation, it is found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages which have been suspended from a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés took place at Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday the death show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the colonel's last will was that his ashes would be scattered over the mountains of Zapalinamé.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, together with the others who came to life in the accident in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force. The most nearest persons participated in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 noon, the ashes of the colonel landed at the mourning hall located on the Nazario boulevard Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Technological Institute of Saltillo. During his preparation for the academy, his former fellow students attended the technical academy and his American football team, Felipe Bacio.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the mountains of Zapalinamé. He had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he was in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always tried to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as he took Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had driven to Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One last farewell
The colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honour under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. His honour was given to him the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the heads of school and students of the Saltillo Technology Education Centre, where he studied in 1985 and appeared as excellent in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter flew by him, in which also the State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the remnants of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over on the front of the Kaserne from the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez. He was already expected by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned body was found on a property on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military members presented the media with eleven persons who had been arrested in the same place in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in a abandoned Finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the 1.5 km of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passagers saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall was lifted up in a scattered way.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another one, dressed with a white top.
Nearly one meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place because no cartridge shells have been found.
At the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that one organized criminal band writes to another, and several shots in the wall and door were found.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a crime committed mainly in the town of Cadereyta and associated with abductions, murders, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight persons were first arrested on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and one cell phone were secured. The arrested confirmed being members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th at 6:00 a.m., on their watch round in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, soldiers found a car without two inmates.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military looked at.
You will be seized with secret records in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government, which is to offer the head of the crisis that Italy has led to the outbreak of economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government, which is to offer the head of the crisis that Italy has led to the outbreak of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet on Wednesday with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President of the State the results of the discussions with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. At the same time, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an intolerant level.
The new government led by the former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough savings package that was called for by the euro politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti's hurry was still intensified by the volatile market situation, resulting in a 7% interest burden on Italian government bonds for 10 years, which corresponds to the level in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue umbrella.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confindustria Industry Association, told the press after a meeting with Monti, "We said we would support this government in every way."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
The success prospects of Montis were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the middle law party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have voted against a majority of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the delay in the reform could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks also exercises pressure with its indication that Montis' failure is a disaster.
Monti began on Monday with his discussions with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial associations as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The round of meetings is scheduled to be concluded on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
Recent breathing up at the end of last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs of Italian bonds have again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a government debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections that are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will give him only time to implement the reforms, instead of prefering the elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should be made up of only technicians, an indication of their concerns regarding the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spanish have more play opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten over 50 international games have on the buckel.
From Costa Rica's pages, only one of the 22 called 50 games is behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 played for the friendship game, which takes place today at 15.05 in the San José National Stadium, are compared with players from both countries.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one on the FIFA Monthly Rank, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-colored team only has the defence player Michael Umana as the only one with more than 50 international games.
This number he reached on last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and Cup championships) as well as high-level European Cups such as the Champions League.
Additionally, the experience with the Spanish Furie in complex excretion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have few international encounters within the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list.
We'll see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who on last Saturday against England (loss 0-1 in London) met 126 games abroad with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA last week, together with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approached Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and near Michael Umana, the left sidestorm Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five of over 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
There are less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team, there are fewer than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even approach the 20s border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot most of the gates with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet took Costa Rica into its tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that realizes itself"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of the best concerts in the National Stadium next Sunday.
For more than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream will be realized for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week from Brazil an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they appear in the National Stadium from 19.30 a.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an extract from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to a vacation in Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoteed. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we've been doing in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few gigs in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always traveled to surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view to the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't have any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly the case because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song so that the decision that we will play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we can better keep our concentration up and surprise us because they remind us of why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that is why it is also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your 20-year-old story.
If you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, all right.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined playing once in a great rock band for over 20 years, and that seems like a dream.
We also continue to focus on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like ourselves and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We're lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we've always wanted to visit.
Things could not be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the time of birth of the grene?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band comes out of a city, but it's already unusual if five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound guards on their tour. We are looking forward to being still friends with them all and it is honored to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) hit us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being happy to be still alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, so musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. It could not be better for us.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it's too easy to fall down this game with huge crowds that love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what they have created, without failing to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible person Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose to open?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks.
Who was you influenced as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first ones I figured out are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grue alive, although it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned before, for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that could seem a little easy to do. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive on themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard how Ed played them.
I think if you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embodie that to me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, 25-year-old prison for human rights violations during his government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operating four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would be investigated for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to identify the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that he thought Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he considered him innocent.
He was surgeryd four times in tongue cancer and lost 18 kg of weight. There are also other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his period of government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official deployment led by the President of Uruguay José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica meets with his Mexican official colleague Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the President of Uruguay, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support for the incident with France when the French government leader Nicolas Sarkozy at the G20 summit in the city of Cannes put the South American country on a list of tax paradises.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear as tax paradises from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and brought a question to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid duplication with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is the subject of countries that have not introduced all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been established at a commercial level since 2004, which has contributed to an increasing trade of goods between the two countries.
The cordy installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for the salvation of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser for 25 years, but never until now in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the stores of all over the world this month has been tailored to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the person responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain when performing the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed for this console from the beginning" , because so far success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "expensive" video game that allowed a quick, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "simply" to capture the less scratched users.
Afterwards, the experts can turn a "second round" via the various game legs that become increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects" always must be played three-dimensionally.
This Super Marios trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo swings to the fans of Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The sneaky installer has to overcome the platforms with dangers to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about movements, the environment, distractions and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy of $70 million in money laundering.
Thus, the trial ends through the US's request for Portillo's extradition, so that it can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his Government he had not intervened in court decisions and accepted all requests for extradition which he was notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if his legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his time of government. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was set up to avoid marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social assistance organisation have led to important results: in this quarter-century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was set up in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of training, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu, numerous officials of institutions and institutions who worked with the association in these 25 years took part.
The participation of political representatives from different directions in electoral campaigns demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist minister of education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalonian Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today’s times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that is white to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
Occupied house in which giant parties were organized was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building last afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on the street of Balmes have found an end.
Twelve people volunteered to leave the building that they held illegally and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place on a judicial order without any police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
" From now on, access will be controlled," the housekeeper confirmed.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They had also painted the walls and left all kinds of waste, especially bottles of alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and the tenants were driven to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, declared Europe Press that her business would have declined by 80% since the beginning of the home occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had been indicated by the neighbors for rest disorder, while according to her statement of noise, not by the visitors of the disco, but by the housekeepers and especially by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the said angry neighbors, have become more and more in recent weeks.
The Discothec responsible stated that the harassment was so large that it agreed with the owner of the building that no rent had to be paid for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (City Police) also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from the neighbours.
Last week, the president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked to clear the building immediately and to tackle the problems of civic coexistence and the downturn of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months the housekeepers had been precedenced in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it was necessary to put an end to impunity and to persecute the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was erected by the Catalonian police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the tender, apart from the disputes about the awards.
The urban invitation to tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the peak of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its scourge about the promotion of Collserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the New York Central Park.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became again the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not spreading in the north-south direction, but upwards (mounts) and downwards (mere).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, not the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogi bear.
So far, when the city issued a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola in September.
Undoubtedly a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that is the case, or someone intends to put gates on the ground.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to reflection on the city, the discussion theme in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this old caste that meet in the elevator can use.
And that is exactly the fact that provides the substance for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary" after the attack on the coast to talk about the "front on the mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been held about the green apples.
"You should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tor of Collserola" holds a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined "as access to a park, but as the confinement of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be a "intellectual challenge", which poses "some dangers".
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that brings about the design of a public space today" following the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is the own confinement to what can be built.
"To limit something always means to define the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which keeps itself closer to the question, simplifies the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not going towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronate de Collserola that should not "spoke on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "two doubts" as to whether this technical profile should lead the established multidisciplinary teams ("precisely the right," he says) "we architects should be only one tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since the tendering conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "16 competitions have been awarded in cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no long-term perspective that the area is viewing as a whole."
This, at least in his case, has led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his view, the city should absolutely guarantee that the stripes are equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length, creating a soft transition between the city and green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the Casino Red official has forgiven him before the second court of the district, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination of the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is likely to compel him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the contest.
After the prosecution, the prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Panist Mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed at this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the Ministerio Público official had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's detention centre because he allegedly bought the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the Central Security Area, because there were murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as an inmate of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, was sent to him a detention order, which found that after the nearly two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wetthouse in order to open it in return.
On that Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to issue the penalty, so he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Público Ministry of the Court, García Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and who the owner of the contested house had made his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name back.
According to case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely lodged. Also below, no objections against the process can be made, and no compensation is required.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released after hearing the representative of the Competition Hall at 15.50 p.m.
Jorge Yánez, the Secretary of Justice, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he was released and his case would be brought to the records.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the findings of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people died pointed out that the helicopter was directly against the ground with its entire uncontaminated structure without the pilot having been able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, while the helicopter lost the frog seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he met all the conditions for the transportation of the staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the field where the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has an impact of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to obtain the findings as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Aeroplane and auxiliary services Secretariat in Mexico), assured that the helicopter flew from Estado Mayor Presidencial during flight speed attack and that the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of the collision it was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the Head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visibility flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the sight flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient vision during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, some deep-hanging clouds emerged.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had selected a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley due to the clouds.
Bombing point:
The collision coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter are consistent. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the collision.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available at this time indicates that the helicopter was blown straight and sideways.
The pattern of the dispersed aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was crashed on the ground with its unframed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the accident site neither fire nor explosion.
The latest findings indicate several soil contacts.
In the on-site investigations, parts of aircraft were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The site is abrupt and has a shock of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minor search in an area that went beyond the locked area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts were found, which reinforces the assumption that the uncontaminated aircraft structure was crashed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for finding the gene for obesity
She runs a research project on finding the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene of obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" to identify genetic markers associated with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Medical Research Department, Focus Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritional specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested persons can come to the IMSS sports sites in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation started on the Cuauhtémoc sports site (west of the state of Mexico) and continued since 8 October on the Nezahualcóyolt sports site (east of the state of Mexico).
When the target is reached from 500 to 600 investigators, the study will be continued on the sports site of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the site of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn from factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the World Diabetes Day he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 should complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that may lead to diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He further concluded that on the above Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes associated with obesity at child age).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out in response to the concern of health care workers about the alarming increase in young people's weight.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of fatty boys increased by 77 percent and the proportion of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Also, overweight increased dramatically," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He claimed that an (e) Mexican (in) average was 65 per cent of Indian-American, 30 per cent of European and 5 per cent of African origin, which was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
Generally speaking, he explained that the genetics of obesity were expressed in the inability to burn out the surplus of energy (calorie), so that it was stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the subjects would be a comprehensive study of the children to determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the presence of dark skin folding in the neck and in the inner arm (acanthosis) indicating the likelihood of metabolism disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spend most of the day before TV and use transport equipment, instead of walking short paths.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburgers, etc.), along with a high fat and protein intake, as well as genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt prevents blowholes from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM developed modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs that go out of the road surface were respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 holes if the rainy time at the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the city area of the valley of Mexico) broke out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that if the occurrence and maintenance of the asphalt layer were appropriate, the number of holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Technical loopholes", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road floor and thus avoid the emergence of strike holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most difficult part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malts. Together, they give the road cloth its characteristic zehelastic behaviour.
Zehelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very smooth and at 50°C fast, while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes on one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road coating consisting of six materials layers, of which the last three were asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a sliding layer of asphalt, consisting of small stones baked in asphalt and then fortified.
Each single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and produce forces, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "is a last layer designed, the so-called wear layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it has to friction.
The most of the strengths of this road covering is received and distributed, the bearing layer also needs an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into account, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the site gets wet, water enters the layer and only becomes difficult to return. This causes a revitalization of all layers of the road surface and consequently the appearance of blowholes.
"When a blowhole arises," he said, "it will first be carried off the ceiling layer, while the wear layer will only be affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained with the first signs through appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican National Research System) said that the vehicle load was another important cause for hit holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road coating should always be proportionate to the vehicle load and it should be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent hit holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research was still waiting, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the blowholes could be repaired easily and without application of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the factors that had the effect that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner's stage, presenting a silver crown and the band she showed as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result received that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the departamento already comes on 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the mistakes promulgated include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her to the first miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has most influenced you and why?" which Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing myself, in the end I think that the book, which was most marked for my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a rather deep book.
At the moment I read `Debt and Congratulations'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russin, a beautiful book called `passiones'.
An answer that hit little reluctance, first of all because of the term 'civilize yourself' and second of all because she had not explained concretely in what way each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the end of the ceremony Melina said that she would feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people: Please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota argued that the fact that she was the preferred one who had received all the applause and received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous, which the queen stressed, which could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed at their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two elevators at the crowning party.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and the momentum that Magdalena and Atlántico represented.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was crowned to the miscarriage "hows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not finally become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have his reason for two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on social feelings, that she had been involved in projects before participating in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis that were noted to her in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which was honestly hard to notice for me, printed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the magazine Cromos believed that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them do the right thing.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Due to this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was created after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was to be observed in the night. It was overwhelmed that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price in order not to bring them into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina begins her year of reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano was
A Lophoscopist from Cali entered history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a Lophoscopist of the Investigation Unit of the Public Prosecutor (CTI) from Cali was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had preparedness service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to travel to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he had to identify.
In 2000 he settled in Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialised in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was the suspicion that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be one. Therefore, he should take the ten finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the test, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lug, ink, plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body’s fingerprints with those on the print sheet.
He had seen right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On Track Search
For a dactyloscopic of Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robberies and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false ID documents or do not have any.
We'll take the fingerprints from them and find them in the database.
The scientist told us that he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house in the event of a thief, because the thief had supported himself right here with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprint removal. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thieves," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, suspicious persons can also be unloaded or loaded.
Recently a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of snaps.
In the investigation it was suspected that a family member could be suspected, and in fact a fingerprint was consistent on the bottle.
Although this is not guaranteed that it is the murderer, he is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist said that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be removed from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or band is used to take.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to Asif, this is the criminal database, or to the personal office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without IDs," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was the same as it was presented in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is that shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "fighters" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered together in tents on the Zuccotti place.
Most of them came after the evacuation order and changed their location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called out the New York authorities this Tuesday when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the Manhat Square after they had been removed from the square in the morning and had tried to occupy another place on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators came together in front of the Zuccotti place, on which they wanted to join with a judicial order that allowed the "immediates" to reopen tents in this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement kept on the clearance order and occupied a park further north in the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to the toccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the answer of the "fighters" to the evacuation of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent evasion of the place and authorizing the demonstrators to tent.
They also occupied a new park located on the crossing of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least one hour, but the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give accurate numbers. He assured Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had found themselves in this place, where a deposition of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support to members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti place (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, in which the legality of the evacuation that took place in the morning is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small collisions", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square and the application of "compositions adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that this judicial order has lifted the reopening of the place for public transport and the demonstrators. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti place carried out in the morning, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "would violate the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to cause damage to others", because "some shops would have received threats" and the residents feared "of their quality of life".
"The excavation in the morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "no respecting the freedom of the press".
The officials of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organizing "large actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have taken since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary at the Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian fame, she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadier Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Canadian television Christmas show.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (balade singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will invade a very special virgin Maria life.
Today, CTV disseminated pictures of the television program in which Anderson - which also appears for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-drawn porn, in which she and her former husband, the drummer player of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appear as a virgin Mary with a doll in the foot that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, recently appeared as a moderator of the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" program by Charlie Sheen, as a Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, in one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called the North American woman Kim Kardashian "Hur".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake, which led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced during World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo evaluated the material damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the gross domestic product data used to finish this chapter from July to September: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year's high rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The resurrection can be explained partly by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first drop after six months of continuous increases.
Nevertheless, the actual change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
In particular, Japan is awakened thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increasing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, after the Yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "flight currency" of investors who flee before the debt crisis of the euro area and the rude forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September to the Yen quotation.
While markets continue to occupy the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"You must pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid revaluation of the yen," said yesterday the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator, which precedes the turning points of the world economy, showed that the brake would have been drawn with the greatest economic potential.
Because it fell by four tenths up to 100.4 points in comparison to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average of 100, after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Makes Conflict Resurrection
Papadimos says that the saving measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and the growing uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth, which stems from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon during his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, in no way, withdraw his demand for new elections at the scheduled date of February 19th.
"The main task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law of officials and new measures to combat tax evasion.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not express doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The Conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million that Athens needs urgently. He made it clear that he would not agree to a declaration of commitment to the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But yesterday, the European Commission, who is still annoyed by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated that its demand was not to be reluctant: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties were not to sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what was necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knee has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing.
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the role of microfinance in the world".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain recalled that Spain has developed as the second donor in the last two decades of the world for this means of international cooperation, whose "Wesen" relies on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on trust in human beings".
The queen yesterday announced the fifth World Summit on Microcredits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubts" that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living the number of people living with income of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty limit".
Spain "continues to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and is responsible for carrying out this task," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" will be guaranteed as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "we face many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for the launch of "two basic objectives".
The queen stated that it was intended that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty limit.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of microcredits is based on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an act of justice and recognition.
To the father of this financial instrument, she described it as a "admirable idealist, who was committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All of them "we can observe continuous development," the queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday presented her assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as "speaker of the poor".
Finally, the queen Sofia concluded her speech by stimulating the participants to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is a "ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic boom because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credits were "a severe and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised states now "more than ever" would have to work on solidarity criteria and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, complained of "success", "marginized" people, "which are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and to the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the visitors in a city that opened "his gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, went for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democrat Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it continued in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and perhaps Italy as too lax tomorrow.
The draft Presidency of the European Commission proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, and ten had abstained.
The several minutes of Standing Ovation, which, as a result of their intervention, initially applied to Angela Merkel and a few hours later to Wolfgang Schäuble, had no doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The key idea of the Chancellor - as well as the applications - is the following: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by an amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union in terms of the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, but this could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face."
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood with Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly, it is little likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, delegates, with an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal to weight each country in the Executive Board of the ECB in accordance with the weighting of each economy, which would obviously lead to a reinforcement of the position of Germany.
The Chancellor, who was looking for a calming climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
In so far as the European application devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
For this reminds us that Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon army.
What does fraud represent in the case of sickness reports?
According to family support, UMP and government are now taking on sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family aid fund and talk about the issue of combating social fraud and economic dependence on the state - which has been repeated since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in hardship, but on the other hand, it is not less precedence of a right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on reports of workers' disease.
First of all with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth day of carence before taking into account a sickness report to employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the permission of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to invoke anger, but would help to invest 280 million euros.
And that with another action would be more symbolic: to grant the government officials an unremunerated Karenztag in the case of illness (to date, unlike the three carenzdays in the private sector, there is no karenzfrist for them).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority is also relaunching the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse of work.
"Kontrolls will be much more important, and in addition, these repayments are to be paid if this is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13th, before the RTL broadcaster's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraud in the field of health reports seems somewhat disproportionate.
It has indeed been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as of political offensives, which have been the most frequent fruit.
The French are not more commonly ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, we shall first stay with the national figures.
According to CNAM, over 237 million euros of daily disbursements were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the daily allowances in 2008 accounted for EUR 11.3 billion 5% of health expenditure.
Among these were 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And therefore, 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, according to an Alma Consulting Group study, the French were granted on average only 14.5 days of sickness compared to 17,8 days in 2009.
An average that conceals certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 interviewed, French workers reported that they had not taken one day of illness.
Another study recorded this time by health insurance shows that 37% of sickness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no longer likely to be incapacitated than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global attendance rate (based on disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of sickness reports represents a disappearingly small proportion of black labour.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak measure is achieved.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systemic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (public university for the training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 realised short-term sickness reports, which were in 37.050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the systematicly controlled cases of disease reports of more than 45 days, less than 1.2 million 11% were counted in "unadapted or unjustified" cases, which is 132.000.
In total, this makes 169 000"unjustified" cases on several million workers who have claimed a sickness report.
A figure that represents only a weak outlook towards, for example, those of black labour.
According to MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 and EUR 15 billion per year of tax profit, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to close its economy.
This had been announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament on Monday, 14 November, in addition to the fact that the one hundred days of his government from the Union were not sufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on the Parliament's vote on confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, since the participation of the country within the euro area was at stake, as it added.
In line with this, Mr. Papademos has planned to reduce the government deficit of the country"by 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new savings measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had forwarded that his party would not be willing to take further steps.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary assembly of his party New Democracy.
He had expressed his willingness to reduce budgetary deficits and debts, as well as to combat waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, an EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from delivering the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, had answered Antonio Samaras that his word would be sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from Auβen.
Euthanasia and accompanying free death must be legalized, according to an expert body
Canadians live in denial of death, as a report of the Royal Society of Canada shows
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated in providing the best pain-reducing medicines, and this beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and take disposition for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in order to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in the case of patients considered capable of making such a decision.
As a start, the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the Earthball.
Although Canada has ranked on the 10th, the study notes that "the medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain-feeding drugs, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
The rate of 86% of deaths in the hospital in Quebec is the highest from all countries.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are counterfeit to the position of the federal government, which has already declared no amendments to the penal law concerning euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
Now, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach Euthanasia and accompanying suicide have legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practical implementation of Euthanasia or accompanying suicide by incompetent or non-convicious persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such infringements, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, a member of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadies support Euthanasia
We realise that, according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already agreed in favour of Euthanasia, as they believe they would allow people at the end of their lifetime to mitigate their sufferings.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalization of Euthanasia does not mean that the message is that the life of older or disabled people is less valuable.
With regard to persons who have already practised an accompanied suicide, the respondents 41% believe that they should not be prosecuted under criminal law.
The authors of the report say that the situation is less clear in terms of maintaining or adjusting the medicines in patients.
They also suggest in their recommendations that the Penal Law should state that the termination of the funds for which a lawful rejection has existed should not be regarded as criminal.
The expert body also calls for training health professionals in the task of respecting the withdrawal of funds at the end of their lives, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated in providing the best pain-reducing medicines, and this beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, the panel calls for consideration of the treatment of pain relief or life-saving measures already widely applied in the Canadian health institutions, at least as they were not used to reduce physical pain as well as euthanasia, and they refer to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporter's experts as "extreme", among other things, since they do not set any limits to the euthanasia practice in the final phase.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years asks another person to help him with his suicide," says RA Deschamps, who yesterday had seen a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also emphasises that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all the other values involved in the social effect of society.
Now, he says, would there be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she supported as "Pro-Euthanasia Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports regarding the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign power
Damascus advocates a "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auβen Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, which, thanks to the support of Russia, resists it and shows a "complete" against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League left Syria, the European Union has intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II. Of Jordan yesterday was the active Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Baschar al-Assad to "deploy his authority in Syria" in which forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Baschar had the interest of his country in heart, he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Diplomatic Chief Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned by success.
"These people in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and who cannot satisfy this must go," he pointed out on Syria, the neighbouring country, to whom Turkey is taking a strolling attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit an increasingly sharpening tone in the face of the repressions in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government were killed in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the occupied city of Homs during "choppings and serious bombings around Jobar".
At a press conference, however, the Syrian Minister for Trade Walid al-Muallim considered that the country "taxes to the end of the crisis".
He has, by the way, reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which he considers is a "hazardous step".
Syria"will not be surrendered," he added under the tribulation that "the merged plot against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes the dispatch of 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
Alain Juppé, the French Minister for Trade in Australia, also spoke in favour of the deployment of UN observers in order to protect civilians from the repression of the regime, that he is encapsulated in his "Paranoia".
A new league meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the emergence of crisis adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial and expected withdrawal of military troops from the occupied cities and the release of inmates.
The Russian Minister Sergej Lawrow identified yesterday the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect" in order to avoid any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls for the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian Head of Government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "opfers" to recover the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's trade unions and employers' association.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which consists of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had been waiting for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will be summits in the presentation of a list of deletion, presented by Mr Monti, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen ministers to Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that yesterday the nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed in the comment that it would be "certain that the markets will be clear and comprehensible".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The current Prime Minister should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he appreciated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's credentials by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself to working urgently in order to make Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman from Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013 despite the savings plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia,"Chief of the Chiefs of Italy," who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic growth," because a country that has no growth, cannot respect the deficitious figures."
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of time" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolises the "demand of trust" as well as a "other Italy", according to the authors.
The great unknown in this would be the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferential elections, since Italy will now have to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran’s nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon explosive capsule, confirms an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The IAEA announced last week its "unfortunate concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the IAEA documents from ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for more than three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he would have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev which produces "Nano diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA mentioned that the Iranian development of a nuclear explosive system had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only in this technology, but, as a member of the Agency informed, had worked his entire career directly on this technology in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and delicts have increased by 50%
The crimes and delicts against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes of violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either slightly declined or only slightly increased during the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims had risen by 49% in 2009 from 107 to 160 in 2010, whereas there had been a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in Jewish crimes and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
According to the FBI, the total number of "hat motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak manner, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," emphasised Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," said the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, considering that this could be done in order to improve the police attitude towards the "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the U.S. federal law is an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence against race, skin colour, religion or origin and now also include crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter changes the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable their users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again resemble the one of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readable live tracking of the activities of other "twitters", the Internet user whose messages are tracked ("Tweets") and who track your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, promote certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu had been tested with a small percentage of users before its general Internet dissemination on Monday"in August", said the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, embedded with something esotherisch anmutend text (RT for the referenced Repeat of the contributions of another person). followfriday to recommend to follow another user) giving the happiness of the initiators, thus opening up to a wider audience with a more comparable management to that of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "Tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive and equals too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "activity" will help me to track certain elements of my flux Twitter better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Ensuring a "golden budget rule" in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the large social-democratic/Christian coalition in Austria has decided to incorporate a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the Top-Bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was very personally the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public government debt of Austria is 74.6%, i.e. far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the level of debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payability did not fall to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of additional interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government would at that time have called for the introduction of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public balance of accounts into the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measures taken by the Austrian Government to this end are similar to the German model, since Germany was the first European country to have included such a "regulation" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of GDP each year, and from 2017 the federal government's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the currency markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the currency markets if the Yen continued to rise.
"If we should establish excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did the last time," said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again near to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is about to control a new record value compared to the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen steadily above, dotted by purchases of investors who view the yen as a "fuction value" in these unsafe times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro was swept under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had rigged the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This stroke of the Japanese currency damages the export of the archipelago, since it increases the costs of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn from Japanese companies abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (North East), for its reconstruction," says Mr. Noda, who fears that this tribulation of the yen could already kill the weak resurrection in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter -, the third world economic power has again gained attraction for the first time this year thanks to the steep export growth and consumption of the "plobed" households due to the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, appreciates that the tarification of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
On the other hand, Finance Minister Jun Azumi invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to deter the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has, however, informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", which makes it clear that no additional monetary locking is expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Bank had increased its public bond purchases by 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion Euros) to offset the 55,000 billion Yen (519 billion Euros) of cover that it had used for various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet fast to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the debt crisis continually ends the European indicators.
Despite the instigation of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries are continuing to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are still running off a bit more in negative files this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10:00 and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions regarding the returns of government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, for its part, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a decrease of 0.7%.
"Japan has been looking at Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trade is moving to a limited range of variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, estimates.
This resurrection of the concern about the future of the euro area damages the single currency, which continues on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 Dollers, so it dropped by 0.4%.
According to the exchange brokers, it declined after the CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted an application which, in particular, provided for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's loan interest rates continue to be at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 6.85% of the 10-year-old, the return of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to nourish the fears of investors.
The future Italian government leader Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his Government.
Spain is located in the market visir, as the parliamentary elections will take place in the country on Sunday.
The "spread" between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has again reached a new, historical high.
In anticipation of growth rates in the euro area
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% due to household consumption in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the lowers in the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that makes the economic experts the most concerned.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first repayment of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m. and the European Commission warns against the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win about dogms
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to discuss this issue as well as the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world population should not have to abandon a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue which has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to waive nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only some countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided to join another unit in their park after the nuclear accident, re-operating the Three Mile Island plant.
Although the German model, which is focused on renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as an example, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The Berlin election will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence, particularly on Russia, increased by the increased use of imported gas, and the increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power stations.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case in Denmark gives reason for reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European table leader for wind energy, from which it accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used in turn with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role in competitiveness and a stability pane of industry on national soils, France's companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not as willing to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us understand that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial sector with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them create numerous jobs.
If France decides to step out of nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be victims of this, and the EUR 6 billion annual investment goods and nuclear exports would become more and more constrained.
Which electrician would assign an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is as little as a devil work as a miraculous means of producing electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperial for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that performs uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have made themselves a name due to their professionality, are just obsessed with the safety presentation.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions and did so without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was raised by the construction of the reactor as well as innocenceable human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has been caused by unprecedented mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation of the safety authorities of French and German operators and engineers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that allows it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fantastic gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free train to travel the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy buquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotional, dogma and party maneuvers to dominate a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is Immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had called itself.
Recently, the insult against foreign students from the public side had marked the weeklights, the Minister of the Interior had occasionally announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "no talent, Maurer or waiter from abroad needed".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this subject.
On the right hand, the sound of Jacques Chirac was struck, which declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrants, should not be a problem for a country", on the left hand by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, could not absorb the entire world's poverty."
The only difference is the degree of accessibility
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish connectors was divided in 2005 from both the right and the left.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of agility to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his program, is limited to banality, which suggests that partnership development allows us to solve our "migratory problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As we are represented by economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recently published work that summarises the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the influx of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Reducing immigration would deter growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace local workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage workers, since they are working in sectors that are unloaded by work.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that travel low-skilled domestic wage workers, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the supply of employment.
Positive pay effect
Like a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthesia, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the national labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the influx of immigrants results in a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is beneficial (high proportion of citizens of immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute netly to social systems, with an average of around 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who is 30 years old emigrates to Germany will contribute a net contribution of around EUR 150,000 over his lifetime to the public budget.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing cutting points "with the teeth" to the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which the immigrants should discourage, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed the whole 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was rich to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible to see democracy defeated forever over their enemies.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one", that it was a characteristic of the attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can also become the "oppression instrument" as expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of the powers, training, education, economic and social community spirit, and a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we are in is an economic crisis, but it is as much as it is and, first of all, political and democratic crisis.
The change in the spirit of the Greek True-False Referendum would have had a double discerning character in this respect: once again, the need for a strong return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the worrying feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be regarded as obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised in the light of the needs and in the wrong order.
A free licence for the European sole ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the emptyness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, entirely rightly, clear and consistently, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we know no longer where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is throughout Europe that is bowed by the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus each of the individual nations that belongs to it.
The urgency is to give back to the national sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is at the heart of whether the Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, get free from the markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on a condition that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without surely causing us to destroy.
After this proposal has been fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today urges European economic governance.
Agreed.
But imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it deals with the citizens - would be another foolishness and another hole.
We need to take a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not afford enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to create a Europe that is better integrated at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe from a political point of view, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Uncontacted" chipcards become general good
The world trade fair for chip cards opens its doors in a optimistic position in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards phone), with more than 6 billion sold units.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold before a year, this year 460 million contactless chip cards are to be sold worldwide!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chipcard market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins in terms of contactless payments to land, after it has been behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary that banks equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to providing their customers with bank cards that are equipped with a contactless chip in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Testing Payment by Mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A distantly small percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology required to carry out these transactions.
"They've been delayed."
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also announced yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long-standing relationships between the al-Qaida terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers had now gained "consciousness".
"The way in which both organizations operate, as well as the relationships between the intelligence services, indicate clear cooperation," he said without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January has supported interfaces at present.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, are expected to have been killed on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the ruins at the site.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria who had stopped the weighing of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but we must certainly wait for clearer evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's possible, though."
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it is becoming increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo alleviates.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as well as the speeches and the operating mode of Boko Harem, which now point to the attraction of suicide perpetrators and the use of ever more complex explosives that wear the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, in order to begin with Washington, has been exercising pressure on Abuja since that time to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long seen the grouping as a community of illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Quick Success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the surroundings of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means as much as "western education is a shame" - is following the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
The merger is rapidly successful in this undeniable region.
She politises and demands strict respect for the sharia, while her affiliated activists engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram showed themselves particularly actively with their reinforced attacks on the Commissioners.
However, Abuja's reaction is as usual indifferentiated.
The army surrounded the city, counting 800 dead.
The Mohammed Yusuf captured is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its highburgs in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which called for 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was assigned the guilt of a suicide attack that occurred at the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became the priority international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has been anxious to all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger have occupied Somalians operating in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned Jonathan in Nigeria of Boko Harem at a conversation with President Goodluck and was willing to give all the advice."
The world with the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-affected America lead a complex world with simple, not to say, single ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their controversies have repeatedly made their statements and statements on außen policy, a traditional Republican focus.
China, Iran and Israel's help fall - often in no way supported - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to address them to the "value manipulation" - leading theme in an America that is first irritated by the migration of all industries to Asia.
It was stupid if this meant the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama, and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auβen policy, has almost shrinked the air with regard to his flattering gesture of emotion.
He had called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being heard because he stagnates in the depths of polls.
Reagan's Ebenbild
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll put an end to Iran," he had pointed out.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel reinforced military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of commitments to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranking candidate, is presenting a disgraceful knowledge of the files.
Recently he called for the Chinese military threat to be counterfeit, since Beijing's attempts to develop nuclear power - and seemed to be aware of the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, for his part, to be prepared to employ the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against courageous terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a political weight.
Against the current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was also an amateur and had to give water in his wine on the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive twin talk with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this adversity is not so uncomfortable.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security among Obama, which Bin Laden has shut down.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself from military interventions leading to paralysis.
And Obama is more appropriately surprised by the argument that America must be rebuilt economically in order to raise its leadership position to new life.
Nord Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to take this event with shine and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, lived last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestral control and at a fine-savoured buffet the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch official colleague Mark Rutte have symbolically turned together the control of the valve, which transportes the Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gases per year through a first pipeline of 1.224 km long, which connects the Sankt Petersburg region to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - will be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already let the possibility of the construction of a third line ring on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and point-specific completion of this huge building is like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the landways.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little power: for them it is now more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, which was most involved in the debate, was not reversed before comparing the Nord-Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically too sensitive.
West Europe has gained even greater security of supply through its support for this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a decommissioning of European energy, as the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas stocks are inclined to do so in just five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed in the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out the extent to which large gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the Lubmin Gazprom managers in terms of gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, in about 200 m depth.
When it was built, mine fields dating from World War II had to be removed.
"Around hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesman of Nord Stream.
In addition, intensified measures to protect the fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which has been interrupted by nothing throughout the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in front of Sweden's coast, but the project managers have abstained from it, since Sweden was little inclined to see a Russian state company reside in a permanent manner at the level of their coasts.
"In the case of a havarie, we will close the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered to be unlikely by the designers, as the welding seams were estimated to be stable to a leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both a underwater robot controlled by a seaship for external observation purposes, and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, which measures a metre diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of further movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without having to undergo the least repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF are also affiliated (to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company group GDF Suez (to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company company called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire capacity of this company for its gas transport, on an extended twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the size of the volume of gas actually transported," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, since Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline emerges on a sandy, pine forested coastline with Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas exit splashes.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskin, a brand notebook.
Started about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskin now wants to give the letter new style.
It has a flair of adventures, spent hours on candles with the writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber band, the egg-coloured sides, as ageed over time.
However, the Moleskin notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, at that time decided to market a distinctive design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert adviser of the company, is responsible for the introduction of the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called Mole Skin (maulworm skin), which is a cotton coat, used for example for polster benches.
This type of notebook was very asked among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has restored an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and were established with a sales of 12,7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskin passes the Italian border and is exported into 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook enthusiasts businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultural and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers and understands to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite the upswing of the emails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also put a band of leopard patterns on the market at the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer housings... The brand displays the entire range of articles.
A success that brings jealousy to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus introduced a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today, the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled persons is always twice as high as the average: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, who is preparing the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"The unemployment rate was not twice as high as three times then."
"However, there's still a lot to do."
However, it must be said that many obstacles persist for disabled unemployed before they get a job.
More commonly, older people are 37% older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a degree and there are only 10,000 disabled persons among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of disabled persons compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work and which constitute the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a group founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much to the physical brakes.
Stay the unprecedented, the mental attitudes, which certainly develop, but slowly.
A study carried out in April by the Association of IMS-Enterprise for the magazine La Cité stated that the interviewed managers have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which is "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less mediated".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, as set out in a 1987 Act.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now with about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of "cost-paying" establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real knowledge, especially among large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments employ between 20 and 49 persons with disabilities, whereas companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard:"What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 a.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasure that brought them the friendship game.
It would have gone too far to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Situating side by side on the audience stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to close peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had only earned praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller for his part.
As far as the contrast between his representation in club and national eleph is concerned,"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year long, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania in respect of the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "goodness".
He fired the French national team since the age of 7 years, and led his victorious field trains between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This will inevitably help to strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he represents.
"We just walked over the road."
"To be able to play is great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, sounds with good humility "stole".
"The pride to carry a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbors" - that France" has again become a team at a very high level, and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done damn good work," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician will very well see the plane sharing with the blue (the French national eleph) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice this in the coming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
With great optimism, the Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward to the replay against Bosnia this Tuesday at 22:00 a.m. in Lisbon.
During the play, both teams had missed the materiality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national eleph, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that actually means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, Bosnia.
Given the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the party over more than an hour, but the team was unable to print the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from her.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not reached an outward gate."
At home, however, in their brightly shining stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike themselves in front of a audience, which is likely to be at stake as well, even if the party was of course announced as "very scarce", the optimistic but clear-minded Bento said.
"We expect a very short match, but we are absolutely convinced of being able to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of attending the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The indecision in Bosnia on Friday compels the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
An indeterminate can already suffice to the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not reached the outer gate," regrets Bento.
"We will fight against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have the intention of exercising maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is transposed into action this time.
