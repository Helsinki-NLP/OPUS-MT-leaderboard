Right populists triumphed in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the pre-parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a well-known strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's election leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumph on the political stage at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain the first political force in the country, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, but compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5% of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 per cent per cent almost nine per cent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; the result is literally catastrophic, especially for the People's Party, which launched the early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the voters clearly punished them for having let the government collapse.
As soon as the first reactions to the results were made, speculations concerning the possible resignation of the leader of the party and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could be done on Monday, at the extraordinary council of the party's leadership.
Such a change would first facilitate the way towards the outcome of the most likely election, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ coalition and ÖVP.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FPÖ) would have reached 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a rehearsal of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still united, it was in 2005 that BZÖ separated from it) from a common government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently on this evolution.
The last party to have access to Parliament was the Greens, but they slightly lost and fell from the third to the fifth position among the Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party exceeds the 4% limit and did not accede to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused of illegal cafard harvesting in India could not be resolved, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations would result.
The Minister said this today to New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out after a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, in the coming of talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mulherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and wait for the judgment in free," he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which he could be pardoned," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicted persons with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister mentioned.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," indicated Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomology.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The Minister asked whether he had received the promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech Arbitrator of the Battle for the Bottom of the Sea
It is approaching a wall electronic card, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The idle belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completeness from time to time.
The work ardent and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world not known so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider background than the land closes
The literal states have now begun to strive vigorously for the new submarine territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they actually use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially the area called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, the latter may claim exclusively all resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered as a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles which represent the said exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The request from the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation, based on many prospections and costly metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Committee has addressed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At present, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," says Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its submarine possessions, has recently experienced a global seizure.
New Zealand, too, has won the territory - the extent of the seabed, which the Commission assigned to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospections.
The benefit they will gain in the future from the exploitation of the marine soil will be, as they are projecting, invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will present their demand.
They can do so within ten years of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the oceanic base, proclaimed by the Convention "common heritage of humanity".
At this point, no State has an exclusive position.
The right to extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"No less, do not betray us, the seabed is not a Klondike," said by exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that "the areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the marine base is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the former bloc of the Eastern countries within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from some other States, it obtained the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The investor's prospective area slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved there, it is a sort of submarine replice of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on an extension of a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a range of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee from the division, provides an example of such a concrete situation.
She recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to the legend, was animating the Golem.
German special forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's assistance in solving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9, federal police and federal criminal police officers, as well as technical Hilfwerk logistics experts were at the release site.
As the spokesman of the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were ultimately not required, the hostages having released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the impediment of a release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on-site as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," said a spokesperson from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The aggressors had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction into the desert in southern Egypt, hostages were transbahuted in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostages has remained vague until now, as well as the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have in the meantime arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
At the moment in Berlin, no information was provided on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the "Image" magazine, the five vacancies and special forces should have landed on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives of the United States rejects the rescue plan
The United States Congress's first chamber has made little failure to the $700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones was in the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the United States Chamber of Representatives rejected the rescue plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by the President of the United States George W. Bush and the leaders of the two parties, the program that had to juggle the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favourable vote, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones had over six per cent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could cover.
It came back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting new serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Members and the Senate are necessary.
Organisers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the next months, according to a study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite low economic prospects, the Germans' thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period in the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencys (DRV) told Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, growing booking figures already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, sales would have risen to approximately 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the DRV.
Sources of these results are GfK figures, which analyzes monthly booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be registered there.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, said the DRV.
Here, the increase in bookings would be approximately one Third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be specially sought by the Germans.
Specially organized travel is very demanding, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs here would be "easier to calculate for the customer than for an individual tour organized".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusivie offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well held so that sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann's or Apres-Ski's continuous hits, beer in literal spots and celebrities in Tyrolian designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television animator and wears a tailor-made tyrolian costume.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers go down on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this at my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrol costume seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of the beer party and living normally north of the whitewurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on the Thérèse Square, everything is half less worse.
Each or almost wears a tyrolian costume or leather trousers; no one looks shameful or shameful - it's completely normal.
Only the tablier of my Tyrolian costume harvests some strange eye hits at the stand of the bananas-chocó.
A Bavarian note that I would have wrongly attached my tab: "on the left means free, in the midst of the virgin, on the right, on the back of the widow."
Discretely, I triple my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she tells me and laughs.
Others don't do so much harm for these subtle flirt techniques and wear simple fireplaces, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and expose their naked rear train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds this "bugy," with a "ooooo" lying.
He tells me all this after he was lightened by the chope he had drunk before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wilder lovers".
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rescue ribs run on the place of the party and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses are more likely to be dooming - always by four, dragging their cubes covered with tents in tents.
It works this way for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we go back full of it.
Those who are resting in the coffin of the drunk under the rod are not visible.
"These are those who can't eat anything anymore," shouts one of the helpers in answer to my question and then disappears in the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the accident of Friday afternoon, in town, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died there.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspected of dangerous driving.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its hinterland.
On the east side of Bosphore, at 20 steps, Asia may be one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is placed on horse riding at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its angles, such as some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is ruined.
But once inside the flagged billetterie, we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delayer in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the country more known as Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its region around, generated by the freeze borders of the Froid War, is over.
. The British and the empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the German Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
The Turkish sources state that this is a sabotage.
Since then, it is slowly ruined, swallowed in history's tales.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, are used to highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The Republic of Justice and Development, the ACP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region around, generated by the freeze borders of the Froid War
Now it's time for a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish Government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went on board a bed wagon in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish ACP MP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half-hour trip, shaken on sound rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital-presented as a new city of a new century state, turning back to its German past.
But the ACP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of changing Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the ACP headquarters, an ultra modern structure, specifically built in stones and steel, in a developing quarter, surrounded by half-built commercial centers and many bakery shops in which middle men and women's wear costume managers meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an abnormality," he said.
Turkey has been cut from its back country.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But here at some point, "I asked if" Turkey shouldn't choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "do not want to have to choose between the two."
He then highlighted an aspect that almost all of those I could talk to have told me in my heart: The Turkish railroad goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a metaphorically traveling Europe on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydrarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought back to these two Germans, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could largely be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories from Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Being already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir had to include the under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years of age refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in form according to mythology) represented the willingness and greed of the choir to manage any kind of music was presented to him, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated us to "say that music speaks for himself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything's here, in music.
So sing!"
His bubble technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
No matter what the musical standard was, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver was to be named a knight, that's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982 when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me and, a few times, they even inspired me
Tod Handley had so rarely this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
He'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (deceased 25 September) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while he was a BSc, MA and PhD."
This is what was derived from a letter from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but that is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time he completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for the Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "the Flamenco and life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magic moments."
Second Attack for Honda Super Sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
In addition, some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be stressed that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation's marketing.
First, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter period than other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Especially in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less than one million cars sold in six years represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thinks to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
Managers of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 jazz in one year.
It is precisely the exit of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely win down sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand leaders hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, which is a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 metres long - on which the nipple company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year around the world.
Based on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned in the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (in addition to five centimeters), its width 1.69 meters (in addition to two centimeters) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change either 1.52 metres.
Dimensions increase and interior space as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a petrol reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the safe - which has a dual background system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity compared to the first generation safe.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the Honda Jazz 1.2L safe capacity is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or the panorama roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the back seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, in relation to the back doors of the first jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline propulsors of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 litres engine develops a power of 90 horses to 6.000 tr/min and 114 Nm torque to 4.900 tr/min.
This propulsor - which on the previous jazz reached 78 horses - has a gasoline consumption of 5.3 litres to 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reached 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres to 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has, this time, inspired nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the robbery of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have made this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Trademark Management, BR23C represents the development of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will prevent collisions for the brand's vehicles.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space in an oval form that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the eyes composed of bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To restore this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles on a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change the direction by biaring its 90 degrees or more wheels to avoid collision.
The greatest difference from any other existing system is that the evasion manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
If so, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Moving Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, nor in diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and delay, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logic of prior manoeuvres, that is why it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB memory.
That may be surprising, but we are not talking about giga-octets of memory, nor even giga-octets."
This is the first to develop new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into the series cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not lacking genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to avoid Americans entering mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's to say 'the Hotel of Bad Credits' ... or stories.
The luxurious aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of Hotel makes us think on several occasions if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, especially, where to do it.
It's sure that this game gives useful but not detailed information.
It's more a play reserved for teenagers.
¿What if the game ends?
As a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's unthinkable to buy yourself a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry on his turn of table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank of Japan, which will pay nine billion dollars to take up 21% of its capital, a new hosted by a strong decline in its stock exchange course.
One week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price selected is less than 19% of the accounting value of securities as at August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current course.
Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 1700 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the banking holding status," said John Mack, the director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but make it go under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirmed that the current financial crisis forced Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japan for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," explained Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, "we thought that the participation would be entirely composed of ordinary actions.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the benefit per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, or approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will allow it to grasp investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, one speaker of the group refused to clarify the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has stated that he has "nettly" lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, who has seen its Stock Exchange course melting half while the cost of insurance against a defective risk on its debt was running.
This cost went back on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "surviving" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Reflect the Republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, it was the third person who put a draft new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64 per cent of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" scored 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it was required to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the outset of the polling stations and a non-governmental organization's count had announced a large victory of the "yes", ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution in the night of Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate headquarters, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in peace in accordance with the Observatory Mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), covered a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution devotes the power of the State to the economy, reserving it the "planning of development" of a country living primarily from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign exchanges sent by its emigrants.
Under the authority of Correa, elected in 2006, the project also provides enhanced powers to the Head of State, which may carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and grant a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty threshold.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack against the grapplers of the eleven tourists and their eight accompanyers caught ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived on board a special plane at the military base of al-Maza, arriving at Cairo's international airport at about 3:30 p.m.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They are in "good health," and "no ransom has been paid" to the rafters," said on the tarmac the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
Captured on 19 September at a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this hostage group had been cast from one hide to the other by 35 unknown ravisers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the attack in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of fires occurred, and half of the rafters were killed, the others fleeing," said the responsible person who called for anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the lighthouse unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces in Belgrade, where he was located.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the day before, the Sudanese army had stated that during a patrol, a 4x4 vehicle was intercepted on which the capturers were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had stated that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the United Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denounced.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is being held and is engaged in this election campaign.
Good.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to declare the amount of poverty given to small museums, archives, archaeological searches or national historical places that are starving?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half euros on the restoration of Chinon's only castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, elected and government departments, and that in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers, grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy, are concerned with the search of history, the preservation of with three private archive monks and the preservation of archaeological remains.
They, often, are the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When do you see a tribune for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Holland bank, as the first European banking institution in distress due to the snowball effect of the US credit market crisis, by nationalizing it partially. The three countries are supporting this financial and insurance institution with interest in Hungary, with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis has been increasing for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will repay nearly half of the bank's capital (of 49%) in each country.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its shares, including, first and foremost, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch ABN Amro organization.
Last week, Fortis shares started a dizzy fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to let it go to bankruptcy.
Only on Friday, society's shares fell by 12 per cent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainties of the overseas Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US rescue plan of $700 billion, of being the cause of the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, papers have already been slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new Director General.
The financial organization was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a substantive proposal.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's client circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A frog in the chicken lobster
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that are linked to the use of information on prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is to confide its chicken to a fox" - reminded Richard Dicket, the program creator of the drug prescription, at Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the capital insured in case of damage depend on the health of the present client, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they had learned the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he has easily provided information to the pharmacists about the purchase of the person's medicines in the past eighteen months. From this, the program itself determines what disease the person suffers and what is his health condition.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately places it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no much more to do with the insurer except paperwork. However, there may still be small problems.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat blowing, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must apply for permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacist.
From now on, they are forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failures in the past.
Since recently, some companies have also handled laboratory analysis results, linking them to data on drug use. In this way, they are able to provide an even more precise portrait of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and user control is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope of action extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on expanding the control circle of authorities concerning companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough and that's why he has developed his program even further, which would condition the transmission of data to the sole agreement of the person concerned.
Another question is whether the person concerned is really free to agree or not, since if he refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and ultimately, the chickens depend on the kindness of the fur.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India increase their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other issues, largely global.
Today, a summit will also take place between France and India, where there will be a major issue of cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet succeeded in agreeing on their support for New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
By the way, they did not take too much attention to this issue yesterday at the 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would increase trade by two, which means an increase of more than EUR 100 billion.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be a too ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civilian flights, which will also allow air trade to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among the EU's partners.
The Summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need to hold a United Nations conference on this.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a major role to play in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its emissions of toxic substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as on the need for a global market at the next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State today travels to the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt Book International Exhibition.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt Book International Salon awaits this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 million titles in exhibition, and Turkey as a guest of honour.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Structure, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospective figures on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing from total Italian production, in particular from adult and child production.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane escape, the billionaire missing on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
Debris were found on a 3000 metres high plateau, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset traveled on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or around.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of detectors sent to the site identified the device a few hours after the escape was detected: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset departed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal properties were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes residence.
These are two documents with the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of the Illinois, of the kind of money and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world's tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of single flight.
Three years later, he had made the world's tour on a plane and without a stop.
Among all these records, also the one that stole at 15.445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, with further surfaces and net angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk, the last born off road "compacts" of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of innovation in this sector.
Just because of its non-standard content, unexpected and non-conventional will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the showroom Mercedes-Benz, from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising battage that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented communication mode, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milan shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real and tridimensional format.
In fact, we will have the impression that when we look at the image, the auto gets out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposition into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of motorised communication.
Will it agree with this formula to raise the interest of the acquiring futures? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
Triveneto, they're risking Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, until now, has never created major problems.
Never had been confronted with the opposite tifosi.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padoo, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, they added small groups (not really) of Campania and Publia.
They had tricolored flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday night, they were all kidnapped in order not to be identified.
They are inspired by English tiphotry.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifoserie of true Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available the Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the party: all nominative, and thus easy to control.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stage.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stage crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and then take measures: in this case, it may be possible that the tifosi arrested or identified in disorders purify a Daspo for at least five years.
An international daspo that prohibits attending the Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot at the stage.
Fortunately.
But now it's time for fear-emulation: it's that others are risking to add to the first hundred and fifty.
"We must immediately turn out this fire, and not legitimately, which is acting like this," the Viminal supports.
So, " Keep your eyes open especially for the Wednesday National Team game in Lecce"
In the Poles there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which are just dealing with the stage problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here's the opinion of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli formerly served as a prefect in Trieste, where a supporter core of the Ultras Italy group was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds Observatory No. 1 - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about sifflets to Mameli's hymn: those too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite..."
