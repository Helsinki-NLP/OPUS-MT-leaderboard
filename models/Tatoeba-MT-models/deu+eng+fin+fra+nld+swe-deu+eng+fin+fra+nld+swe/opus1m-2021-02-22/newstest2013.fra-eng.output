A Republican strategy to counter Obama's reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers it to be a myth, stating that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States have been reported by the Republican lawyers in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments are promulgating new laws that make the registration or voting process more difficult from 2009 onwards.
This phenomenon increased after the November 2010 elections, which saw a rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in the 2011 only year.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identity card and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election, and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with a legal file.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republic's authorities urgently extended this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million voters, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people winning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with photo.
Much more.
Students, who are considered to vote more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Spanish vote.
However, he learns that two out of three Spanish voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, the Republican legislators sponsored laws repealing the registration of voters on the day of the election in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the recording of about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other States to reduce the period of advance voting.
For example, at the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted on anticipation were African Americans, while the voters represented only 13% of the government's voters.
It was the same with the Hispanic.
These represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites who were 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They have been able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requesting the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules introduced will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted and see it as an obvious objective to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: passing the test or not?
In fact, the APS test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men already reluctant to carry out screening tests even more hesitated.
To pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In the United States studies, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European study, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had been tested and those who did not have them.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that there is between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if not detected.
I therefore recommend the test at the age of 50, or at the age of 40, if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
The patient must really be aware of the degree of risk of his cancer by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria are determined with precision to determine who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend that the test be passed.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine if we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool that allows to assess the for and counter for the APS test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone was eating well and moving enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a great thing for people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," deplores spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraged: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of death of cancer falls by half.
Weight
Embunpoint and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophage, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer," adds.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of a colorectal cancer.
The carpentry also, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salating may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the organism's cells and lead to cancer development," explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Take a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
The Boson of Higgs Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson created a whole emo, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is not yet entirely sure that this is the Higgs.
We know without any doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Let's assume that this is the Higgs, because the chances of wrongdoing seem narrow, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this low world, a fatally indispensable law that wants two things not to be found at the same place at the same time.
No way to violate this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantitative state" - this "state" consisting of gross modo in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In a corner there are good citizens named farms, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other, bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for nothing - anyway, not for this principle, which means that they can really be at the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, from the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of strength", through which the great forces of nature spread and to which the bosons of Higgs would in some way be related.
These bosoms, which we must emphasise here, are not all as exotic beasts as we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "messager" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric load accelerates or changes direction, this "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, a little like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "rangement" is a electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus, one of the "force carriers".
More stable field
The same goes with Higgs boson, in that difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disrupted" so that that boson appears.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you must reach very, very high energies, a little as if it was a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like that of the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circumference ring! - to reach such energies.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particles, nor all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself onto a refrigerator.
And in the same way, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while others (such as the photon, holds) do not have.
Now, what can "can bring" all these research, Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and this also allows physicists to investigate any differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
In addition, they are many to wish very much that they are found, because the least difference could open a door to a "new physics" and slaughter some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, providing no explanation for the gravity (oups!) or dark material, which forms about 80% of the material of the universe (re-oups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Impacts
The effects of this research in the daily of Mr. and Mrs. All-Le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no one.
Hold on, at the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers at the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They had scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - was originally seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and he earned the Nobel of Physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care - The best way to die...
With his Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly when a bill is being prepared.
However, in this essential area, much remains to be done.
The Devoir tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that sucked him had left him a two-year relapse.
"They had given me five years to live, I spent seven years," he said, half-figue mid-raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care house, from Bel eye, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilets, and even eating alone.
Attacked in front of a appetizing lunch, he accepts to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
He may even smile, talk to the strangers who are dealing around him, bring his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I be healed from diarrhoea, it is humiliating," he trusts.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In our life, we learn that a man is pissing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regression at the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person to accept the regression," he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments occur in the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer produces so-called curative care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and suffocated " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she said, "before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects, in the next few days, a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid are being lost.
These are palliative care, which you give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At death, oral care will be accepted to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer have to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We're helping your loved ones as much as your patients," says Nathalie Savard, Care Director.
At the house Victor-Gadbois, the days follow but do not look like each other.
Beside a 93-year-old old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, well placed in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old young man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying to survive everything.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancers under the age of 45," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to mitigate suffering when a patient has reached the final phase of his life, whether at home, at hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Home Palliative Care Society of Grand Montréal, are more or less exclusively specializing in cancer care.
It is precisely this great shortage in Quebec's health care that makes several specialist palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law setting out euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by summities of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to carry out euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients are asking to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
And, at the same time, several oncolleagues strangle their patients up to the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she abandoned an exaggerating chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologer that I stopped treatment, she said she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
But she told me I'm done!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of those who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having accessed their request after having been relied on by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Grand Montréal, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which is to sleep the patient until he died, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanasie me", that means "I want to be relieved".
This reportage was made possible through a journalism scholarship from Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scanning in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know of a great "system", mixing the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industrial " that cost Quebec taxpayers very expensive, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious as the system has been outdated since we've taken the great means," irons Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former Montreal police officer.
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011 through a substantive investigation into the malversations related to contracts for road works in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only agreed backwards.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasises, the only department of transport would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some refraining from their instincts to obtain a quote!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "discover the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the police of the "Marteau Scout" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "Sewer Card" to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and charges for fraud and corruption against elected municipalities, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb city.
The next one on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has been rehearsed in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers at the Montreal roadway and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary related to the mafia that returned the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito sowed all winds, giving over $88,000 in Canada (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, especially the liberals at the time of power.
He also acknowledged having organized an illegal fund collection for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts that he costed
In Montreal, the "corruption system" worked roundly.
Gilles Surprising, a former engineer in public works, made this very detailed before the commission: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and vintage pots totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts that he was costing.
Other road officials have confessed to being fattened by inflating bills from 30% to 40%, by false extras.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, drove Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal to draw the alarm ring.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rises in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate.
70% dirty money in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she says that she "draws on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by eggs, to stop the gangrene and sprinkle the guilts".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We are cleaning the wound, but we need a private Montreal investigation unit and a watch, not to see doubtful practices return.
Like we're cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on his side, notes that "public servants stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected people knowing the strategy", when they didn't drown in the groove!
Estimated at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironed: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to the parties to $100, but this will not change the fact that, according to him, "While no strictly limiting electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He urges a comprehensive revision of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go down; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story undermines the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who do not look at it in their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I progress with them.
Technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements drive me to lift my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in the foot.
But I'm not burning.
From my beginnings to the Clairefontaine INF preforming centre to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed on a scale.
So you benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this summer are used to fighting very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He's been squeezed by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's been side by side of big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I then came out of a series of wounds.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What look are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took us as a leader.
But we're still in a hurricane.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to go as far as we can.
Now everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say to very good European teams.
First of all, we want to finish the first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to receive the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GSP gives itself the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, wouldn't win the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really have the heart of putting this title as a champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media are waiting too much for PSG?
It's normal that we're expecting a lot of people in view of what has been invested and the players we've got.
We accept it completely.
After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame us, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We're wondering what people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is building with time.
We proved in the League of Champions that we could answer the presents.
Look at Manchester City who hasn't come to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, they have also made huge spending!
In view of the investments, you were imagined with 15 points in advance at the trêve!
It was neglecting our opponents and France's championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we finally win.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
So good as we say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and has a lot of goals.
He came for that, and he proves he's the star of League One.
He showed wherever he passed that he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This drives others to lift their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I had the heart of participating in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbed game time.
I saw things over there and I got out of it reinforced.
Today, I can make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we have to have an exemplary behaviour today.
What look are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Bleus?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the Qualifying Group for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires it to win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the bon null (1-1) dismantled, on October 16, in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never lived a match like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in BitTorrent's way, which allows the exchange of pair-to- pair files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around $10 (the courses are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the most success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or buying (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and treats trade.
With Bitcoin, all the network nodes are both depositors of the account book, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two electronic addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge for computers, and whose winner, as a temporary central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hacking phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add it a number before "hack" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction would then be indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different prints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted at each increase in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had highs and lows.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The failure used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-value payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, giant oils were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are less expensive.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users have.
There is a general move to question the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time to make Bitcoin fit, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In addition, the ECB's report provides for a reassessment of the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army resumes possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without waiting for anything from us.
It is especially the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign army presence, such as Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbekistan, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I have seen from the top of the hills planted by amandaries through French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armaments joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban defensive on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their control over the country had then been perceived as a sort of release, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of those peasants overrun by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mudjahidin, Afghan and current Taliban government join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main marks of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become affairists, invading government lands to sell them to returning refugees from Iran and Pakistan, with huge US subcontracts.
They disconceived, and most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, are looking for a government that is not a thief.
Many young people want to leave, as will go to those who have enjoyed the American broadness: the leakage of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kaboul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
Work must be provided to those young people who will no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are in the hands of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish sheets presenting a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militia, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, as the Western nations did, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, a strong presidential power, suppressing the Prime Minister's position since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But since the 1950s, and well before, his country has been dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in place, no important irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was spread that Afghanistan had enormous mining wealth.
This only added the feeling that the Westerns were only there to take it.
Without energy to treat the iron or copper ore on the ground, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) searching the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighter troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: school of girls, boys, department of French at university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural matters, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win the hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of simulating aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, has led, and has been completed by a small French NGO, many collective-interest work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, local workers, could help to contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable areas.
What will we remember after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often at more than 2,000 metres of altitude.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be free from the insurrection of foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish, there should be a small, well-controlled civil aid that directly affects them.
A Constitution at Forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the Constitutional Declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it decided to play its full.
Taking everyone short, he announced, on Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted two months to this House to complete its work.
It was almost two years ago that Egypt was based on a provisional text, several times amended, which weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the country's fracture.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic devotion", continuing to "trade his word" and "pied the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a way to end as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that requires the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the contestation is rageous throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he stated in an interview at the American hedging time.
In particular, the use of an urgent vote is the ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, with a large Islamic majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they had closed the door, assuming they were unable to express their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, replacement members, were added to the emergency yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators also enjoyed the fact that one of the only differences in the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was wrongly settled.
The text, which was still voting last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of charia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", answers the Liberals, who see only one call for communication.
For in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include section 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance with the laws with the charia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premices of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further reinforced by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"To date, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not orlemas but academics, for some trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic law, ndlr].
And in the future, the question could arise about the extent to which civilian judges are competent to take a decision on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticised because of the extensive powers it grants the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another controversial point is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will civil trials in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concern about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now banned, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, in particular the press.
In addition, no articles reflect women's protection, stresses Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to the Commission, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, events are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will show them on Saturday.
In Israel, sacred places, the Centre of the World and a sea of salt await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Earth brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has retained five major reasons for going to Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Make yourselves inevitable: the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptismal funds" will be affected by God's grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was transformed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he eased the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was in this particular place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you find the most sacred places, it's good in Jerusalem.
The believers travel there through the Rue de la Puffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoire), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Sépulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the place of the Stone of the Onction and the tomb.
Here is the Christian centre of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is built to the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Claims that constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people with different confessions leave there small words accompanied by prayers that are then heard.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the sudden rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only alpinism fans can go there by their own means.
For the others, one ferry takes them to this peak full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the Mont Hermont ski resort that hosts many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can drive you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have lived in the mountains.
Visit unique museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
Unable to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really deserve the detour.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very old manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: The Art Museum of Tel-Aviv.
The main features of the printers and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moulds of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built in memory of 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into a total darkness.
Shiny stars.
You will then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year round.
About this, this is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azur coloured water contains suction and holds bathers very easily, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are of superrealist beauty.
There is a treatment based on salted water, limon, curative sludge, and to treat various diseases such as dermatites, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply relax.
Discover the secrets of the Antiquity
They are preserved by the old town of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, here Noah built his arch and Persia saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to your sign, fate will smile to you.
In Jaffa you can meet young brides who came to take photo sessions of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk into the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the crosses.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in cheques (today $1 is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and high parts of the city.
This is almost a underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the working week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels only serve casher food, which excludes pigs, seafood, fish without squirrels and dishes made of both milk and meat.
There are plenty of lamb and beef-based dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also houmous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, whipped chicken peas, falafels, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats walking up the air.
We can see them sleep in the night on the roofs of the cars parked.
These felains love the past places and do not refuse to enjoy them.
Car rental varies depending on the brand of $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists travelled to Land Promised from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, to Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn language
While MEPs and human rights activists are polemical about what is going to be done in the mandatory language test law, fraudulents selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to carry out a Russian examination.
At present, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, but also knowledge of the history of Russia and the legal foundations, will need to be validated.
It will be necessary to validate its language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of the countries in which Russians have the official language status are exempt.
Persons who have obtained certificates or degrees of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this Act.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be run by the Russian-language Institute of Pouchkina, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to carry out examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already asked in the press many times the question: what will it be?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the Migration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers," explains Victor Sebelev, Director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
Problems arise for non-professional, non-trained migrants, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "trip" in a overcrowded house where he and tens of his fellows will be tortured for months without food and paper and will have to trick between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"Look at them, one thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they don't touch the planned salary," confirms the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Police!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to come to make money in Russia trust that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, it is not their fault, but their unfortunateness: few Turkmenians, Uzbekistan, Tajiks can afford to follow only a course of primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they arrive at the teenage, these young people are going to earn money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel less and less."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants who have a legal status.
Without a status, there will be no review or formal work in the future.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or Defense to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 rouble miles.
And then, you can get a fake record quickly for only 1,500 roubles.
Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have any record, which is why the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 roubles, for what to buy cigarettes, tea," said journalist Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajikistan citizen.
"Be quick, don't lessen and buy yourself a beautiful work of art."
From the first day of entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsed papers come out of an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who so hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand roubles for this document.
It is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand roubles.
The representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "papers".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first shot the time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve communicating actively with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they were shots during marriages or killings organized by the Moskovite lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
The police want to prohibit the use of rubber firearms in public places and increase the legal age of obtaining the firearm licence by increasing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "stoping the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this mad hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, declared to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a BBC criminal lawyer and expert.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police service over a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is available through several channels.
The main channels are five," says Victor Baranets, retired Colonel who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking arms commands
The first is the "military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from the law enforcement forces.
Baranets explains that these are both the weapons stolen in police stocks and those stolen directly from the representatives of the law enforcement forces.
Illegal guns go for sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been exposed to explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been triggered intentionally to hide the deficit," explains the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"Private arms plants are seen that do not compete with competition in the international market and flow weapons in the black market, especially in Moscow," explains an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local, sometimes craftsman production, a mafia has formed and organized supply," adds the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explains the researchers, come from the army and the law enforcement forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market were found "on account of the employees whose work is related to weapons," explains the report.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons came from military conflict sites, 14% were stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% came from "smuggled bulbs".
A vendor and consultant from a arms industry who requested to keep anonymous ensures that for a long time no one has bought weapons found by these illegal search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, the sellers are going to pick up the new goods in military warehouses.
The person purchases a unit through an instructor, e.g. a TT gun.
We're delivering it to him by passing the merchandise through a grill.
"He transportes it to town and sells it for 900 € by unit with two loaders," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be investigated, they are buying control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"As in a luxurious shop"
The seller and buyer are usually using knowledge.
I visited websites, blogs, until a guy manifests and proposes to come to the station of Begovaya where someone had to take me to a "coin" to buy.
The price of the gun, I was given it on the spot
Victor Baranets and military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you also have to come there by saying, for example, "from such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American pins with the help of a person I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give it.
Small new people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
In his view, the diagrams have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "all we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," remembers the military.
There's no secret to the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I'm not just buying, we go with the forest seller and we install a target.
"They let me shoot, and when I am convinced that the gun works well, they start negotiating," the expert explains.
A store from his couch
Search engines show the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any document and no one to meet.
"Just have a precise amount of money," we write in advertising on the "Buy a gun or a fighter gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Without permissible, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (order retained).
"Achète TT. Moscow", wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of counterfeit sites and collects people who want to buy combat weapons.

I have heard about this type of scheme: generally, the site is recorded outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the orders.
The buyer shall make the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making an application on the site, we can find ourselves without a gun and behind the bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, according to experts, may cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the "Right to a gun", we can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the department's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia declined by 7% and reached 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: fast food and supermarket employees are in strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages of the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow wide or breathe quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
At the same time as the increase in low wages for basic employees in Walmart and in fast-restaurants, the event organizers wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Vendredi", when a depressing rain of balances caught millions of inhabitants smashed on America and sometimes triggered splashes.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart company, who are employed in the world 2.2 million people, left their position to organize strike picquets with the trade unions and left activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: from layers to hunting guns through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid employees at Walmart do their shopping only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the criticisms, Walmart can be able to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifting cars or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Black Vendredi" events called for a wage increase, and complained that the company's medical insurance price had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who touches $9.5 per hour, it is a sum that he cannot afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, that would cost the group $ 3.2 billion.
That's 1.1% more than it's currently spending.
If Walmart transfers all the increase in wages to consumers' shoulders, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12,39 more in one year than now.
The supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests had taken place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Black Vendredi" continued in stores from 8:00 a.m. to midnight the following day and Walmart sold 5000 items at the second.
His funds have carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Venice".
In an interview at the left-hand Huffington Post, the spokesperson of Dan Fogleman assured that Walmart's employees had left their positions "less than five" and that the protest was only a "com' operation among many others" by the organisational union.
"Next Client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and did not concern the Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, that is why they are not yet located there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you've done honestly!
Jumane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage provided by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases them over time, but on average her basic employees reach $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me, it's inconceivable to live with that sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school while living at their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live with that salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum we find comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue required fast food cashers and cookers to be paid at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also requested the creation of trade unions in the fast-restauration sector.
The U.S. law prohibits administration from hindering and punishing the protesters of a trade union by brimades or redundancies.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held close to several other fast restoration chains.
The lighthouse of the protest was the midday gathering near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and do not pay you the work you did honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, particularly by the candidate for the position of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we all need to support employees in the fast restoration so that they obtain a fair wage and economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast-restauration sector throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people have participated without counting that not all were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to say whether this sparkling mass movement will make small.
"For the moment, we can only betray the brain averagely."
Recently, fans of new technologies have used to perceive the increased reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google revealed its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, the interview with the director of the 3D interactive technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, shows that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the moment remained at pixels on flat screen and sometimes at touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
- What is the future also for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered physical interaction, many things are happening on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, is not really.
We are trying to change this and working on real 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to make the computer world out in our physical world, make it more touchable.
For this, however, we must identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start with, let's get rid of those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She is appreciated, but is she not overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others about their actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its nest.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand worn bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but theoretically it is possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: geste + voice.
- Is that what I'm saying?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You would do it with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or does not do at a given time?
- Not mandatory, but this is mutual approximation.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors for example, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, we are based on the present generation in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are pretty good, which adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution according to the X and Y axes must be kept in mind, but also Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames at second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, has given the touch of sensors a regular delay in treatment between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more managers at the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect today has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the other is a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the camera curve, and to see how this could help to define locations.
- As much as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone the hands lifted is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass from glasses to smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes their strength (personal elements are the ones you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses does not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no touching feeling!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of touchless feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is using the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to assign palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that influence the nerve ends of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him believe he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is another task below which we will have to do for a long time: how to believe someone who is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of racing carpets (not to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only averagely mislead the brain, and many years of work remain.
That is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertility.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgeois Front Guard" dedicated to the cities in advance, at the front guard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors of the St. Petersburg artistic scene whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverti painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather barbered, all red dressed that can be found near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the branched festivals and lanterns.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather the crowds, regardless of where they are exhibited.
He is one of the petersbourgeois contemptors of landly social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg front guard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and put them in a good mood.
He recently took into his hands an organ of Barbaria and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, philosophy and image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking the city in red and not in yellow or Turkish blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painter, imagemaker and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Cultural Palace where my work was located.
I figured that was my way.
So the wave of the old non-official painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were ignored.
I began to join friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find me in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took my seat in Pouchkinskaya-10, which had a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian Bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I see Chnour coming with the project "Van Gogh's ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in moulding suits, and among them were Igor Vdovin, composer in fashion today.
When the group started to live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg had a lot of shows before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education was at our home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are the effects of the artistic clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Peintre de l'année", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have very strong news and accuracy.
I'm going to have an exhibition programmed "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scared to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes out, the tragic falls.
I like bigsque, I have bigsque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through complete and mandatory dressing.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but we need to scratch him on the trunk.
And the lie will be wiped out by dressing.
Recently we saw you in the role of Barbaria's organ player.
Who else than I can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be cured, delicate, liqueurous.
There is a disintegration of culture.
Before, people were divided into flocks, the supporters of the bohemus loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw out to see, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people come, 10 miles don't come, and in the end, it's less management, money, everything's gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to betray them, not to ruin the lives.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hanged next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it doesn't have anything to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that the right experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who may be experts, but they are dismissed, because there are higher experts who will properly assess these experts and go through a path.
Currently, it is the "smake reign" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say they don't take all contemporary art, that there are painters who need to find themselves other museums.
- For you, what is this St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At our house, this layer is very fine.
We have to turn art into fashion as it was in the beginning of last century.
Project implemented with the support of the St. Petersburg Fellowship
Birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board go to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how to continue to make our species live in an abomination or on a relief planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, assuming.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the State astronomic Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitudes or on the Orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
There was another half-century of experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas cultivated on orbit did not differ in any way from the land varieties.
Then we put on the orbit of insects, small breeding drosophile flies.
In 1979, cold eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed as a sword.
We get a very normal chicken on the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chicken must find support, it must get on his feet and start moving," explains the Director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medicinal and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were disordered.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophic.
The chicks did not react to either light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after fourteen days.
"We have carved their eyes twice, then we abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev by finding the failure of experience with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite " Bion " will be on board only species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their foetus into space.
In principle, we didn't find anything supernatural.
"These were still biosatellites, and then it is the only experience. It is necessary to carry out such research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their birth.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a small deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man can do so, in principle.
The Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
This kind of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has more value.
Our mould flew out and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice on orbit and even working in a non-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy descendant after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this is a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
Laboratorium d'hydrologie du Centre de préparation des cosmonautes: obligatory stage of the preparation for flight.
Here, in zero floatability, the cosmonauts train to extra-vehicular exits.
The water imitates the slander.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves for about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
This is basically logical, because from his birth to his first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just born the amazant is a more natural condition, the woman needs gravity, weight force.
As the abdomen muscles, the basin muscles are atrophic very quickly, the baby's pushing capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will be able to bring it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite us to consider this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a fully unsuitable disabled child," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medico-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still the theory.
However, with time, this will become reality, when the Territorials will travel into their shuttles to a remote planet that will become the habitat of their descendants born in space.
The Head of the ISC (Higher Institute of Public Finance Control) said: "The control of the pseudo self-employed (in Czech " system Švarc ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is behind its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Higher Financial Control Institution, said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is missing in our homes," Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
As an example of abuse, he quotes Petr Nečas' approach to the Švarc system.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls; is it permissible or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in some way, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority to inspect the law," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the House of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the legislation on public procurement in these two countries was compared.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as its practice.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more stringent and of better quality", but, according to some parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continually develop more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely, and what results for you?
Common control of this type should just help us stop trying to clarify the laws, lower them and improve the thresholds, when they do not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is so submerged by paperwork that those looking for the shortcomings will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems related to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different method of organization?
With regard to institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organised similarly, it also has a council formed a little differently, but these two institutions proceed basically similarly.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the various Länder.
BRH can only control federal money, which is in our homes with government resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities at our home are controlled in the course of the Länder' accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in some areas Germany is often designated as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider as a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage of cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has meant for you as an institution, the amendment to the Public Procurement Act, are its effects already felt?
Since this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has no impact on our control operations yet.
As we do retrospective checks, we must count with some delay.
Our comments relate only, for the moment, to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detecting the risks of malmanagement" with which we have gone to the gap of almost 14 000 public contracts - which will of course be felt, because the thresholds and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on have been changed.
So do you consider the adoption of this Act rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the subjects controlled to accept that any breach of the Market Act meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system, but not punish those who commit formal errors without any effect on the decision-making process.
Such a system will bring more pressure on administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He may say, "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be fulfilled, rightly to protect the bidding.
However, it is tragic that a bidder should be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is missing in our homes.
The roads are frozen by places, but most of them remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely operational, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillated between -5 °C and -10 °C, but they are expected to rise slightly in the day.
Snowfalls have stopped in the region and there is only a fine layer of snow in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metallic Mounts (Krušné hory) are covered with approximately 30 centimeters of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service show that due to the fog, visibility was reduced by location.
The rapid R6 route and national roads in the region are now easy to operate.
However, vigilance remains to be put, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and glide.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
It remains on some of their sections of frozen snow residues and by places filled with traffic.
Especially in areas in altitude, drivers must increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohemian roads are threatened by the formation of verglass and that traffic-tapped snow layers can be found on the roads in mountainous and altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of glass formation in the areas of the Pardubice region in altitude.
There may be glasses in the surroundings of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly located in the Mounts of Géants (Krkonoše) and the Mounts of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knńnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow is present on the roads in areas at the altitude.
In East Bohemia, time will be dry today, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally shine between -3°C and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are today practical, although there is a need for increased vigilance and adapting their conduct to weather conditions.
Morning temperatures will be freezing, and they will rise from -3 °C to -9 °C.
After the latest snowfall and cooling that followed, some communication channels may be frozen by places.
Drivers may expect to cross fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practical almost without difficulty, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in Pilsen-South district and in Tachov district.
The departmental and third category paths are wet and, in this case, the warning against frozen sections is applied.
Drivers must be watchful, especially on less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers traveling to the areas of the region of Olomouc in altitude today must count with a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the col said "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kʹ, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced the road maintenance staff to go on the ground this night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the ground floors are practical without any difficulty.
"On the heights of the district of Šumperk there are snow residues.
Drivers moving towards Jeseník must expect to meet at the "Červenohorské sedlo" colloquium a layer of thick and soft snow," said today to ČTK the head of the road maintenance services in the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník District also visited the site during the night; according to the latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district roads are easy to use, but in the Šternberk district drivers should pay attention to areas in forest areas on the wet ground.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, North Bohemian Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult sections.
The police's data show that, in addition to some places covered with snow or glass, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, so snow and glass should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of glasses, in particular around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and rain during the day, open sky and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions are also reported on the national road 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow to reach the ground.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and we think that we are the only group capable of collecting a positive surplus of energy in order to reverse or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you will show up a unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more in detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m. 10 a.m.
On 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time when the Maya calendar will end on the island of Kiribati, which is in the peaceful ocean, on a 12-hour time zone in advance of us.
Who got that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, and then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to think about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymn against the end of the world, which is entitled " The End of the World Cancelled " (in Czech Konec světa zrušeno).
She is already very popular on YouTube, will it be heard at these charitable concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen ...
She will be singed simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The hymns will also join at a given time in the context of a unique, live broadcast of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tom★ Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We work with other personalities of the Czech show biz, because we organize many charitable concerts and events...
We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It has proved that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it enjoys them.
What will be the benefit of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with Tap Association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that are interesting and fun.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will come up on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that is addressed to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will climb on stage Chinaski, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji★ Suchý.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Spring of Prague; there too, we will probably prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalistic, so far you have played, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks at first.
We have five electric chair members whose gears must travel in saddle, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has been more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything happened without any problems.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public opinion attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we were just witnesses in Moscow than in the east is only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there it is not common yet that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet see it as an obvious thing to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there is also an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are still dependent on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a heavy disability move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, in this respect, you, The Tap Tap, are rather the tip of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years ago, what led you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And as I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, with the time, as our moderator La Angelovič says, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I don't get wrong?
It is true that creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it was not in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also allow us to have professors of quality, equipment and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In some ways, it's logical: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts long.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is natural compassion, it is natural ...
But compassion is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take in compassion.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, provided that they have the necessary resources of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities can achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works in the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, L.A. Angelovič.
We're an open group, people enter and leave, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the day before the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 2 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of The Tap Tap Group "Fin of the World Cancelled " will be sang together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale of tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted to be the twentieth member of the Agency, it was the second Member State of the former Eastern Block (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in a number of the Agency's projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical Observatory in Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his predecessor's work entitled "Introduction to Astronautry " .
The development of this young engineer (born 1905) left cold listeners, and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his work "Introduction to the Astronautic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major propagator of astronomy and astronautry.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of world-famous astronautics, and his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As of 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket should be used to drive or brake the drain.
The only information known about this draisin is those of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
Research was carried out by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The documents retained show that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research has stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by a writer called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were designed to use rocket engines in the military.
Just before the war, all rocket technology projects were conducted by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautic society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the Journal Problem, in which are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronaut Federation (created in 1951) and from the fall the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He retained his position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre rocket was 80 cm long and weighed slightly less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was built, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and have been used to observe wind in altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, followed the first RM-type rockets.
The rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed and distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum reach of all these types of gear was 37 km.
During the period 1965-68, Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland to the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should also be mentioned.
In the context of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Use Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Use Works Act.
This decision raised a deep discussion in the public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to consider this issue from a broader point of view.
The economic systems that are geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means, in concrete terms, that the various economic entities and national economic systems are constantly conflicting with each other.
This is a result of the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital linked to a frightened financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour price (wages) create a price tension.
In this sense, a producer seeks by imports of low-value goods to resist economic competition by " making" the competitor's price more expensive in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
To a large extent, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy at low prices or disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital is not responsible from a social point of view and therefore is responsible for the unemployment caused by it, the social burdens of the State must be increased.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect bad will of men and women entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so publicly known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
In the various economies, unscrupulous private capital practices create a situation in which governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own population at the expense of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically compel its own population to accept the dictate of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, through a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between rich and poor.
In RFA, for years, there have been public food distribution points for poor people that cannot live up to their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive salaries such that the state is forced to pay a supplement to achieve the minimum vital.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU Member States create, undoubtedly, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was in the 19th century) or to live with wages of poverty, at the margin of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here we have to ask ourselves the question: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim, to be tired of it, that the State cannot invest in capital in its own economy, that the leading economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then questionable whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not lead, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same way, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powered and present lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate bills to industrially-related lawyers.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
The whole power is not from the people, as the Western constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in Caesar's and Pompes' times": "The state has been in the middle of delicacy for a long time and the functions were attributed by violence.
Wine pots, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption were proliferating without limits and the people went to elections with already sold voices" ... ... "The honest people were not trying to get any functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls."... 'We really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was a self-craty and that one had to choose a powerful man"... It is true that Apple had in the spirit of Pompee, but Caesar has irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolute regime.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without respect for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and promote the interests of society as a whole.
This results, as it was in the past, in decade without precedent of elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of the fascist and communist regimes in the free liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems can be considered to be a kind of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elite ignores completely the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human lives losses, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know about them in ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Use Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and intra-European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This is a systemic trend.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen State capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the abstinence is "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would not be wars," said Gutle Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her death bed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have emerged.
Some take Israel's party, arguing of its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim in its waves of repeated killings; as a whole, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a view "behind the curtain" on the one that mainly benefits from tensions that have lasted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available in the study, others come from my own understanding of that, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexandrian the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they had to act in the throne to someone who directed their actions according to predetermined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been possible over a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family is particularly distinguished, which could be considered the head of the bait (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Few are written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s, they acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) to put an end to linking their names to serious criminal acts that they were involved in and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or conducting wars against countries in which they do not yet have such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7 after the invasion of Iraq 5 after the invasion of Kaddafi only 4 in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status to the Rothschild Bank of America and began to issue his own money (government, I hear it) during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to initiate a trial against the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst of power at the world level led in the 1859 to 1871s to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, an initiated mason at 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The goal of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (a such amount of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF aimed at avoiding recurrence of crises such as those caused in 1907).
After having succeeded in triggering the first world war through the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg at the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly by a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the morcellation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the Second World War, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they have imposed far-reaching war repairs to Germany generating the conditions of radicalization of the poor masses (then they have enough to place a sufficiently powerful leader, showing the finger of the guilty, offering simple solutions) and on the other hand they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority, who had to play the role of the fifth column to put the fire in powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which sought the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the historical Judea region with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above lay the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler had broken the chains in which international bankers had held it at first; or if everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war repairs imposed on Germany were the cause of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel started a fire foyer that could cause a third World War.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the battles, this time as will the Arab or generally Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like an enormous laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in that country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are divided utterly among Israel's supporters and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a damage causes another harm according to an endless circle of violence and where we find, in the origins of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power throughout the world?
Here we need to make a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as at our home, international bankers only offer people their own candidates for elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascinating politicians, loyal to international bankers, who do everything they can to trigger a war with Iran, which, due to its accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), could expand to become a global conflict and, given Iran's control of the Ormuz narrowness through which 20% of all the global oil (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) passes through and results in the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all newborns are found to implant at birth an electronic chip making it a fully controlled being.
"Let them force all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear a mark with red iron on the hand or front, so that he can neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that whoever has good sense is counting the numbers of this fierce beast.
This number denotes man and it is six hundred sixty six."
The film Argo: When everything goes bad, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamic students attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and hostaged 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer a positive outcome to the U.S. administration, it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have severely undermined the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, a blow further worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestrated diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their fate in the United States caused a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranian feeling.
The Iranian debase greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential elections against Ronald Reagan.
The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated outbreaks, they met in the ambassador of Canada's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA succeeded in bringing them out of Iran through a crawling cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team coming to make traces for the shooting of a great science-fiction film.
Combination of genders
The exfiltration expert's plan Tony Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialist stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictive production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, since the film was based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several kinds.
This is part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper film", the story of a successful shot, of a tragedy - such as, for example, in Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The ambiances follow: sequences of Teheran in documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the era of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been rewritten in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes of the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck succeeded in relaunching his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculized actor, he became a respected performer, and his play of actor ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long film after the dark police " Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The city" (2010).
It is also the first film of Affleck that doesn't take place in its original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Teheran's role is "maintained" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, when real facts are rebuilt; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his employees have a similar effect in the fictive scenes (the false painting team in Teheran's basar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director must have been content with a subject offering in fact few palpitating scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It goes very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality, and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Teheran Airport is removed by a phone call in America and the continuation on the landing track is sufficiently drawn by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its discarded character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have earned a larger place and they are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it shows itself with moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and retro style of the 1970s.
He leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of another story, in a certain way, unfinished so far, and as an illustration of the excessive nature of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the case.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently planned to adopt a 40-percent women's quota for the management of major European businesses has been the source of our decision," said Právo, the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women have been preceded in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for insurance companies.
People can report any other incredible idea of "the EU workshop" until the end of the year.
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,"nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add biocomponents to fuels, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
In the past, criticisms have also been expressed against the fact that the term "butter to pier" or the withdrawal of the sale of classical bulbs are not used.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (such as the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, due to the fact that bananas in the Union must not be of a size of less than 14 cm or have an abnormal current.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonised non-harmonizing national standards that complicated trade.
The fruit and vegetable standards have been softened despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to waste of food.
The first prize can be awarded in this survey to the EU regulation of last year that must include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult monitoring.
The EU referred to an American survey that balloons are among the toys the first cause of death of children by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 in terms of blowing in fair trumpets.
We also have strange ideas at our home.
The following rule concerning European officials itself is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedoine" and must instead speak of FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Association "Let Faire" associating liberal economists, Bankovnípoplatky.com server has in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, appointed the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for preserved mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this investigation found the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea is a problem for us.
We will ask the European Union for a refund."In autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) expressed this.
He argued that, due to our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were, in concrete terms, to be used to prepare grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Smart regulations are rare."
While regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development deserve rather praise.
More serious, for example, is, according to experts, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (she is not always a winner) raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
If, at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar.ky", for what the name "Tuzemský rum" comes from our homes in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not sugar based on beet sugar, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, we find today together with globally known cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's toast or Parme ham, Karlovy Vary's ("Karlovarské suchary") biscuits, Pohořelice's and Třebo's ("Pohořelický a Třebořský kapr") carpes and Žatec's (Žatecký chmel) hops.
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Hořice Cornets" ("hořické trubičky") may also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Mr. senator, how is the idea of taking part in the presidential elections?
It's not to be a senator or president who counts on me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been plundered over the past twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I had no ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to get a solution to change.
And since I'm over forty years old and I'm independent, a member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate, but you started quickly for the Castle (N.d.T.: Chair's seat).
Isn't that how you turn your back to those who chose you?
I've always said that I'll go to the battle for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections
Subsequently, I explained that if I was elected Senator, I would be presenting myself in the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is just an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we go to the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we cough those who try to make change.
In addition, the press breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
We have, for example, stated that I am suing journalists or that I was the adviser of Ji. paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have begun the battle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To this end, you must change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I made pressure to ensure that tourist guide activities were a liberal profession, I gained a gain of cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is consciously refused and delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have much more chances of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and supportive dogma, to take from every party what is best for our country and to implement it.
Do you consider yourself a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're going ahead.
What matters to me is not whether people are on the left or on the right, but to gather people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you mad when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without Parliament's support, there are only slogans left for you.
You won't survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to bring them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected President, it would not be a problem to retransmit to television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want to do so.
When there is a strong personality to identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president in direct vote, it was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without abomination, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to make things progress, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years, and I'll go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't make the difference, that's why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also attend Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported the investigative reporter Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud to the oil.
I presented myself because people are really discontented, but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote and most of them gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People chose a Senate that could hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, the direct election of the mayors and prefets of the regions.
Are you planning to establish your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have a 25 million property in Prague, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of art works worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million in my account.
Or by the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was gay with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You're rolling in Aston Martin, you've got a worth of 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic, but don't you want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I owe me a debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor clearly shows that my program does not raise great interest.
I'm not obliged to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live, for example, pay the English school of my son who costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I will not present myself to any election.
So you're going to continue your business activities to live?
Didn't you say that you would put your activities in a doom?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the direction of the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a entrepreneur?
I earned and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the Práva newspaper.
The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that the real adventures are not just an imagination business. To convince themselves, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly built book mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it is very futurist, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passing on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, an informatic in a large neighbouring company, says to us, "Yes, he's really beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes to one of these silly libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a town-dortoir that has nothing attractive at the doors of Rotterdam, has a quite special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest educational rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to general culture and reproduce the seven fictive bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures of painted armed concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
Thus, the city authorities realized that there was only one way to take over the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam's MVRDV Architects Office, master of the bold and cynical steep charts, accepted the project with his usual flegma and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a bribery on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at themselves, disconcerted and lifting the shoulders, Maas, the face-to-faced, emptied his choice books in order of size to make it a pyramid, and finished his speech supported by activist arguments by one: "common dear!"
Here's my proposal for the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, or, as we say, the Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros shed land.
The building is part of a revitalization project with also underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the book mountain received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small, terne town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a mayor of an abominable cowardice, whose white facades invite to think of a dairy house, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to read
First impression: Eldorado from the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator brings you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you crowd the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The fully glass-made interior is bright and bright, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverbs speak unambiguously the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and little boys and girls who play balls.
And all over books, books, and even books.
"Normally, libraries are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and unpersonal," says Willy Maas.
We completely altered the classic space configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been well equipped: in the middle are offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and the technical centre of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are often lambris, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircases.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the endurcise building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in an answer to the Standard.
This is how we one day found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural farm.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes of one millimeter thickness have been used as substrates in greenhouses and fields for years.
It's cheap and we're getting time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw it.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose odour both refers to a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 walks is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, the literary café offers an amazing view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
These create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the new soul
"This is incredible, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model ecology project," says Troubrest.
The temperature of the building is set by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun lits little time in the interior, even in the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass façade serve as a sunset, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated stores are handled from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computerist mentioned above, has already been at risk of entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
Cynthia Bogarde, Professor of Chinese Traditional Medicine, even describes Buchenberg as "the soul finally found" in Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped fill the blankets of the library that were not yet completely garnished (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master's discipline called in the professional jargon "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if she may seem young and poorly educated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a sensitive political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request by the Palestinians to obtain observer status from the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical to Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union makes the situation more difficult.
The Germans thus hit several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still struggling to find this role, but are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" of foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It demonstrates the willingness to adopt independent positions from those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national cases.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers, which is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position with regard to the Middle East conflict and the abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to strike public opinion, but also the elite of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a crucial element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because this is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a crucial element in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany abide by its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration secretly demonstrates a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences in opinions are not so large that they always seem to be.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will note that Obama is far from enthusiastic about Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany have difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other hand?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore register within a wider policy line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are currently doing in the issue of the euro.
In my view, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and will force Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that marks more their independence.
Does Germany have a role to play as a major player on the international stage, but does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does it still have difficulties in taking up leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
Looking, for example, at the euro crisis, it is noted that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more sensitive position than the United States.
It must work with very diverse neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the US's influence on European policy is only decreasing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, so what is left?
Germans simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially filed in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark is thus protected by such protection that the company which bears its name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it's not sure that she'd gain cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of Taylor Wessing's firm specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
The imitators need only a few additional letters to register their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we recorded Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we recorded Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copied in full legality, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports products.
Pattloch opens a classer in which records are made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by owning part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multiple-storey commercial centres that sell almost only counterfeiting.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his clients charge him to deal with the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
That is the term that women who marry rich men are called.
The Chinese authorities say there's nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
Financial losses and costs of justice are millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive light products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of €15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the world market that develops the fastest.
However, it is not easy to remove doubtful registrations from the trade mark register and these procedures are expensive.
These may last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported on the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the criticized name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant has no chance, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiar, because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought back the producer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquirer, used before a blue and white logo that reminded BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiars in Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits to have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and space.
However, the Office would have passed last year from an emergency situation in the course of work to a normal one.
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the Office.
Cost of action
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and that means that China is at the top of the ranking for the tenth consecutive time for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has fought a Chinese plague.
Certainly, the Germans were able to obtain a suspension of the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"This is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichians.
Freudenberg has obtained gain of cause in the following two instances, but the adverse party continues to fight until today.
The vigilance is of
Today, the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and deplores the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, difficult and cost us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. Archive service has even had to review the acts of the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the adverse party a "six-digit euro sum" to resolve the dispute.
"This is what we see what this represents for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to move to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of non-protected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had for a long time abandoned this sector, but it could still have prevented deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is a bet."
Pattloch and him advise German companies to be careful in their trade relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trade mark law, rather, foreigners should "registre everything that is likely to be protected in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Singing, Help
The Imbongi choir repeated in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the AIDS of Swaziland are pleased with their arrival.
This is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First of all, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketballs, ladies' scarpins and men's mocassins are looking for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers are slowly increasing - alto, low, tenor and soprano - they take, envout and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestral leader almost loses his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 came from genetician in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorus has different words, all in a very exotic language: salty, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 orphans of AIDS in the village of Estjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means in zoulou "container of stories" or even "attraction of praises".
No one can usually speak the banton language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany to now return it to her native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, Esitjeni is the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or soil huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, the worst causes for Swaziland are the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population virtually never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population bears the immunodeficiencies virus and it is not rare to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Imbongis especially saw many children on the street that lacked parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is no perspective.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed themselves to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a warm meal every day.
But just one year later, the choral founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then handles almost professionally the AIDS orphans of Estjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among bacterial ISTs are syphilis, chlamydies and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papillom virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pubs and the gale belong to the parasitic IST.
What groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhagia often occur in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute considers that sexual contact between men is the source of at least four cases of syphilis out of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydiaea, trichomonase, candidiasis (fongic), blennorrhagia and human papillom virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The HIV spread rate among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has increased more than doubled in 10 years: from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.688 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a tenth reduction compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abcess in the genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, lower ventricular pain, as well as the appearance of buttons and wrists.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to Protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often switches from sex partners should conduct regular examinations.
Most rapidly recovered ISTs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds that chorus collect through their voices throughout Germany, the resources accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well accommodated, for example, with one of their grandmothers.
Gogos are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day at the hour in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cookers who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the support of the American PSI Health Organization, the association organized a HIV screening test for many inhabitants.
This is not the case, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "for it is a subject that affects sexuality."
It's rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These practices sanctioned by the State, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, there are condoms at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchanges, the Imbongi choirs travel together every two or three years to South Africa and excite songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people on the top of the black continent still know of the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition that it not only produces good mood and joy, but sometimes also cuts a tear to some terrible border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where choirists visit their daughters.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," says the people there.
And after a 8.773 kilometers of bird flight, returning to Heidelberg, in front of those choruses who take foot in the Bergheimer Straße rehearsal, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercure
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the Mercure planet.
The ice layer could reach 20 metres of thickness.
The US Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the Mercure planet.
Although this planet is nearest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published on Thursday in the specialised magazine "Science".
Messenger's probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the planet's region constantly dive into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have hit Mercure.
However, there is no link between water discovery and the assumption of a life presence on the planet," explains the chief scientist of the Messenger Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
Discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the nay planet Ceres.
As Pluton, which is orbiting around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink points, more difficult to identify, are the "new-borns" in the universe's birthroom.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars were born, called "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopea, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flaming shine of a star dying.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense nebulous Trifide, at 5,400 light-years of the Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birth room.
The Pleiades, also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope gives more value to colours.
On this infrared photo, the Nebula of Helice, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located at 700 light-years in the constellation of the Verseau.
His resemblances with a continent on earth have given him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular color.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope could capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigma of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remnants of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any traces.
One of the biggest and clearest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the color, photographs of the spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the Southern European Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the Constellation of the Sagittarium, several thousands of light years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trays divide the glowing heart from the place of birth of the stars.
The astronomers have photographed the premices of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies hurry to one, the collision is inevitable.
Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its surname as "Australic Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Cephea.
The nebulous is 1.400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
There is the circle of black holes that is 430 million light years on Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
The scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebulous is the youngest group of stars in our milky way.
The heavenly beard always gives birth to new stars.
These stars clouds, which are connected by the Nebula of the Rosette, also continuously create young stars at 5,000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with light and permeated rays of a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Mount Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its speciality depends on its high light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Aribo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Any person owner of a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search of extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the calculation power of its machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés by 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaii volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest.
They had two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and its mirror diameter will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has delivered us images of the remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are inhabitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb space telescope (JWST) will be sent to space early in 2018 on board a Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will be designed to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
The scientists believe that the Southern Pole of Mercure also houses ice.
However, there are no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits far closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
For decades, radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercure.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach worthy ages of the Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country, in which we are still relatively young at the age of 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach worthy ages of the Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country, in which we are still relatively young at the age of 97.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is of a spoiled romanticism.
By the way of the many road turns, the small bus cahotes along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we'd almost be in the North Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group is living in the name of Talysh, on which we do not know much, if it is only that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerian and they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town is plasting with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not at all agree with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is far too difficult.
It takes eight hours to walk the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist resort.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of this kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozens of Talysh in the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white picture.
This is my grandfather, who reached the age of 120.
To still have a child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth act.
And when one thinks that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have designed a girl.
Would Irali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man at the age of Central Asia.
"Awful elderly people also live in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinia there are men who live incrediblely old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, without counting that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the southern part of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerian tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh calories-rich meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a drink of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical of seeing it throughout the Caucasus region.
It sits on the floor next to a bark, whose content it hits irrevocably.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two little children also smash in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his shovel hide from the long steep of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
For my whole life, I never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the nation's paternal figure, a man who has yet ruled his country as a dictator, does not almost know any limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham later succeeded him.
However, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount as in euro) monthly for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long graying son has been right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" ignored in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Competitive demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on charia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words full of emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility for the people and for God," he said at State television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for Christian Copts, Liberals, Enlightened Muslims and Lay.
For all members of the opposition, confused and desperately unified, are afraid.
They are afraid of theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apology, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his "to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate at the American University of South California, wants to save.
Will the judicial authority be reversed?
The 234 articles written in the hurry by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 persons during a 15-hour night force tower are indeed to some extent worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and it remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the legal margin resulting from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the charia.
In any case, it seems to me that an article recently introduced stipulates that, with regard to all the subjects of charia, the Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its shrinking radiates on all Sunni Islamic worlds.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto lead to the supervision of the judiciary.
Many aspects of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts worked to repress opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, can be read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids to offend or defame the prophet Mahomet or his sent.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Just as doubtful is the wording that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the President or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in the draft that Mr Morsi puts to the vote and which, according to his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution was coming back"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concordance on the Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the charia before it entered into force.
"The revolution will be reborn and we will win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, who arrived at the third presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the wastes of history".
On Twitter, the instant messenger service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we go to his palace and we will turn him down," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expelled," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its invalidity.
"The Coran is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on the Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other shore of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
Sailed women and salafists, who have participated in a large number, scanned: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Netto our country!", they asked Morsi, saying that "the Coran was their constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir place, where everything began, would soon have resulted in a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that was what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as their supporters, had expressed their strong voice.
According to them, it is now time for the people to decide by the urns of the direction that the country must take.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
Human rights are not mentioned once
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry against this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts in Moubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was shot, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World on Sunday.
The extension of Morsi's powers to three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are a crying violation of the rules of democracy and will result in a new dictatorship in Egypt.
" Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto removes all his powers," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay.
A protester on the Tharir Square warns: "You are born of a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rockfish: is it the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely odorous fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of the rakfisk, one of Norway's most prestigious spots.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odour, omnipresent, impresses the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt shrub and fermented in the water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat crude, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local fireman who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people are adorning small pieces of fish and a lot of drinks.
"Some people prefer aquavit rather than rakfisk," Havard adds.
Drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid making it go under your nose, it's not bad - that reminds me of a sushi that would have passed long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the cooling, the fish was immersed in airproof water barriques, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, when well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses of the alcohol - was eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrants to the United States.
Now the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, although smelling element, of the past of Norway.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not for it to be deplorable.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the sole reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, to the blonde hair and in the eyes of a transpersible blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a handful of rockfisk.
We are - how do you say - careful people.
His English, like that of most people living here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to point out.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money through the windows, over the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the ropes of its stock exchange tight.
"While we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," Anna explains.
"Without forgetting the rockfish," she adds in an insure laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm making the queue to buy me something to eat - I had my dose of rockfisk.
In the menu, a hamburger made up of elan, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where you can use rockfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a node, surrounded by rockfisk plates.
We would be like the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, from the BBC, is interested in the difficulties and expectations of the people who are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where the traffics are legionate in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scratch to become the new president in the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
The Mexico economy is doing well, the results we owe to the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is prone to a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Pena Nieto was the governor of the state of Mexico before he fled the American president.
A very populated and tentacular state that entangles the capital. On its land of predilection, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is recorded in the memory of all.
The locals allocate the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To get to the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bowled and full of crabs.
His name-bowing plates are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We rely on him for sustainable change," said his friend and political allier Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of powerlessness, the PRI was evaded in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of the opponents who accuse the new President of lack of charism.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent state man and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the motorway cars, it is, in many respects, a suburb of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, soldiers were called for rescue to combat drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a damaged area, tens of women killed in the last two years have been found in a discharge border.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's distractors say that, at the best, he has failed to overcome the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
In the worst case, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in front of him.
In a concrete house, typical of this delabated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to keep her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed that her body had been washed," says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and cadavarian rigidity was already started.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word: Justice appears.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old commer, a disorder, a cryer.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has made the promise that it will be a priority during his mandate.
"I hope he will be as good as when he was Governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, states the prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victims of during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's sequestration was under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate, on Friday, that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of the largest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. army -- had failed to complain on many occasions about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
During a counter-interrogation with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Attorney General Ashden Fein stated that weekly records of visits made to Manning by officers during his nine months detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The counter-interrogation -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request requiring the Manning case to be classified on the grounds that the sequestration took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that his guards had reserved was "Amazing" and that the treatment he had received in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although officers interviewed him directly about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the officers in the visit had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not report the issues mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), but that did not mean that I had no problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission meeting to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The soldiers stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close monitoring for the risk of suicide -- for the protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to be withdrawn from this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning witnessed on Thursday his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison from the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and once fled because of the heat.
He added that not having been kept aware of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very anxious.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying sleeping during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also stated that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside of his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatments in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning questions about a statement reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked before the guards and other prisoners one morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the questions of the judge, on Friday, Manning said that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he should have let go of his cover that could have hidden his nakedness, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to let go of it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used his slip or tongues to hurt himself, but that he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongues, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he was to be found guilty before a military court, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defense stated that Manning is planning to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagone confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
The indictors against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, the collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all indictors are detained, he initiates forever criminal detention.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexico-Americans are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, when I arrived in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two paths: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Extranjeros").
I've stayed still for several seconds, not knowing which direction I'm going to.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, as is the one used by my friends in Boston when they say "Irish", or my friends in New York when they say "Italian".
Then I became Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth that saw my grandfather born, there was no need for special qualification or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I went to the "Olds".
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their predilection themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans would stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wished to join the United States and Canada, and to establish a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory in writing at the top of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official formulates the least criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that that country maintains with more than 35 million Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to deal with the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, less educated skin, derived from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we live today the American dream, we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream we live, not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
Furthermore, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the leading class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they feel like we were individuals of lower tribe and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between the Mexicans and the Mexicans, because the Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and the Mexicans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexico-Americans I know don't feel like they're part of any country.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
And now, to make the relationship a little more complicated, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing his interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American nationals that Mexico is a great country that we must definitely visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the inequalities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do it alone, amigos.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want to do so in the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Quarrels, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were dust-reduced; more than 140 Palestinians were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in the process of changing.
The Arab spring has been sparkling, and whether or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will be even more intensified.
However, there are all the reasons to think that this could help them get out of this mortal impasse.
A war that does not make any losers or winners
At first sight, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, the struggles of this week have strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will strive to force the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has wiped out a rage.
Having killed some of its leaders and relieved the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the world's poorest and overcrowded corners, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is gaining land on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, formerly the nearest Muslim alliance in Israel, has made and cause for Hamas; just as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilee and say that the growing Islamist curves around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamic-trend rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of Muslim Brothers under Muhammad Morsi's chairmanship in Egypt, far from the most populated and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily rejoicing public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that cannot be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put into a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its indefectible support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket shootings in Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that empires on the West Bank, the main part of what could be a Palestinian state, protecting the Jewish colonies that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more Bellicist party, the one of the leader Avigdor Lieberman approaching the election of 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian bastards bereave by giving them a state?
If they were to lead the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their head.
Perhaps the supporters of the line will win; but it may be that the Arab Spring changes it.
Even though Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Initiating a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire that is good-eyed -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a pout that is dedicated to blowing up one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give external people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to end the movement of weapons to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with field exchanges and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian State than the next proposal of a pseudo-state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also had every interest in what Israel agreed to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, it seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very strenuous vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packages of neutral cigarettes came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This Act entered into force in Australia is a first world, logos and colours have been replaced by dark green olive and terrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the objective was to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they never start.
"Although children are very young, they understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Tanya Plibersek, Federal Minister of Health, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children combine the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would revive the trade in the black market, which would provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"The negative consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had stimulated their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the demand for cigarette boxes, especially in silicone, to hide terrible packaging, has increased significantly two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost before Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boring thing, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population segment targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsoring and the obligation for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you have only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the indispensable place for excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves whether this is a mere citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has given himself the effort to make a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchested by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions - these countries have declared to WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package containing a photo of the mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I get arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, director of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging makes it difficult to store packages on the dials.
"Before I took an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them forever and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising the arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Passing half a day in an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child praise boring.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boring.
So should we welcome open-arm boring?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to that.
First of all, like many people, I thought boring was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case," says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek-Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompei there are Latin graffitis that point to boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boring.
The problem is that he has been defined, and discussed, in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, an aggregated professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After passing through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that is "to do something, but without getting into a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boring of apathy, he said, is that the person is not doing a task although she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boring, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Sadness can look very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while depressed people think that the problem is from them.
Sometimes we may think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Un Engagementd Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened to cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too high sound of a TV broadcast that had no connections, others just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group did not hear the sound band at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boring.
When you try to focus on a difficult or taking-up task, an interruption of attention can lead to boring, says Mark J. Fenske, an aggregated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you torture yourself or grab it, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigote learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a single voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "predisposition scale to bore" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "By the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I have no time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls," said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and need, among other things, numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blown.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience during which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of the teenagers said they were bored at school and during their homework, while 23 per cent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether today's boring percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boring good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to taking absurd physical risks, making bets or abusing certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between boring and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boring is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you look at TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will no longer be bored, but he has not learned to take care of himself or to settle himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he said.
Your child not only learns to entertain, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I do not think we should criticise it.
Being comfortable outside the constant boiling that activity and technology generates is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boring awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to start into something when noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, student in a university and football player in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without delay.
The police have ceased to accuse adults aged 21 and over of minor marijuana possessions, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for the acceleration of existing marijuana cases and continue to accuse people who own them.
At the same time, several cities in the Denver suburbs to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-authorized sales of marijuana in their neighborhoods.
"Things evolve so quickly that I don't know what's going on in the future," said Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Aurora Police, east of Denver.
The regulatory bodies of the State of Washington are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a license system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the target date of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether or not we want it, is premature on most marijuana regulatory states, first on use for therapeutic purposes and now on personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees appropriate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or a crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to establish an approved marketing of cannabis, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of the police, Oates, sent an e-mail to his officers stating that the "City lawyer" (representant of the Public Service) would no longer prosecute persons aged 21 and over who had small quantities of marijuana, and that the police had to stop indicting persons for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new judicial decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the District Attorney (Procuror of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to put pressure on users to disinfect themselves.
Currently, 119 people are charged with the possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are under other charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute those persons who committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where the voters rejected the initiative for limited marijuana consumption.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appear to be adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the Public Ministry of the County, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to categorize all cases of marijuana detention without delay.
"I don't feel like I'm wasted time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offering a legal and government framework suitable for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public department, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent a lot of their lives prosecuting people who consume marijuana, so do they have difficulty accepting that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are now becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and state representatives are planning a new legalized sales border, they are concerned about the federal government's guidelines, which always conceived the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of marijuana legalization hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite some media arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed the sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to be carried out in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will probably not penetrate the doors to seize small drug bags, there is a strong bet that it is opposed to authorized sales of personal marijuana authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor of Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not expected the federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local authorities approved moratoriums on the creation of new trades in marijuana, although it was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was misled and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
Not only today's students are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was an outstanding place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were disconcerted.
The journal of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that first cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson fakely stated that I was gone after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I escaped.
Yes, I fled because I had been subjected to intimidation and had been subjected to brimade constants.
Not because of my name rather outrageous, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one single reason, and in this so-called know-how bow, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behaviour: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do you tell me this today?
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-wing students is subjected to the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonders: Young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to student politics, which depicted the "Tories" as excentrics and neonazis.
It included student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, bores a full silver and moves with a chrome head cane.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as emittent bouquets of the creation of higher school costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", said to a Sunday newspaper that there was a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student in history at the Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the UCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JRC members towards those who are in the centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates and to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think of this in my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and was paralysing.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinic vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met with the others and teachers, I had a pre-speed of what would happen later.
I found out that the teachers were not only involved in the sarcasms against Tory students, but they also enjoyed them.
It was as if the policy regarding the grevist minors, the privatization and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victims of was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "would you want to translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pussy face, was easily involved.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make friends," he launched a harsh tone.
I went back to my room, inconvincing.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a little bit on my shoulder.
He was a student in the second year of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the UCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is taken as a target.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most young Tory claims to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I hardly tried to hide.
I stressed that I disagree with everything that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This strata has failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences, who ironically studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students resumed their abstention.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have only been able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of oestracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-determinist viewpoint of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies in Oxford, in the '40s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said patheticly to me.
They wouldn't do that, not in town with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's to smack you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Failed by my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, too, Tory, fell to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a working session led the next week, when another professor of history suggested the most serious of the world, that I was "a enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Inwardly shameful, I admitted to be a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treating them as "old crazy."
The delay was short.
It's my father who pushed the last oxford coffin.
At that time he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed rugged in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors abandoned.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can treat me as a wet chicken of crownichard.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Minister Tory, but also enjoyed an invariable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Couture Master", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian couturists.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the UK capital worth hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Couture Master", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the cornerstone of a story whose only protagonist is "he signore" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories such as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with love of royalty.
"At least, they don't crush their cigarette megots on your beautiful carpet as some stars of pop music do," says Baronel Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and welcomes with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to her cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a intimate friend of beauty of past times such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to famous.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charism of the couturier.
A few years ago, after a parade on the Place d'Espagne, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His mind was seen and felt in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which started working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass by fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Defiled with a noble line
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He loves well-educated people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a 60-metre wide glamour podium that offers the exchange of roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to scroll on the podium to admire a "public" dream wearing Valentino's main creations, such as Jackie Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Emperor Farrah Diba.
Among this audience of mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsbourg.
Naty Abascal and the couturer in 2006
Many of her clients say Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" belt and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he had made to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muses.
"I prefer it to everyone else for her feminity, her great love for women, and because it sublimes our beauty," says Feria's ex-daughter.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying jewelry, a dragged bustler and a decolleté to fall.
"It was a dream that became reality," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent in fashion, he is obsessed with the timelessness," explains the Italian aristocracy who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the greatest care, because a evening dress is not only a dress, she is also the whole of the memories she carries".
The "king" of fashion
The great final of Somerset House's exhibition was Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturer so calls his couturers) to make this dress in ivory silk with incrustations of pearls, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-metre tray.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high sewing of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
For years obnubled by the "knowledge" of the nobleness, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated by the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calm, his careful and perfect appearance have always jumped to my eyes," says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If she's a princess who says it...
The hardest occupation in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano are at risk of their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the scratched stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day up to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the earth's interiors solidifies to the contact of the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the stiff paths.
There is only 250 meters to the volcano wing that climbs to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers spend more than 40 minutes climbing this distance, at a turtle line, keeping the balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall into the precipitation.
They know that a false step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a mortal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents of euros for each kilo of sulphur extract.
Upstairs, it breaks a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were beasts of circus, and carrying heavy baskets hardly, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little downstairs at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, as can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian roupies (5 cents euros) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 roupies (83 cents of euros) as this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to produce candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to wash sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 roupies (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually travels three times a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to win 138,000 roupies (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a poverty for such an overhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 roupies (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million roupies (167 euros)", says the carrier who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 roupies (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they were Hinduists, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already started to pay him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Malled by life, this friendly and intelligent young person could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an insalubre wood mesh with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur keeps yelling at night, when its yellow colour becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defiing the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their account and are paid to weight.
In addition, they do not touch one of the 30,000 roupies (2.50 euros) of increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 roupies (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left the college.
He is able to carry up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so endured that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... which, of course, add their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, that three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a path of goats invaded by the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening my mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, aged 30, also works as a wearer of sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty persists from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one that makes human mules of the Kawah volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporens put responsibility for this lack of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unbelievable that these words come from an advertisement for mint pastills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to that, the video was spread as a powder tray on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polichinell in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the video advertising agency, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill "their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we feel it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launching pheromone fragrances or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it as lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year in politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2, considered as the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why do the Singaporens have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, states that this is due to "better education" and "more choice of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a broader range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of singles and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration in order to counter the decline in the population has created a resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are abundantly clothed xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese people who are accused of drawing wages down and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has experienced last year its worst electoral results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unwanted Consequences
While the decline in birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a country, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have started controlling the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes", which can be built in specific areas in the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale wins a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single life style and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the EL Developers Real Estate Company, says that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously placed in wheels if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with the Singaporens working in the centre's financial district, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
"The people are very stressful, the homes are expensive, as well as education, that's why people return it later," says a young team.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to have my money and my time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporens themselves who have the last word.
What's private online is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the private life domain that we can protect from any intrusion."
What is the private domain for less than 16 years?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by spreading on the Internet events that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, common users of the web.
In four of these cases, they combined the term "something very personal" on a personal basis and "the password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he is trying to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would be foolish," he said.
The young boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, people who are disguised, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are of the family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to remote parents or to my friends in a quick way," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The 14-year-old case of José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"I'm not worried because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or required it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyber harshness are not strange to the young boy.
A close to one of my friends was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it into a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
"Although I know it's cyber harshness," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and dismissed in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way of searching for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she mentions.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in education at Yale University and author of the book "Native and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they, children and young people are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective while most important for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use issues that make them think.
"Saying not to do so is not for anything," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"With the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same in social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, Professor of University, Primary Instructor and Education Advisor, states that it is essential for parents to read consciously the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners.
The UNASUR Summit ended without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VIth Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, and then stated that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian Government from time to time.
When they were interviewed on the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulated between the journalists was the information provided by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the day was the list of the presidents present, which caused some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who required more information.
Later, the Peru Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
In October last, Peru was host of the 3rd summit of the Arab South-Pays America (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although it had been requested by the press in an instance, it had not issued the statement called also the Declaration of Lima, as it had previously been announced.
On the official website of the ASA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited information to a maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Hague Court which sets a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both parties in the Lima trial against Santiago, which began on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and enforce the judgment that will resolve the disputes we are presenting today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country respecting international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," said President Piñera, giving a handful to President Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the IIC took place after Colombia announced this week the Bogota Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the International Court, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who had suspended Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the proceedings in the morning and closing the summit in Lima shortly after 12 noon.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the 31 project lines of action had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would set up "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
It informed that actions would be undertaken to improve "co-operation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug access, low-priced Internet access throughout South America, and to evaluate the risks of natural disasters jointly and effectively".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumph but must help to increase our productive matrix and maintain a better future for our populations," President Humala concluded.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were located on the cross-sectional axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the Union of the South American Nations," which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on the following Saturday in Mexico, to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgement by the CIJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will request a discussion with that country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilised and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to take the power of the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the Defense Ministers of the Block will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru provides the pro-temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, today stated that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example of Europe".
President Correa, who took part in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said at State TV, TV Peru, that the Europeans "was killed during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andine Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to be in the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuador President expressed support for the rebuilding of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José human rights pact.
Those who drop our ears never compromise themselves, on the other hand, we South Americans all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but rather respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at that time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice that required that he be subjected to a question on his territory about a alleged sexual offence while "swedish law allows him to do so by videoconferencing, which could be done since Ecuador's Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that its physical and mental health is deteriorated by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It works on everyone's health," he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian ambassade of London, which would be the award of an extra-direction that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he stresses that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with various European bodies," he mentioned.
And he thinks that "if Britain had granted the extra-fare from tomorrow, it would end".
And if Sweden, as it fully allows its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he explained that what he would not tolerate was "the midst, the bad faith and the lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverted politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that it was not this kind of journalist "the banks and the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that do dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his reelection, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and track the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "was to be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempts of disguised coups of state", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries through the judgment of the Hague International Court, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole to cross them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute on the maritime borders that opposes Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "favourable for Latin America to refer international forums if both countries agreed to accept a judgement so firmly as to be".
Regarding the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to give a third consecutive mandate, he indicated that he considered this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primarys of February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never been interested in me, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential mandate and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, Cuba.
I have just discussed with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez's health status," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded by an appeal for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when she was confirmed the test result: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid it to his family.
He decided to deal with his disease alone and began to inform himself about him and his harshness was such that he had just celebrated his 43th anniversary.
He was undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG) HIV unit, in which he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmates.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was without voice".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of HCG HIV Unit, and he considers that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system assignment of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who were not taking drugs: up to 30 years for a 200 CD4 rate and up to 50 years for those who reached a 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now on average 76 years old.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to UNAIDS's annual report), but it is also true that, since AIDS emerges, 60% of the nationally identified patients have died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral medicines has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see him, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an undisputable fact that "nine out of ten patients arrive when they are already presenting opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to carry out early diagnosis and, for this, to propose massive testing to all people who ask for it".
The specialists and members of the Jalisco (Coesida) State Council for AIDS Prevention agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to perform their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was already carrier of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, it's better I have fun three times a week," they say, "it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, on the march of World Day against AIDS.
Let them do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarises the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of 100, that's very good, but it results in that, today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes that this inefficient distribution be redirected; that the condoms be not only sold to the counters, but that they be found in the public toilet distributors and in the places that young people visit.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity.
It is also not a matter of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when he was asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
13.433 cumulative cases were reported (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminations are sexually, 6% blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
A judgement in appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national corporations with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
Therefore, it seems that the survival procedures for companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, counterfeiting international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the attack on the judgment of Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas on 15 June left the Mexican companies undefensely faced with the possibility of embargoing their property beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to refer to the Supreme Court of the United States on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the court of the case states that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the fifth circuit appeal court, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, the United Nations Model for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without the inter-society vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts committed by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the Vitro case is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Commercial Faillites.
In addition, what is certain is that, since there were still the votes of the subsidiaries, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the United States courts, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been with 45 votes to 37.
A data failed by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has encountered since 2008, without stopping from the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, causing costs to the country.
For the moment, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same appeal court for the whole vote, that is, with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The insurance appeal will require non-prosperity and will require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("ami of the Court"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, stating that it freed it from the conventions signed by both countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they use Vitro and they use the country.
General balance
The complaints by the trade unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former company leader, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silenced for several months, this was accused of fraudulent administration, and the Union of Aircraft Pilots has already encountered problems.
The court, hated by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction to justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically refused to provide information to the Public Prosecutor General of the Republic on a contractor's operation to withdraw from the bank's fideicommis F/589 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares from the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They seize the Dragon Mart
Meetings at the end of the week in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university teachers, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly located in protected areas and represents the largest of all the threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain the terms and conditions under which the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Conflict Commercial Agreement, known under the English signature of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an insult to freedom of expression in social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting those in the short term, Homex real estate promoter has launched the market for the Values Stock Exchange for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trotter of the basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain bleeding sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the basketball Federation.
"I wore several basketball hats throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes remembers during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind his out of the standard route, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
From all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or team manager.
"This was my best years, those I've enjoyed most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been many years of satisfaction, including the five contested championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a hard player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start with Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was pleased with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his duties and Mincy's duties in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us replay the last match, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we put a raclée to the United States team, which was quite similar to that that won bronze during the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medal and great joy in the Pre-Olympic Tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner to replace the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all prognosis.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking his path into account in the various leagues for which he played.
Who was the best portoric leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been one of the most glorious times of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s, the BC had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became known globally by John Ross Ewing's leading role, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scrupulous, fearable and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an oil magnet without scrub J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of rage in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a family release sent to The Associate Press for the Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear town of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of her wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her press officer Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life in depth," said Gray in a press release.
Doctors had diagnosed hepatic cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized having been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected a malignant hepatic tumour and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a charming genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and that he brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained shortly in the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are well received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his master's interpretation of the delightfully hating J.R. that Larry Hagman experienced his greatest success.
The drama series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around an episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of audiences at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most viewed entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had put her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played Ewing's role as a corrupt and insatiable man but charismatic smile: an unhonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to bring his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what I need as a epidemic for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, a coprotagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a man " immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.
At the moment neither Warner nor TNT have reported on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her birth in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met the young Swedish interior decorative Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities resided.
In 2001, he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s unpleasant memories)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt or affect anyone in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the concerned patients.
"I advise them, I trust them again, I come with them when they come to surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a little comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it's gonna be okay."
He was also an activist against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "Fin of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hamlet: the end of the Maya calendar, 21 December, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax blow that some called "the Armageddon of Debt" and an increasing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists at the end of time thought would trigger the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at the Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If we analyse what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we are devoting it to it, it was a very good period.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach about "the end of the world" this semester, which, in theory, will be the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker gave the course "Medias, culture and end of the world".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
"We analyse this because these ideas are proliferating with time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human conduct.
If, for example, nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyse films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a deputy professor of Art History and Anthropology, have made a team to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the imminent disaster, students need to study, create projects and complete their final examinations.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "to the same night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It has been complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, from the University of Rutgers-Camden.
For fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nurse, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate her.
But none of the students interviewed, and even more a teacher, told us to believe in the end of the world of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," says Julie Zele, last year's student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I admit that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, rising back to centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places of the world, people don't think about it," he assures.
This is the majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches the Philippines this year, answered quickly when he was asked if he knew that there were courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it was an exception from a superior authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgement, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date slightly.
Several of us told us that they thought they were going to party "from the end of the world".
"I sometimes call friends and we're laughing together," commented Samira Ford, 20-year-old communication student.
