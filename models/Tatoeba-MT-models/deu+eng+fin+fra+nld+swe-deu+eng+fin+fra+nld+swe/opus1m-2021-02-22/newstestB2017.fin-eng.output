28-year-old cook found dead in the Sanfrancisco shopping centre
Only recently, a 28-year-old cook moved to San Francisco was found dead at the staircase of the local shopping centre this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his business in order."
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscoan Frank Galicia, reports from San Francisco's Legal Medicine Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is investigated as a death crime.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream work when he left San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant kitchen master six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family. We're sorry," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frank that he first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his business in order.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and very heartfelt.
Her way of being with the family was to cook food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the current.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was a shiny diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anybody who knows about the case is asked to call the San Francisco police station's lead number 415-575-4444.
Claiming junior doctors demand new work fights
Representatives of British junior doctors (which are mainly responsible for specialist doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for authorisation for new working activities in the new employment agreement dispute.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is requesting support from the entire government for further work activities from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in July.
58 % of the members who participated in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night, the president of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter to JDC members in Twitter, where he says that the government was "disrupted" on issues that McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC Government has completely rejected the new draft agreement and calls for further formal negotiations on all of our concerns.
In response to the silence of the government, the Government of JDC has today tabled a formal request to the government of BMA requesting authorisation for the gradual expansion of labour struggles since the beginning of September."
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors have been in strike six times this year, including the first ones in the history of the British public health system that have ever seen the perfect work.
Johann Malawana, director of junior doctors of BMA, resigned after the vote, as he did not accept the negotiated contract terms recommended by BMA.
At meetings before the vote of the BMA, Malawana said that the agreement was good and should be accepted. 54 000 junior doctors and medical students participated in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would enter into force and that it would apply to the doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: External Alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met in order to negotiate and formally end the eight-month verbal war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish official brother in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that there was a greater desire for reconciliation at Ankara.
The parties did, but they did,
But Putin's smile looked subtle, and he didn't much warm up even with his own reluctant measure.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of Mr. Putin's "good friend" five times, according to a report.
I didn't keep my bills on my own.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad would ever have happened.
I myself understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the continued vileys from Putin showed that the Russian chief has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing that Mr Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was anger.
Putin attacked Ankara with the most stringent words and accused him of stabbed his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a presumed friend.
Recovering real confidence will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media went on a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turkish people were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has banned the charges.
The official message from Peter, however, was that it was time to move forward.
In the end, this meeting was only held so that Mr Putin received the apology he asked for from President Erdogan.
This might have led Russia to some kind of victory.
The benefits of the proclamation of severe arms are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power last month in the failed coup of power.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey severely, in particular the ban on charter flights, since, normally, several million Russian tourists travel annually to the Turkish coast.
The amount has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, travellers and charterers will certainly be doomed by relief when air traffic can finally be continued.
They put their faith in the outbreak of the late season in the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, the state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when Turkey's agricultural products are allowed again.
"You toured there, the tomatoes back here," was drafted in the article of the Economic Journal in Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
He is angry with the West because he thinks that the West reacts instinctively to the attempt to take power.
Without forgetting the old aggression of Turkey's EU membership negotiations and the involvement of Putin, which is enthusiastic to take advantage of the cool intervals and to break Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support to the elected authorities after the attempt to take power.
This was obvious for Moscow, who has its own concern about the exchange of power.
As a result, Russia and Turkey, at their peak meeting in the Pramous seafronts, could transmit a picture described by an analyst as the "external alliance": two countries who experienced being abandoned and treated by the West, united their forces.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between these two.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It is very important to say that, after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both Presidents told us at the press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The President of Turkey decided not to answer the question of differences in the countries, while Mr Putin, on his behalf, emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO Member State by the shooting down of a Russian fighter, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State will even be in conversation.
The Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the Director-General of the RBS Bank, the operation of the Bank outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand initially joined the Bank's global objectives.
The bank had to withdraw from its objectives when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that period, brand strategies have used RBS to protect other consumer financing brands.
It sponsored international sports with millions of pounds, such as Six Nations Rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been viewed as the right way to release more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used as a RBS abbreviation.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of the headquarters and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during the presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "BBS is turning into an investment brand and that is why our staff are working, because we are now turning much more into a bank of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in sponsoring sports.
"It is now the right time to turn into a bank containing different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the President of the Bank.
"Three years ago it would have been very unusual if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have introduced brands.
But our work and focus on the needs of our customers instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rided Predilection to win in Newmarket and reached his 3,000.
The detor sprays the champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant for him 3,000 winnings.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championships Series in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this stroll by riding on his horse to Predilection twice the same night on the track of his own place. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this row in the races running on a smooth track.
He has previously been able to do the same with Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple master hockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is also here.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The competition event is not large, not any Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility."
The Dettor will receive the horrors with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a peak in the obstruction races, and they are master hockey Richard Johnson and 20 times retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-year-old Derby winner, 4 493 winners
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is not surprising that she just reached this rowstone, which few have been able to reach.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical advantage is the one that separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and his heart has brought supporters to the species for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would already have won 6 000 races if he didn't compete only in weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the UK races has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a living person, which is good for a British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori whispered his achievements in a distinctive way by jumping dively down from his horse's back.
"Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing for two decades from flying goals to flying nudes.
There's been a way up and down.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but in addition he has survived the aircraft accident and was in a competition ban because of drug abuse.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had difficulties in starting, but he showed admirable strength of nature, appeared to his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a while he is not going to end his career – Dettori has recently said that he wants to continue his career until at least 50 years old."
Putin fired Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
The Russian president Vladimir Putin abruptly fired his head of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's trusted inside for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed as a Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin press release, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov's duties as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration", but no justification was given for the termination.
As of 2012, Anton Vaino was appointed Deputy Head of Ivanov.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
The persecution born in Tallinn in 1972 graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president's protocol department and the government office, reports the Russian-language website of Kreml.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment with the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your position as Head of State, which means making bills and monitoring the implementation of the guidelines you have given."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been a member of Vladimir Putin for a long time, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting of the Russian state television with President Putin, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his mission on his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the Kamers, there are few explanations that convince them, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are fired from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
Russia has been highly suspicious about the official claim that a man who is praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents the words of Ivanov to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult job for four years.
Now I've been the President's Head of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
When Putin served as Chief of the Federal Security Service (FSB) by the KGB at the end of the 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Head.
When Putin came into power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At times it was thought that Ivanov could become after the second period of Russian President Putin, because the Constitution would have prevented the election of Putin for the third period.
However, the mission went to another of Putin's neighbours, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, and then he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – Star Thomas Gibson of the FBI scientists series was fired after hitting the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The series produced by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios reported fires in their joint press release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as Gibson in the series, had made an apology on Thursday before he was notified of his resignation.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry that this happened," he says in his press release.
Information about how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, will be published later, will be reported in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios newsletter.
Previously, the 54-year-old Gibson, Dharma & Greg, has been involved in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," says Gibson on Friday in his newsletter.
"I was hoping to see the series until the end, but it's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans that the series would have ever wished."
The 12-series production period begins in the United States on 28 September.
The mysterious shore of fish to the Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been sucked by the storm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seaside, published images in the Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the emergence of these five - inch fish.
Queensferry crossing bridge is now connected to Fife
The project at a price of GBP 1.35 billion is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected Queensferry's crossing bridge to the northern deck and the land bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four portions between the "national threats", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 vino wires.
The project at a price of GBP 1.35 billion is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from land to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in building the bridge, and only this part of the bridge has been used to build more than 30,000 concrete and steel.
Despite mass size and weight, building a bridge between the bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extreme precise installation tolerances.
Now almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place, and the final part of the deck is getting its concrete deck in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, Head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge portion is always a major urinary pillar in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water construction sector.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower wall, then we had to close the remaining north side (i.e. the earthside) brush.
This was done by dragging the north side of the bridge 700 mm southward.
This was a massive and at the same time a high level of precision.
Massive because the earth has a length of 222 meters and a weight of about 6,000 tons and it had to be pulled up at an angle of 3%.
And demanding high precision, because the tolerances that the working team had to comply with were very small — just a few millimetres.
Luckily everything went well."
Moelfre Bay rescue facility tells me about three men's miraculous rescue
Anglesey, in front of his fishing boat, the three men who had fallen under water were saved like a miracle.
Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station made an alarm on Friday at 13.20 p.m. local time of its crew's accident in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued without a pilot.
"We saw the boat rotating right next to them and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, a lifeboat driving Moelfre.
By the time we got into the waters, the strong winds had, fortunately, transported the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat rescued two men, while the third, 60 years old, was found exhausted in the trunk and without rescue loops.
They were all taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men who have been subjected to water are still alive and perfectly well.
The boat engine had an emergency ignition ring, but it had for some reason dismantled the boat from the man who was drove.
They had real luck on their way."
The Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have chosen why teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but rather stay inside to stare at their windows.
Pokémon Go makes people get out of the couch and move.
Initially, it took only a television view, then the video games came and the latest smartphones.
So it is amazing to note that technology and exterior movement do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a gaming application from a video game created in the 1990s (which later was also made a series of drawings, cards and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped a little before the new game came available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to enormous interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
Shortly explained players go out to search their smartphones for pokémons that are followed by GPS. When you find pokémon, it can be "photographed" (by displaying your phone) or "capture".
The wilderness has been playing a video game younger than a generation and lifting his backs out of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the amount of steps taken by the "average person" in the day.
Washington Post recently told us about the Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which found within two days of the game launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know who of the users play the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data of the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns, in which people are encouraged to get up from the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day, have evoked deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be reduced.
Regularly mobile patients are less likely to suffer from cancer or depression.
Movement helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The finest thing in the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people do something they enjoy.
This achieves three basic health - supporting issues: exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt it is possible to even have new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disgusting joy ruiners.
And yes, someone can walk around the door when playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
For even though smart phone applications like Fitbit might have followed your activity before, they did not give reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The news attraction disappears, and use decreases in time.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be more games that combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the exercise and health of people who go hunting.

Simone Biles captured gold in the women's chair training program.
Forget the pressure.
Forget jumping.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The jaws are locked with a perma.
Great in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, an American 19-year-old tele-player won a multilingual championship and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
His total score of 62,198 was clearly better than the teammate "Final Five" with Aly Raisman and the Russian pronssilist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles in the United States will be presenting at the final of the individual competition for women's tele training in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, 2016.
Biles became the fourth in a row and the fifth American woman of all ages, who won the multiplication championship. So she strengthened her reputation for the best of her generation or even for the best of all times.
Biles burst into tears when his total final scores came to be visible and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to completely new dimensions and raises him to the same class of sports with other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the most powerful performer of all times".
There was still one final competition in Brazil, which took place above all between Biles and his own and the burden of great expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be disappointed.
The United States Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman take over after winning gold and silver at the final of the individual competition for women's plays in the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, Brazil. 11.8.2016
On Tuesday, Biles won the first gold medal as a point for the Martha Karoly, who was co-ordinated on i, and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was on the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which contains a series of volts known as his card – is adapted to Latin music that could well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
From their grandparents' adoption and coach Aimee Boorman's mother, Boorman has become a powerful figure. Boorman found a girl when she was on a day-care tour at the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multiplay competition after the summer of 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the small leadership of Blackfina in two rounds, it was like clothing.
There was a tree and a permanto in which Biles is a defending world champion.
He returned to the management position after reaching 15,433 points and crowned the final result with 15,933 points from the perma.
Raisman squeezed him mildly while waiting for final points — which was just formality — and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white and blue glowing color, when his dream of writing in his book was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge for a four-year competition, when he first awarded a third place, but then lost the pronss to Blackfina with a recurring round.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team "mother" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanto program and thus rose from a defeat position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
With regard to Biles, this 19-year-old twitter, which was made earlier in the week, has now a completely new meaning:
Police tells me three music in the car was the victim of a serial killer.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most destructive mass murder in ten years. The victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, reports the police release on Thursday.
According to the authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12 June.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots and then fled with another car, says the press release.
The police suspect that there was probably no robbery because the attacker did not take the bags or the $2,900 found in the hands of another adult victim.
The Phoenix police reporter, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
"It's common for them that they have occurred in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told CBS's subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late brown Nissa in the 1990s, the late black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln in the 1990s.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related to each other and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the venue.
The Witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a press release telling us about the shooting on an empty open-package car only half an hour before the three-shooting, and in both cases the shooter is believed to be the same.
The scientists found seals and picked up bullets and bullets from the car seat.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalia: "These things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of the other agemates, Edmund has a microcephalia, or a birthly smallness, due to her mother Elizabeth Picciuto’s genetic disorder, which she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I wouldn't survive this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not at all true – of course you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and perhaps never survive at all.
Some doctors went so far that they suggested placing a child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't believe that there was no longer such a practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks through the roller.
Edmund got up and started to sit down when he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
But he's slowly moving his own pace.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
He loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is presenting the sign that Edmund has invented, meaning "sing to me".
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean a common sign language, but also a number of visas that Edmund himself has invented.
Microcephalia may have several different diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund, or pregnancy virus infections, such as ashes or zica virus.
Symptoms and forecasts vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with zicavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
"I kept doing, how it happens to us,
How we're gonna do it."
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by zicavirus.
"Things are getting better.
It's the way things are going.
"You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused major rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared emergency due to heavy rains and widespread floods.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-Eastern Louisiana and South Mississippi flooded over their cavities and spread to the vast area as a result of severe rainfall.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana says that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that there is already assistance on their way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, Director of the National Security and Emergency Preparedness Office, reports that the Agency will receive requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand sacks.
According to Steele, only the Tangipaho County has requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the weather service, water may be added to the area 76–127 mm.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, the Committee River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to the weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the rivers may be flooded under the Baton Rouge suburbs.
In addition, he says that floods in the Ascension district pose a threat, because the flooding rivers are slowly emptying into Lake Maurepas.
In Louisiana Liverpool, the Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state of Mississippi, was already higher than ever on Friday at 9:00.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississip.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and nephew, were earlier near Glosteria on Friday.
Hansford, 62, tells me that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose fast during the night.
The other nephew who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came with continuous feeding," Hansford says.
"It stretched to my scale."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she lived in the area.
Hansford tells me that he himself and his family members have all injuries, and he himself is the only bathing skilled person.
Rescue workers had saved all three great military trucks and taken them to the Gloster fire station, where they kept shelter on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods spread rapidly when the heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation regulations.
He reports the information from a observer close to Livingston that almost 350 mm had rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has fallen strongly after the rain that began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that, due to the flooding of heavy roads and streets, the inhabitants of the district of Tangipaho were forced to escape their homes and school hours were cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangiphaa had told CBS's subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has gone to both of them.
Robby Miller, director of the district, reports that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained in prison.
Evacuated shelters have been opened to Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
In Hammond City, almost twenty streets in Tangipahoa County were forced to close because of the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sand bags to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, member of the City Board.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi the rain continued evenly on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy tells me that on Thursday there was reports of a close house under flood, but on Friday there had been no information yet.
Chief of the Shopper Value Foods store Keith Townson tells me she's been living in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received several bullets in his body, survives Philadelphia's shooting incident
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old, who has been shot this week in town.
The grandparents of the child told him that the boy on the CBS Philadelphia channel was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in the legs, legs, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his small body was full of bullets," said the son's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital, and several surgery has been carried out.
The family tells the TV company that he's believed to survive.
He was going to start the first class at the local level.
Brown was one of the four people shot in Germantown.
There were also two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
According to CBS Philadelphia, the second 29-year-old condition was reported to be critical and two were stable.
According to the TV company, the child was found next to a 29-year-old in a critical condition on the front of the car.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The site was full of gun-type hulls coming from different guns.
"It is absolutely clear that this was the ongoing battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the corridor.
There have been several armed fighters, and they have actively participated in the shooting," said Philadelphia Police Commander Anthony Ginaldi to the TV station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and the police have been told to go through surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old shot in the city this week was a girl who was hit by a misleading bullet on his hand when he played on Tuesday in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
Under this name, I call women's Olympic Team of Trainees, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been in every Summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States has never been as overwhelming as now.
Secondly, this team's three athletes, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The team's composition, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female-trainer has been African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were placed on 1 and 2.
This is amazing.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the races, and all of America hurried.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible achievements of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the amazing and mastery training programmes.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American who won gold in the multiplication of the women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman won silver for himself.
The view is at the top of the species, but it does not look the same at the tearing lessons throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), because the next team will have only four athletes, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that tearing is a expensive sport and that athletes practice mainly in private tearing clubs that maintain their parents. The costs of training, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most of the training clubs are located in wealthy residential areas that are able to support activities.
The teaching of teaters takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long - term commitment to the family of teaters.
Simone Biles trainer Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez trainer Maggie Haney have both trained the sportsmen since they started the tearing.
We need to provide cheaper and better available tear training teaching for the countless young girls who have raised the enthusiasm of Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own training foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for telecommunications training for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have gone to national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown, Detroit, in order to offer high-quality telecommunications training for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic range.
Teline training develops strength, inclination and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has raised the enthusiasm for thousands of young girls who now want to start tele training, and that is absolutely amazing.
Participating in some sports is very important, especially for girls.
It's an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl force" you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to decide on changes to the remuneration and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58 per cent of the 37 000 junior doctors who participated in the vote, i.e. the specialist doctor, rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt told us about plans to make the agreement mandatory and said that the British public health system (NHS) was "no country" and that all further delays were harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that includes changes to the practice of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in unsocial times.
Mrs McCourt, President of the BMA Committee on Junior Physicians, gave an opinion last night, saying: "The junior doctors continue to be very careful with the proposed agreement, particularly with fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks since the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so we have to move forward now, because the time is running.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has acted unwillingly and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt has to act now, repeal the implementation of the contract and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, junior doctors will be ready for new work fights."
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and advisers were asked to assist the striker doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the British Trade Union representing doctors.
The BMA trade union wants a better week-end bill for 54,000 junior doctors that the contract would deal with.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors that they would not start new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Employment activities are accomplished very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services that already operate at the outer borders and cause concern, anxiety and disorders for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have held negotiations with the Committee on Junior Medical, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of mismatches.
Employees hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returning from work, training costs, mutual recognition of the education programme, free learning and gender pay gap in the care sector would be a sign of the seriousness of workers, health education England, and the Ministry of Health, responsible for health education, would like to maintain agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
On a day about 2,40 €, a medicine that pays may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are being given a daily dose of approximately € 2.40 when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
Anticoagulant ticagrelori reduces the risk of new heart attacks in heart disease patients.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and evaluates the introduction of new treatment methods has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A yearly heart attack in England occurs in about 140,000 people, of whom a quarter relapses or a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fat that accumulates to the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaster breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot gets loose, it can go along with the blood circulation and prevent the blood flow into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is greater in people who have had a heart attack once.
The British AstraZenecan ticagrelori, sold under the name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the probability of drums.
The NICE draft guideline published today recommends that tikagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, then the dose is reduced to 60 mg and aspirin is given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for the Evaluation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: "Although there are effective treatment methods that effectively prevent disease progression and symptoms, even a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can have a very negative effect on human quality of life.
We have been shown that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in the case of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend using the treatment method for a longer period.
Because of the atmosphere of political correction, the scourge in the Muslim regions flourished
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year due to corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The atmosphere of political correction led to the closure of the eyes of a widespread opposition in Muslim communities, reveals the government report published today.
The former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticised the police, election observers and city councils for their overcrowding of their eyes "for ethnic and religious hypersensitivity".
According to Pickles, former Minister of Regional Administration and today known as a force against corruption, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside the polling stations in order to protect the intimidated voters.
He suggested that the voters should present the identity certificate in order to prove their identity when they came to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only state his name and address.
In addition, the report suggests that fingers should be baptized after voting in unleashing music so that no one could vote twice.
They should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He urged that journalists' access to the documents of the State Council and the decisions of informal committees and working groups be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent elections, but also to combat fraud against corruption and economic interests and a culture that favours them more widely in local authorities," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal of the Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered Mayor Lutfur Rahman to dismiss his duties due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court considered that Rahman "failed" the religious feeling of its Muslim community and disturbed its critics by accusing them of racism and Islamism.
Rahman was said "to use his campaign as the basis of the religious duty of every believer Muslim to vote on him".
Up to 300 voices were questioned or misleadingly given by the person voting by making himself another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence was found from the whole country.
He expressed his particular concern about the postal opposition, in which it was reported that members of the Muslim community in high position had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement of a certificate of identity at the polling point.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some of the vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the parents, particularly in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... the state institutions had stopped their eyes from such activities because of the "politically correct" oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the treatment of post-voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent the "sufficiency of voices".
Theresa May's current report also calls for more stringent checks in connection with registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to submit an identity certificate before voting.
Doing fingers after voting to unleashing music so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for an automatic post vote.
Prohibition of dealing with the voices and envelopes sent by mail from political activists.
The police have the right to set up security chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the law in order to make it easier to raise intimidation claims under the 1983 Law on the Extension of Voting Rights of the People Act.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Allowing English in polling stations only (except Wales).
Enhanced training in order to ensure that staff supervises the rule that only one person can go to the polling centre at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and finds it "astonishing" that after Tower Hamlet's case, no criminal charges were brought.
"The Court of Justice dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for the purpose of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"He was found guilty without due doubt and the criminal threshold of evidence was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "fighting checks" of the districts responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
"The decision of the Court last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was an awakening," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its inheritance as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by a worrying and concealed election fraud and the banning of it by some people."
The resemblance of the Olympic Biker with Duchess Catherine and other twins are wild at the Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics became wilder from Pauline Ferrand-Prevo, a French biker, with a resemblance to the Duke of Cambridge.
But according to the social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only athlete who fights the championship and has a similarity with a well-known person.
In honour of the Rio races and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL gathered a list of all the Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood artists is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellisonia (Vas.) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duke Catherine's twin creature, many people have noted in social media how a sniper could be an actress favored by Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, a team of American men's flexible shooting team, caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures she published, in which she excites the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the high level of social media and admitted that he had heard from the child that he reminded DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance myself as so big, maybe shrimp and snorkels except," Brady Huffington Post said.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
During the 2012 London competitions, the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were challenged, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these competitions.
Major and obvious Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina has been called the double creature of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the swimmarados, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared with Matthew Morrison, known from the Glee television series for years.
This user says that Nathan Adrian is an "atletic version" of the Inception movie's actor.
Similarly, for a long time, the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett have scored the equivalence between the two powerful corner hairs and lips.
The Russian silver-amitist Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCordi, not only because of her browned skin and hair, but Nathan Adrian, the United States team, is a "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (vas.) and the actress of Dexter's series Jennifer Carpenter (right), are similar to each other's faces and eyes.
Not the only thing: this Twitter user was happy when others also saw the equality.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for a couple's resemblance.
A tweeter recently expressed his satisfaction when "others on the Internet agree on the equivalence of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the Dexter-series actor really remind each other of their faces and eyes.
Many have also seen the resemblance of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's smile and gold-winning athlete Gabby Douglas and Anna return! for the film Gabrielle Union's wide smiles.
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes for saying a Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis, instead of the fourth, of Ai Yanhan, 14 years old, in a women's 4 x 200 m freeze message, threw CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian radio company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "disappeared smells" and "dy like a pig" during the race.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to launch his own opinions at the end of the final 4 x 200 m women's release message.
MacDonald, who was taken into CBC's excerpt to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimt a message at the second part at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to get caught out of China.
Lookers around Canada react quickly after shocking the commentator’s tone and language use.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig???
The idiot didn't realize he was in the transmission yet."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, a woman's 4 x 200 meters freeze message in the final, was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled up with the angry Byron MacDonald comments, and many called for his resignation.
The tweeters didn't keep their words when they heard how ignorant Byron Macdonald was.
Twilight Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist crowd.
Scott Russell, host of the CBC mission, quickly regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comments made on the swimming performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
In the end, CBC had to regret more than 90 times people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Co-rapporteur Scott Russell had to express his regrets on behalf of MacDonaldi.
Afterwards, CBC copied and glued his regrets to more than 90 other Twitter comments complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also made a public apology quickly.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for being sent.
We quickly apologised to our viewers yesterday night, and we also expressed an apology to our followers of social media.
For reasons of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regrets in the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that it didn't mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for my comment last night after the women's communication," MacDonald said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Without saying that it is clear that I did not mean anything degrading, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, a woman in the midst of the trade, who was an advisable woman, shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark to fit the underwear.
He further worsened the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, took them off his foot and put them back in the shelf.
He continued the rotation and finally tried four underwear in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston.
The Primark chain store at Folkestonen Bouverie Place, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back in a shelve
At the same time, the mother of two children in the shop Jenny Davidson tells me that after trying underwear, a woman unknown dressed and walked out of the shop without buying anything.
He tells me about what happened, "The people weren't believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took the underwear out of the shelve, took off her own tricon and underwear and dressed them on.
He did not try to do it unawarely, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone stared when he took the underwear he had tested out of his leg, and apparently did not like them because he put them back in the shelves.
He did it three more times before finally decided that they didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes – and he didn't think of a person who would finally buy the underwear he had come from."
Kent City, 33-year-old Davidson, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone takes home the underwear that someone else has worn and washed."
The case happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that trade personnel were trying to remove those clothes from sales once the woman had left – which is right.
It would be awful to take new underwear home and notice that someone else has come from them without that they would have been washed then", says Davidson.
Primarki’s reporter commented: “Primark is aware of the situation in the People’s Movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend yourself against the armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Grand Master Rhon Mizrach, the Krav Maga Association, in New York, and asked how to cope with a robber or an offender in the vicinity of the gun.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker is approaching you or behind.
If the attacker approaches backwards, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun so that it stays between your elbow and your shoulder, and hit the attacker on your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knees, and when he goes double the pain, stick him on the face with a gun steep and retreat by holding a gun directed at him.
The technology is similar if the armed attacker is approaching the front. You have to move away from the shooting line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker cannot be triggered.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker, withdraw and hold the gun against the attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest thing is to get rid of the robber by giving up your cash — unless you are the major champion of Krav Maga.
The world guide traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and his twisting reflexes on hard trials by licking the dirtest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The Suffolki rider and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking euro banknotes, handcuffs at Piccadilly Circus, the train toilet wash button and Russian general phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see himself and show the viewers where they were pushing their tongue.
The experiment was made in a documentary film Ian Wright – on the basis of internal power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the laundry button on the train toilet may be devastating, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On a trip to the various European coins, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about the strengthening of good bacteria in the intestine and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he arrowed caused nothing but a malicious mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestine by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The licking of the handcuffs and toilet rinsing button at railway stations undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: "I've been quite careless about my health since I was a child, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth, such as mosquito, worms and throat."
In the movie, she really showed her reputation as taxable.
The border came against only in a brutal public bathroom in Russia.
The Luminometer measured more than 4,000 units from the sample.
As a result of the comparison, it should be noted that the amount in the washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came against in the Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to arrow when the luminometer measured 4000 units as a result — the same figure in washed hands is less than 60.
Wright adventures in a documentary film produced with Valio, Ian Wright – an internal power track, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as in the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
Nothing is dirtyer than that.
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film with Ian Wright – internal power in cooperation with Valio.
Wright received the Valio Gefilus, containing milk acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the bone bacteria stock and resistance of the intestine.
Vali's head of category for snacks, juices and innovation products Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We wanted to offer consumers something quite new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we ended up asking Ia to come along."
The intestinal health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a broader context instead of simply talking about products and to tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The intestinal health has become a global trend, and this document will allow us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our humor store!"
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds to this: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, licking some of the objects was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty rays on the tape."
In the 2015 poll, 84 per cent of respondents linked milk acid bacteria, in particular to the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 per cent reported that they had used products that had been added to milk acid bacteria at least at times.
The family destroyed the city's renthouse in Saltash, Cornwall, before her wedding.
The troubled family left behind the damage of 50,000 pounds in the city's renthouse after they had been rejoiced because of the terroristization of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been married from their apartment in Cornwall in Saltash following numerous complaints against a couple.
When the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the representatives of the rental company said that the apartment was in a renovation house with shock.
There were bullying holes in the walls, cars had been cut off, garbage had been spread to the ladders and the walls had been stabbed with graffits.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a full nightmare for people living here, no one should have to face this.
There is a lot to weigh, because the property is probably not known as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
"The family is infamous, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family’s horrific power included street fights with baseball militias, intimidation of neighbors, drug use and mediation, and hard voice shouting, fighting and cursing.
In June, Skeldon, a 47-year-old signed lease agreement, received an order on unsocial behaviour.
In several rooms of the house under threat of decommissioning, old waste was found.
Previously, drugs had been sold out of the house, and floor cars had been cut off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police were forced to call regularly.
Cornwall's Housing Agency abandoned the couple by compulsive means this week after giving them 11 weeks of additional time to move away voluntarily.
Enlightened neighbors were grateful for the wedding — they said their life was earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we haven't used to it!
It's gonna be wonderful now that they've finally been cast out."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Director of the Housing Office of Cornwall, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
The garbage and old toys were thrown on the wild wall of the renthouse.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, because the wedding is always the last measure that Cornwall's Housing Office is considering.
This was very difficult because the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the Community who participated in the work and offered us courageously to provide information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of the neighbours and send a message that an unsocial behaviour is not accepted."
Fitzpatrick tells me that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in twenty.
A dirty mattress found in one bedroom after the wedding
The houseworkers now have to clean out the waste packs surrounding the house.
The police made a ride in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, in addition to waves and other supplies and $1,700 in cash.
Skeldon received a fine when he was found guilty of possession of Class B drug in order to sell it.
He claimed that the money was for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in the car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been told to move to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were ruined with graffits.
The police say they're calling for a resignation to tenants who violate the lease rules.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say that this wedding is a clear warning to tenants who are constantly subjecting to the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they want without charges, as to those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and unsocial behaviour and continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Lowerly flying, shineing on the beach, an army shower machine frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Portugal's Aveiro.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed at an alarming low level.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when the tourists came into the power of the escape, when the low-flighted shower machine crashed over the full beach.
Dramatic pictures show how the military aircraft arrives near contact on the sandy beach from the tourists taking the sun in North Portugal's Aveiro.
The holidaymakers stood up in their feet when they had an understandable concern about the rock of the engines that began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The case happened last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures and videos of the dramatic passing flight was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed the beach twice down, and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall to the ground."
Nuno Arrooja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly came to sight and flew alarmingly low.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force informed that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight aimed at identifying coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by close forest fires hampered visibility, but according to the air forces, it did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of continent Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
Today, the Portuguese air forces informed that because of the mist and the poor visibility of the sanctuary, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
I lost the result of the first half of the year better than expected
The social and health district of South Karelia (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million more effective in January - June.
In the first half of the year, the result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment warranty was carried out in all activities.
This year, Exote is trying to shorten the lines of action.
Exote covers the deficit previously incurred by the surplus.
The remaining share may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The results are expected to be better than planned at EUR 4.6 million throughout the year.
The Government of Exoten will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border icers swore a military oath in Immo
On Friday, 70 crews at the Border and Marine School swore a military oath.
The military whale event of Border and Marine School crews was held in Immo on Friday.
The Tenth Special Ice Course was held at the equipment's sports field.
The military vow swore 70 of the crew.
Special border icers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve for 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for as a special limit icer.
They invited 250 of them to the selection tests.
Special limit icers have been trained in Immo since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in the context of the valación took part in five wartimes of border forces veteran.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A lot of rubbish above - criminal investigation helps detecting crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
From the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police institutes has operated by the RTA, the criminal investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
A total of four police officers are present in the police department in Lahti and Hämeenlinnan.
It's pulled up by a sergeant placed in the Bay.
Chief of Staff in Lt. Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a dedicated civilian to IT in Hämeenlinnan.
Everyone's working in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and need, says Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces a variety of reports to the other police.
It has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the most recent reform of the police's working methods.
The aim was to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police would never go on the spot until they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities will be targeted wherever they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal investigation centre was established, under three national units, and a criminal investigation unit was established for each police station.
The PTR centre in Vantaa, in connection with the Central Crime Police, runs nationally.
The PTR units work according to their name from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, for their part, are working in areas divided according to police agencies and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Information extends outside your area
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police station.
Inquiry also extends beyond the borders of your own institution, because crime does.
People working in the RTA unit have better basic police IT skills.
With the help of registers, alarm database and observations, the Unit is seeking to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or crimes that are similar to each other.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal investigation.
All people have their own way of doing.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of making, the factor is made up of a certain type of image.
Seriesing can be done either on the basis of a practice or by a person, depending on which police have more information.
The criminals learn from their mistakes
The workers of the RTA unit don't move the city's necks up, but their work is not fully public.
The methods used by both criminals and their own are not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus attempting to prevent police crime attempts.
The police will be told publicly about the procedures if they predict to pose a threat.
Such a case, for example, was newsed from the beginning of the summer, using a method of marking empty dwellings in housing breaks.
There, the authors put a boot, a needle or a tape on the outer door of the apartment, which they tried to see whether the inhabitants were actually on their way.
The pre-investigation material shall be public for at least the parties concerned.
The Analytical Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they have made.
The most ugly are ordering a district court protocol, which can indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found here.
The next time, the thieves will leave their gloves in their hand.
The case has been interviewed with Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppä from Hämeen police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from East Finland police, Detective Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuun police station and Detective Arto Tuomela from Central Crime Police.
The police are collecting and analysing information to plan practical action.
Underpinned by a reduction in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken already 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
Kingdom cooperation collects information outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl joining fathers died in Syria
The news tells us that one of the three British schoolmen who joined Isaiah last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee tells her family that Sultana died in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air attack to Raqqa, which is the base of Isis in Syria, told ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was just planning to escape from the land of war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a testament so that people can understand that this is a real risk when going to the war area - and that makes people give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015 Sultana, together with two other Eastern London schoolgirls, went on a plane flying to Turkey and continued to travel by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married the Isis fighter in Syria and remained widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the Presidential candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm the appointment of Garland since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the majority president of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, the next president elects a person to fill the place of Anton Scalia, the former Supreme Court.
Reid said at the phone talk on Thursday that he predicted Clinton to choose Garland with "a lot of certainty."
The reporter of Reid later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not talked directly to Clinton about whether this was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "show the boat" by selecting someone else.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the district of Columbia.
Reid says that the republicans who prevent Garland from appointing are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "commanders" and "assistants".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with the photographer David Bellemeren and markets the calendar made in the 1970s and inspired by Pirell for 2017.
Instead of celebrities models, they want to find the top models of the next generation of their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, Managing Director of Treats, told earlier this year that his naked leaves differ from the old school's Playboy magazines, for he said: "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this to women."
Apparently, he thinks the same thing about the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classic nakedness, where women, even where men, can enjoy and inspire these pictures of the female body, without disturbing them," says Shaw in the press release on the calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful artwork."
As a model, you can send your photos through the network or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl attraction: Who buys records?
All alone, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write your angry objection in the commentary section with the name NoEveryoneMean-old Men, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is not a millennial-generation buum behind the new coming of much spoken vinyl records, when millennials want to know a physical object in their hands, but rather have a middle-life nostalgia in the background.
The age of the person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, those of the age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a desire for hobbies to pick up records, but it is an emotional meaning: older buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to hide their feelings (56 % vs. 53 %) and enjoy being alone (69 % vs. 66 %).
But do YouGov's results be true?
If this blog had been broadcast on television, the camera would follow me walking along the vibrant Soho Street, on my jewelry's grey jar suit. I would lively, turn my hand into a cup and say something about traditions, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rogueness when the hotels, the Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before private entrepreneurs owned premises, there are still a lot of special disc stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I search for very close men visiting these shops and try to monitor their age and quality.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, which I follow from the Sister Ray movement (customers at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (customers at the moment eight middle-aged men, one likely twenty-two women) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends an extra time learning about the supply of shops.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3000 to 4,000 discs."
These records fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so many albums and singles, is partly in his available revenues. He is now able to buy discs that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and moneyless.
"I got a lot of things in the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts that will enjoy their own company, and add: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my bad."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients are suitable for the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new kind of human flow that has been influenced by the media jump. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl plates again and now feel forced to buy back their old albums.
"On the basis of my conversations, people had usually abandoned their collections in places in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain certain ages of vinyl arsenic buum.
And then what about the alleged emotional meaning of sound records?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, they realize that they provide a comforting community for the same people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly offended by the uncontacted payment system.
The digital world may alarm some of the vinyl fans to whom returning to familiar disc boxes means lasting and reminding young people of the days of happiness.
"I think it sometimes fills a hole or material property for some sort of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so many others too.
It's an easy way to get your thoughts elsewhere."
"We're like social workers!" Wez's coworker tricked behind the board.
The ICM study in April revealed that nearly 50% of the buyers of the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their record.
The study also stated that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of the buyers of a vinyl disc do not have their own record player at all.
At this point of the news broadcast, I'd probably look like a serious face while it's a little bit of a bossa nova collection.
The new appearance of vinyl plates is also associated with the "pocal phenomenon" observed by the Sounds of the Universe (as customers at the moment three middle-aged men) seller Jonny, 42.
"When a client recently came to the store and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it on his shelves," Jonny says.
"The share of such customers is not large, but they still exist.
For them materialism is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell me they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting hobby."
The customer is much more varied in the Fopp, where I arrive next. The business has owned a whole layer of vinyl plates.
There are seventeen pairs, photographic tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is delighted, although the atmosphere is not as relaxing as in previous movements: loudspeaking instead of swinging jazz will be the most recent synthesizer pop of Wild Beasts sex.
None of the clients look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a melting psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppi for a few minutes and looked at different discs in the discount.
He's more looking than shopping.
He tells me that his results are small, so it's not possible for him to collect records.
"They're paying a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the vinyl is ...", he lets the enchanted ghost and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a number of teenage girls who think they're sneaking out of jeans, but who, instead, are gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and a daughter who were thinking about buying a Crosley recorder.
On the left is a staircase filled with the wall of Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key plates for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just a decoration element and part so high that they can't even be lifted.
They're pure Art Vinyl.
But given that all the means to get attention to these discs may mean more money to the industry and send a few customers to the hacker to Soho, there is hardly any reason to complain.
It is not surprising that a population with the highest probability of more time and money than most people have, at the same time, the group that spends the most money on luxurys, such as vinyl plates.
Although the results of YouGov are true on the basis of my studies, at least in Soho's disc shops, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both disc stores and online forums.
These people are likely close to school or work.
They certainly won't spend their Thursday mornings in Berwick Street's disc shops, browse records, and avoid TV runners who stare scaryly and look at unforgettable middle-aged men.
The Holker, or ice shark, is the longest living spine — a video report
According to scientists, the longest spine in the world is a ice shark.
According to Shark Researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark forever was obtained in the study for 272 to 512 years. It was a female of five metres long.
The French Court rejected the application for the closure of the jungle camp
The French court has rejected Calais's application, which calls for tens of temporary shops and restaurants to be dismantled by thousands of refugees living in jungle camps.
In the course of this week's legal proceedings, the Calais authorities submitted claims that the State should be allowed to dismantle the 72 temporary trades established in refugee camps, which sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks to the refugee camp residents and offer haircuts.
According to Calais' prefecture authorities, these shops and restaurants must be unloaded because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, because free meals provided by the state-supported organization and other bodies are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary stores and restaurants often offer protection and free food for those who need them.
The Court of Justice ruled that 72 temporary traders had no legal basis for banning, but considered Calais's prefectious concerns "completely comprehensible".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the food shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp have a much greater importance than simply offering food to people who " live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under the threat of decommissioning was the Jungle Book Kids café of the camp, which is unwilling to win and offers 200 meals per day, hours in English and French and asylum counselling for hundreds of unaccompanied minors of the camp, whose status is most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address where children's cafeteria is required to keep.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, closing it would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
On Friday, two charitable organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate that, after the sharp increase in the number of fires in summer, the population of jungle camps has risen to more than 9 000 people.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU average
In Finland, food is very cheap for consumers to be happy and harmful to producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly 5% in Finland in three years, with a price drop by 0.9% on average in the EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have declined to the second most in Finland in EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
Only in Britain has the price of food declined faster than in Finland.
The information appears from the article of Statistics Finland's Development Manager, Ilkka Lehtisen, published in the Information & Trends Blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed your turn, after which food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the price is pressed by Russia's bans on food imports, which have blocked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in a short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decline.
Large trading chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been seen as prominent advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the stimulus of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU countries in Finland with the same wage level as Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT percentage, Finland would sell the third cheapest food from similar countries.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were in seven tax countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT should be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continued price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations made by him with the VAT percentage are directional.
The school isn't all the same.
A returning person to the school bench may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is a guide for all Finnish schools to operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of handwriting is abandoned, and instead, in schools, coding is started.
Sweden's education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and societal lessons are already read by four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how you try to make schooling more interesting.
The longest spine in the world was found - ice sharks can live for up to 400 years
Even known as ice sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches genus maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spine in the modern world.
In the animal, it is only a Icelandic mushroom whose oldest known individual has been dated for the age of 507.
Green sharks are floating along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Women stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres.
As the growth rate is slow, monitoring shows only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks of 28 females who had remained in fishermen's catches.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiocarbon limitation of lenses.
For at least 272 years, the mean life of the reefs studied was shown.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimetres of amazonian population, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only achieve genus maturity over four metres, researchers have calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann's fired for almost 300 people, they won't reduce sales.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of the negotiations is a reduction of about 300 jobs, most of which are in the form of redundancies", says Stockmann.
According to it, the number of merchants in stores is not reduced so that the customer service is not affected.
In addition, some 80 support workers are offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's core negotiations concern about 3,000 employees.
At their start, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction is intended to reduce the annual cost of around EUR 20 million, which is expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve EUR 50 million savings this year.
In the background, Stockmann's difficulties to get profitable from the merchandise store.
Although the Group's adjusted business performance improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the merchandise trade continues to lose.
According to Stockmann's CEO Lauri Veijalainen, the sales in stores have not exceeded the objectives set by the company.
"Personal reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive business performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen notes in the newsletter.
In particular, the success of the Lindex clothing chain was reflected in the second quarter’s performance improvement.
The chain achieved its best turnover and results in the second quarter of all times.
Lindex’s operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, at the corresponding time, the entire Stockmann Group's operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's Group's turnover will decrease last year.
The corrected business result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north - temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland holds the weather on a sad Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also rainbows in the middle of the earth, but the south is more rainy.
The temperature is no longer very high in summer, as mercury is below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, they stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes a strange explanation for the coach’s trick of doping scandal
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as a country team athlete in the doping test.
The news office AP told me that an athlete who tried to perform Anzrah is a star of 800 meters, Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya’s country team, told me that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample in Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to the Anzrah authorities.
So it was said that Anzrah was sent home because he " committed his crime against the Kenyan country team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," Kip Keino, President of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, in turn, would send the news office to Reuters.
The Olympics are starting on Friday, and Rotich is supposed to run at the time.
It is not yet known whether there are any consequences for the runner.
Rotich was placed last year at the World Championships for a fourth time and has pre-winning Rio favors.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan general sports team, in turn, claimed that Anzrah was traveling with an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal," the source told.
Where's everybody?
Rion's general sports stadium blew its void
Where's everybody?
At least they're not watching the Rio Olympic Stadium.
On Friday, a fight for the medals of general sports began in Rio, but the world’s top solos were allowed to present their skills to a disconcertingly empty viewer.
On Friday, the organisers of Rio told us that only 58 per cent of the flags of the first day of the morning and 65 per cent of the flags of the evening.
The other one was four years ago in London, where the stadium pulled out the charming people.
Final tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
Rion’s spectator’s squad of the Olympics has drawn attention before the general sports.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches on rugby, melodas and horseback riding.
When the Brazilian medal wishes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, there was only 70% full of it.
After the Brazilian double, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12,000 people were still full of about 30%.
At least the bad course explains that Brazil, in economic difficulties, is far away from European and Asian Kisturists, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get pulled into the football stadium.
The mediator Mario Andrada told us this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"Remains 1.1 million to be sold," Andrada said Reuters.
A total of 8.5 million tickets from the Olympics in London were sold by 8.2 million, although almost half of them were more expensive than in Rio.
In Rio, the price of tickets has changed from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
In London's Olympic volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last moment.
However, in Rio, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolmen in countries with less known species, such as golf and rugby.
In the stadium of Rio, there were plenty of empty spaces in the morning.
Even the beach ball in Copacaba's sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There's enough people in the newspapers.
A new way to protect the environment - get a right to land
The Helsinki Foundation contributes to nature conservation by the latest means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant habitats.
After that, private individuals, businesses and entities may redeem property rights with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lap.
The area has been virtually divided into blocks that willing to acquire withholding rights against payment.
The holder shall be entitled to 187 square square blocks of a veto, which means, in practice, that no approval is required by each holder if the purpose of the land is to change.
Holder rights can also be acquired in several blocks.
Acquisition of administrative power is something concrete that can be left inherited or gifted.
No need to go to carry bandrolls or chains themselves somewhere to protect the environment", explains Juha Leviakangas, who has acquired the right to control its company.
The person who has acquired the right of administration receives accurate location information in his block, allowing, for example, a visit at the block.
On the Foundation's websites, the names of the holders of copyrights appear on the same map where the land block information can be found.
The Leviakangas sees its acquisition of nature as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way inequality or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The fundamental idea of the Helsinki Foundation Holder project is to protect natural areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either through purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to enter Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki trade fair on 13-19 August.
Cycling thieves are pissing out the biggest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality
Cycling thieves are most plagued by the major cities of Finland in Turkey.
This year, more wheels have been stolen from the number of inhabitants than in the other nine largest cities.
On the basis of the wheel thieves reported to the police, Helsinki’s News explained the extent to which in the ten largest towns of January to August this year stolen bicycles and parts of bicycles are calculated as a thousand per capita.
In addition to the Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, four to five wheel thieves per thousand people were carried out.
On the other hand, only about two wheel thieves per thousand people were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In these cities there is a double number of thieves in relation to the number of inhabitants," described the police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board.
The police of Turku are wondering why the city is at the comparison site.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The generality of the reserves can be influenced by the amount of wheels in the city and how much wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Määs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, expects Turkey, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of wheel thieves is largely based on the study and cycling cities.
There is a close center, short distances and a lot of wheels available to thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where the city centers are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary mobility tool," Reen says.
In all Finland, there has been slightly less wheel stealing in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the declining trend in recent years, the police are getting a little more than 20,000 wheel thiefs every year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, because only one part of the victims tells the police of theft.
Reen urges people to report a crime report on bike theft, although fewer than every tenth case reported to the police.
Typical of theft of the bike is the one where the police get information about the thief immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be solved during other investigations when, for example, in the drug case, stolen wheels can be found in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, wheel thieves are caught every week for their own work or in connection with the police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from commercial centres' wheels, indoors, warehouses and bicycle cellars, which is practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
The most individual bike models are stolen like Jopo's in the past years.
The U lock gives the bike a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves, for example, take a bike for their own short-term use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on sale via the internet, for example.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not noticed that stolen wheels would go hardly abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, stolen wheel buyers are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful because he may be guilty of a hidden crime or a hidden crime.
Reen says, "The evaporators should call if a good-purpose bike is sold at a very low price.
Special libraries officer Severi Hirvi wears his colorful Nopsans for his working day to the protectors of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but no one has been stolen, says Hirvi. "Nothing has ever been taken, there has been a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there is not necessarily a hipster value," the Helsingie Hirvi thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was quickly set up in the Kiosk in Helsinki, locked his bicycle on a small U lock.
Now the bike sneaked the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike in something fixed, such as the wheel drive.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsingfors student about his white bike, whose frame alone paid about five hundred euros.
"How much time do you hear from friends that the wheels have been taken?"
Mostly bad wheels, such punk yopos.
A bike was stolen from the houseyard a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve could wait for it.
People under 15 years of age responsible for their crimes?
Helsingfors experiments with the U.S. jurys
In Helsinki, the so-called jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal circuit.
Initially, the experiment will be applied to people under 15 who are now without criminal responsibility.
The Comparative Judgment intervenes in the first young person's crime.
The idea is that the jury will discuss with the perpetrator of the crime and impose the penalty.
A week later, the offender himself can join the jury to compensate for his deeds.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Action, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargaining bargain
"Everything leads young people into a more responsible direction so that not everything is ruined by the first mistake," says the Institute.
A model from the United States has been introduced to the Comparative Jury, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, a young person will not be confronted with an adult panel but reflect on what has happened about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, the service design agency followed by the experiment, says that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It has been a message that you will continue on the road you have chosen," Lovio says.
The Comparative Jury is part of the Immigrant Youths Helsinki project, which is underpinned by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all in need, not just to immigrants.
More than 70 Republican opponents want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter requesting the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. magazine Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his ignorance, incompetence and record disproportion, threaten to bring a sound belt to the democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only direct allocation of all possible funds to the Congress elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorative anchor in their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections will be reduced every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is apparently the republican Andrew Weinstein, who is opposed to Trum.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "humans who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and is not in favour of anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, which are believed to have injured millions of voters.
Furthermore, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief to American families of children
In the United States, the Presidential candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be President so that the US economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
In the middle of Clinton's plan, there is a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve the US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The building programme is a hand-sharing programme for American dunes who suffer from the transition of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme as the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a building nation, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the role of working children’s families.
On Thursday, he heard from Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to the tax tax, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he supported before.
"As President, I am opposed to all trade agreements that operate against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it "supply only these kinds of millionaires".
Trumpi's proposal for a reduction in corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's porehole".
On Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America a big one again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton pictioned.
These are Rion's audience numbers: The races have not glued Finnishs to the screens, but the mobile application is interesting
Usually, the sports competitions are seen in television viewers’ statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached high numbers of viewers.
At the same time, the races have climbed 12 per cent of the population to the top of the screens: on Tuesday night, the Yle Olympic Channel followed 615 000 viewers.
For a comparison: the EM competitions in general sport a month ago received nearly 800 000 viewers at TV2 at a time, and the EM competitions in football fairly second million.
To date, most of the Olympic species have been interested in cycling Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, which both reached almost half a million visitors at the Olympic channel at a time.
The senior sports manager, Panu Pokkinen, is satisfied with the spectators' numbers and reminds us that the spectators will for the first time be divided into several different instruments in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns are following the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers at all choose the Olympics.
Even on TV, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports contest for which Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are viewers throughout that time from 20 000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London competitions or in the 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference explains the difference in time - a large proportion of Rio race broadcasts will be in Finland at night.
The second reason for their negligible interest - if someone now considers it to be negligible - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise medal from the first races, the interest would have fallen upwards with it.
In addition, public sports are just starting, as are other Finnish interested species: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkise, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When the general sport begins, the audience numbers will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for races, which rose in the first days of the races in Apple's App Store as the most downloaded app for free in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been loaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already on the way for 200 000 downloads.
"We'll only get the audience numbers later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users hopefully.
Pokinnen says feedback has come and the defects have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delay and other small technical problems in the early stage.
Applications have updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympics of Rio will be seen on the Yle channels and arena more extensively than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can monitor some species, and the Yle Speech broadcasts races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be seen both on the Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to the official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, with a depth of 95.3 metres on the Cross.
It may be even deeper.
Technological diving trainer Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters in Crosssel, with a depth of 104 metres in the base of the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to in vain strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method does not necessarily find a small deepening at 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
Thus, the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvaswatersi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres range from Saima, Toisvesi and the Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Day.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately identified.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kanela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Day will not reach the ten deepest and Suvasvesi is even further away from the top.
Corrigendum 12 August at 14.29: The last corrected song, in which the deepest lakes of medium depth were wrong.
Iman's tax law: More stringent taxation of pensioners
The taxation of pensioners continues to be more intense than the taxation of employees.
The idol says that there was a mismatch under the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
This is not part of the government's proposal.
We believe that this should be absolutely the case.
The promises given should be maintained after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, income reductions were made for employees, which reduced taxation.
It warmed up the opposition’s representatives in the parliament, who swept the minister of finance Alexander Stubb (coc.) from the election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it doesn't grow
In the direction of tax reductions presented by the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.), I would like to say that it is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because the wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (Centre) and Orpo's wishes to respect the competitive agreement that has been achieved.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the strength of the social partners, so it should not be disturbed by questioning.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much in the face of domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Long-term unemployment in rice
The idol appeals to the government to deal with long-term unemployment in a budgetary controversy, at least to stop its growth.
Long-term unemployed were around 17,000 more in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective is to escape from the increase in employment rates to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: Not known for Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died in bombings of Finnish time.
The Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the guidelines of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists to withdraw their journey because of explosions in Thailand, but the ambassade's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In Thailand very few Finnish people
According to Westphalia, there are currently very few Finnish people in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel period is scheduled for year-on-year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finnish people in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target in particular the Finnish people in Hua Hin to obtain information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are away from the city at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be okay, Westphale says.
No data on the factor
According to Westphalher, there's no information yet about the attacker.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and to the constitution of a military junk last week's referendum.
The law was adopted by a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who reported their opposition to the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, Westphala says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, hits in the past have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today's a big, local celebration in Bangkok, Westphale says.
According to him, the city celebrates Queen's birthday and mother's day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
These attacks affect the day's course so that the authorities are very accurate on safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotase" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, reports the Thai police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
At the tourist destination of Finland, the holiday island Phuket at night exploded four bombs, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not demand deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded on Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
In the popular tourist destination in Hua Hini, according to the local authorities, four bombs have been blown up yesterday and today.
At least one of the two double bomb hits died.
In addition, in South Thailand, the village of Surat Than and the town of Trang exploded at least one bomb.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, because it transportes Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
Fighter not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, leader of the Thai military train, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are trying to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't let people panic more, he said to the journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told the Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place at tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finnish people to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas, as well as to follow the guidelines of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnishs to withdraw their journey to Thailand because of explosions, but the instructions of the embassy should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
In vulnerable Europeans
The attacks and victims that have occurred during Finland's night are known to date very little.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been allowed to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the vulnerable there are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded at the nearest end of the known watch tower.
Thai PBS tells me that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where they believe they have found another bomb.
Sad Than's bomb was hidden in the flower bench, according to the governor of the province.
At the strike, the local employee died.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that the Surat Than attack also used two bombs that exploded about half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won women's triumph
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second with 60.098 points and the Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for championships in Rio's races with perma, jump and tree.
Biles has mastered women's gymnastics to a degree in the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from three predecessors.
He has won the quadruple and permano championships three times in a row and a tree last and second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two team championships.
Biles have a better MM medals. They've got a jump and a tree.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Island has no effect on tourism"
The Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket and a child play club in the same property, has not been concerned about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, I do not believe that there will be anything more wonderable about this, estimates Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen many tragedies that have been experienced in Thailand near.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these former people have not banned tourists, this is hardly the same.
Huovila's office is located a few hundred metres from the explosion site.
Huovila heard a hit from his own employee.
The worker called around 9:00 a.m. local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the roads had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's party in Thailand.
Patong had a peaceful atmosphere and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10:00 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many hadn't even heard of the attacks.
Half a day in Thailand's time Patong had normalized traffic and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
On the basis of the strike site, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila, who went to the strike site, says.
Later this car was seen in the Kruunupy at Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was fired.
The patrol detected two men suitable for sensing marks hidden in a close cube.
Another man was caught right away.
The other one ran away, but later he was found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank the clues.
Research Director on Russia's Changes: Clear Removal
On Friday, the highest leadership change was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diploma, acting as Ivanov's second man.
The Canvasbreak says that the reason why Ivanov was dismissed may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way to prevent people from inheriting independent power from the president.
According to the canvas, it is also possible that Ivanov has been confused or misled with other leaders.
Position loss in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin, is moving to specific environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape by the state media, Putin said the change to a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace persecution,” Russia Today said.
The canvasbreak says that from the point of view of Ivanov it is a clear loss of position.
Environment and transport are not very important in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but the president was Dmitri Medvedev.
The canvas burst points out that the old map, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Older scientist Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Political Institute says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his neighborhood to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to Jarabulus city, so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabou.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the important city of Manbij.
However, it was estimated that tens of Jihadites were left in town then.
Corrected previous news at 19:30: Previously, we mistakenly told us that civilians were running out of town, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled out of town.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's documentary publication is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's guidance on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Vooti says to the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authorities' own guidelines, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to the Minister of the Interior to the evening-Sanoma.
The Minister justified the decision by means of instructions from the State Council Office and by the fact that the data had been recorded in the minister's calendar rather than in accounting material.
The head of the Ministry of Communications tells STT that the need to reform practices has been noticed at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt’s last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has been running against time under the championships.
From the beginning, he insulted his backwards and had to skip Jamaica’s Olympic bands.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better condition.
I've practiced well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - dressed sabbath dancers and fans.
Around Porina Bolt, the Jamaican star has risen in the time when the general sport has fought with the doping scandals and the sparkling interest.
Bolt’s previous loss in the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was exploded in the first 200 meters in the time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose exercise attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his prevalence began at a hundred meters, breaking the world record and the final celebration of competitors at 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career at the time of the legal point.
The world records born in Berlin are still in force at 9.58 feet (100 feet) and 19.19 times (200 feet) respectively.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is looking for 200 meters of world record and 19 seconds of understatement, but no one but Bolt himself believes in it.
At 100 Bolt, the most challenging is the 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin in Athens in 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing MM final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred centimeters.
Bolt hasn't lost any time in the final of the championships in Beijing, if it's only possible.
In Daego 2011 a hundred MM finals left Bolt without running because of the misleading departure.
Bolt will fill up over a week in 30.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's World Championships in London for the last goal line of the career.
These are the Olympics who fire me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm underneath, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Revelations from Rio: two athletes are suspected of a doping crime
According to the Chinese State News Office Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
A Chinese swimmer from Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was sent to your home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epohormone.
He was located in Rio for the fourth time in a butterfly swamp of 100 metres.
According to the Brazilian magazine Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case before the International Court of Appeal of Sport CAS.
Xinhua tells me that Xiny's sample on Sunday had found signs of hydrochlorothiazide diuretic.
There have also been other doping suspects in Rio.
BBC news that the Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epohormone.
Kenya, in turn, has sent home a general sports coach from Rio because of a doping crime.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK told us that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete at the test stage and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media data, this is Kenyan fast run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the Ferguson Rotich race pass 800 meters in the situation.
The puppy doesn't stop any of the historical gold came into the style of the show
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, was swimming in a 200-metre segment of his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the Olympic Gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' victory time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was placed in the sequencing second before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC's Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs at the evening interview.
Helen Skelton (Ok.) on Monday is the most read on the Iltalehd website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small amount in some or the British press of his revealing and special housing.
Television is a visual media, he's pressing.
Skelton has been dressed with high-tended shoes and a short dress, which certainly has at least enough visibility - in the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back-steps to be allowed.
It's important to look good, and the little squirrels are just funny.
I'm sure Skelton wants to swing, and maybe to use it as a matter of urgency, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're looking at sports here, and we're gonna have to have a phocus to be athletic.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the cavity has gone up to Finland?
I can't, but all that's paying attention to how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they do is ok to me, Skelton swells.
You know what?
It's an aggression from nowhere if it comes from dressing (drinker).
I'm a little fun if this thing's hit someone's radar.

The Argentine lady strained the Beaver-Siren - the Finnish thought of protest
Wind Better-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Beater-Siren got tough on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady swept the Wind Beaver-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening day of women's surfing.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the crime.
He was stuck for the crash, and the others fled, Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
For a long time, the athlete considered a protest.
Then it was not worth doing it because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water so I could have gotten the compensation, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hanged on his board until the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, the Finn left at his 27th departure.
In the overall situation in London, the 2012 Olympichopeathalist is the eighth.
The calamity of the disease was not much affected.
Friday is an important day when we have a race for 10-12.
Edited 0.39: By way of the first knowledge, Beater-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, increase the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into the life of a person.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of the person so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that can not be affected by the person himself can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to mid-body acidity or to a social position.
Regular shopping can increase the age.
You don't even have to sneak up all the time. It's enough to get me a milk coffin.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest results of the research.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Beer and coffee drinks
Coffee drinks have been found to protect from some nuts, type 2 diabetes, and from Alzheimer and Parkinson disease.
Research at Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the "reduced risk of death", especially in the case of neurologists or cardiac diseases.
Again, research on alcohol suggests that reasonable use - from one dose to three days - could extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental wire can extend the life of a person for up to six years, says a study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
They can also contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The study in Norway explored the impact of laughing on human life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more dizzy than 35% more likely to be alive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexual diseases has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order to get additional years of his life, he should also get an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings additional years, it is not disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute cellularity.
For one research at Oxford University found that women with a large back had lower levels of cholesterol.
Their body also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study associated these factors with the mortality of the matt lamb.
Whether an athlete or Oscar won the Olympic medalists, he is more likely to live longer than a regular bottle.
Many researchers have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life for additional years.
Some researchers still suspect that long age is due to a person's social status, which, for example, makes it possible to seek confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
The study of shopping behaviour for people over 65 years of age found that a daily shopping person was likely to be less older than a purchaser.
This is due to the fact that operating in concrete trades reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may premature death.
So count your credit card from your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A deadly drunk ride pulled to the truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car sneaker happened at Koskea.
The accident occurred at Koske, Koskentien and Sorvastontien mid-Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that had received had driven on the same road, hitting the truck in the right corner.
After the collision, the truck stayed on the band, but burned.
The driver managed to turn the fire off himself.
The passenger car broke down the dike and then the door over the roof.
The woman born in 1972, who cared a passenger car, was left in pressure in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Central Hospital in Turku.
The result of a woman's blowing test was 2,02 percent.
He's suspected of a rough drunken ride.
The mail sent me some loose candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the K-Citymarket's free-success range, because the mail had accidentally delivered a part of the load to the Wall River.
The Teija Halt, who lives in the property, was buying loose candy from the Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign was hit in the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the loose parts because Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So, if you don't break in the lawn cut, the sign was in the sign.
The plate of the shop is linked to the fact that the Posti expanded its services last spring to also apply to lawn cutting.
Grass cutting is always available by Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly fun and he decided to share it in the social media.
I was hit by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Mr Haltia wonders.
On Friday night Haltia's update had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the Post Company Transport Services, regretted the damage to the evening-Sanoma.
The background is that three of the five scenes diverted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we no longer left to make part delivery (Saloon) at three, but we only took five scenes today, Kaidesoja told the evening-Sanoma.
It was the first news of the Night News.
Teija Halt was not angry with the sign because he found all of his own free candy favorites in the selection.

In spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds. Let's do it now with the project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he would finally want to get to normal weight, which was a journey of ten pounds.
During three months of exercise, five pounds were finally dropped.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in London: the memory of the victim for the police dogs
A week ago, the family of 42-year-old women murdered in London hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for the use of police dog work.
The Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update that conveys the family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had done his work as a replacement for Sipoo by the Veterinary Department and also carried out his nurse training there.
The veterinarian station remembers the words that touch a woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and unintimidated work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovian woman was murdered in her own garden in Loviisa Koskenkyl.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was very pet-loved.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a flour.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no connection.
There was a police dog Börje involved in the tracking of the murderer, who was injured in a situation of arrest at risk of death.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Justice issued a judgment to Post on infringement of the Equality Act
Post had no right to arrest the salary of the employee who refused to know the renter, assessed the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The Court of Justice imposed Post on the employee to pay most of the wages and €2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested the informant's salary for only a part that accounted for the part of the acquaintance of the entire day's work.
According to the Court of Justice, the employee had been placed in a more disadvantaged position, in violation of the Equality Act, on the basis of his trade union activity.
The worker had complied with the PAU decision on the prohibition of access to information.
During the November Postal Bill last year, PAU made a decision that Post's employees are not familiar with the offenders of the strike.
First of all, the news of the People.
Returning Turkey to a way that respects human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and human rights-respective development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in reply to the Journalistial Federation.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its earlier letter Sipila and Soin, the Journalist Union asked to express its concern for Turkey's freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini have repeatedly pointed out the importance of press and freedom of speech to Turkey.
Putin resigned the chief of his administration with Estonian persecution
The Russian president Vladimir Putin has dismissed the presidential head Sergei Ivanov, Kreml says.
The nephew of Karl Vaino, the Communist Director of the Council of Estonia, Anton Vaino.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news office reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kreml Bulletin, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inside, will move to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace persecution, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spying.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but I became President of Dmitri Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 prior to the re-election of Putin in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant purchase for a gambling ban - not seen in the opening of the Valioliga
The world recordman of football movements is not seen in the field when the English Valioliiga is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed with him to England.
Manchester United's giant purchase Paul Pogba is on the page because of the game ban when ManU opens his league against Bournemouth on Sunday,” said BBC on Friday.
According to the UK media, ManU paid the Italian carrier from Pogba to Juventus EUR 105 million.
However, the United Kingdom Football Association FA keeps him away from the game, because Pogballe remained a burden on Juventus.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it becomes a game ban for one game.
That ban on gambling has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is on the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is the virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival's position as an internationally appreciated event by the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival begins in Helsinki on Friday.
Typically, festivists have expressed themselves by dressing themselves.
One of the main artists of the stage is this year the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stabilized by artificial grass and art installation.
For us, it has never been enough that there would be just a main stage and a bargain, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Helsinki Suvilahde, has grown from a small card-lifestar to a tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the perpetrators themselves want to go to?
It's pretty abnormal to think this way in the production of events.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act according to official regulations, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end of this year.
The aim was to raise the number of visitors of 70,000 in the last year with 5,000.
Even this year, there are a number of interesting national and foreign artists at the festivals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because we need to finance things in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a flock of cattle controlled in huge corridors.
That's what we don't want.
Over the past 13 years, the successful event has led to an ideology that includes 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars in part of the artificial grass area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller slaves, 15,000 people are active as a playground this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be more simple.
Maybe I'm a little mad, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't ours anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to Kallio is that even today great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the 21st century, activities were very dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki for around EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow's operating company was approximately EUR 6 million.
It's a way to create "circles of things," like the construction of that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves by dressing themselves.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to be separated in the first place by content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of punk, 69 years old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rapper and soul-combining festival to be the most typical performer.
According to Kallio, Iggy was bobbed because now is probably the last time we see this in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what they call on a commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is fucking good and he's been doing damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower boxes. The tourists fled in horror.
In Hua Hin, local time was blown up on Thursday night by two bombs.
At least one local woman died and over 20 injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in the flower box and blown up with mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as the tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, said the police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia since 1989, told us a much - speaking picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the game properly, you can look at it here.
Of the injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb was blown up at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time was blown up by two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded persons is not yet known.
Very soon after this, the popularity of the Finnish people on Phuket Island exploded two bombs.
No one knowingly died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was taken in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, in Trang City, one bomb exploded.
The police told me they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin that had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, it may also have criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been seized by criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new force will start fighting in a war situation
In an acute situation of war, warfare officers are only ordered after several months to fight for the swearing of a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnise, for example, 5.5 months of crew serving in a military situation, only those who are in the final stage of their training will be able to fight.
According to the Head of Education, reserves are first assigned to the preparedness forces.
None of the shipowners or reservoirs are ordered for a mission that has not received the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces are starting to train crews to the immediate capacity units from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during the training of the crew.
Pamela Tola got giant replacements from the home house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a severe dispute in the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trading price of the two-separation was EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, there was a serious problem of moisture in the house, which caused a dangerous growth in microbial life to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in decommissioning condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss of EUR 198 000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple brought the case to court and called for a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court.
The Court of Justice issued a judgment on Wednesday.
It maintained a court judgment ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47,344 for the trial and settlement costs of the couple.
The right to reasonably lower prices slightly because some of the housing repair needs had already been known to buyers when making the housing trade.
However, according to court law, the construction errors were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for good homes because they did not want to do repairs.
He had the idea that the building was basically repaired and in good condition and that there was no harm to the elements mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned as risks and malfunctions of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters flowing along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that it was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma left the idea that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be controlled slightly within a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013, the building identified microbial growth, according to the Witnesses, due to both rock rainwater and capillaryly rising landscape.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes was estimated by the inspector to also enter the interiors through the glacier.
The health risk-possible, limit values of swamp or swab was found in the house care room, the cellar staircase, the living room window separator and the cellar wash room.
The terraces were built without permission
The Court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the city of Espoo's decision to make changes to the apartment prior to trading.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
Home problems were, however, a key issue in the court.
According to court law, the buyers could, on the basis of the information they received before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need in the near future for measuring repairs.
Tola and Waroma considered the court had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The purchasers have not failed to comply with their obligations, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Horrible archive: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children in the Nazis - also in the Finnish register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article Dagens Nyheter how microfilm documents are stored in the National Archives of the United States of Maryland, covering a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, as a Nazi bride at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-German Race Agency.
Heinrich Himmler was the SS Director of the Racial Agency.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to get children until he had studied a SS doctor.
The same applies to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate this issue.
The Race Agency investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in women's tribal tree.
Women should also be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give handwritten lifetimes to the Race Agency, as well as good recommendations from their closes.
The Race Agency wanted to ensure that women were "children-loved", "savings" and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not allowed to marry SS men.
The case does not tell how happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lifeborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that each SS husband should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lifeborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; the pages of the American Holocaust Museum are published.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for the acquisition of children.
The German mother’s tribute was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between the "arians" and the "non-arians" were prohibited by law, the museum pages are stated.
Betrayal Sire's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed third of the sailing at the first start of the Finnjolls day at the Rio Olympics, but remained as a peak of the whole crowd at the second departure of the day.
After five departures, the Nirkko rose in the overall situation, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14.
Wind Beaver-Siren fought the RS:X day in the departures of 17 and three places.
In the overall situation, the Beater-Siren is sixth.
In class 470 Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are at 19th place.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleeping sleep, "I was so cocky"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the Risteilyl ship to the 1995 tango kunka, Finland's best sold solo artist, and the star of dance scenes and festivals, the Sillanhead is still able to pork and is at the moment in a gorgeous height.
Mari Koppise’s book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana on the life of a favourite singer was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells us about his life and career in both good and bad.
He won the crown of the tango king in the Wandäjoki Tango market in 1995.
At the race Sillanhead sang tans, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In 1995 in spring, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed for Sillanpää a man's request for a tango piece that Kassu Halonen fits in a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpää sang it to the tape in a terrible claw and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so cocky!
The bridge's in the book.
You can't imagine that it's singed in a crap right now.
Although I wasn't physically on my best, the trace was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand yourself perfect and peak.
Another man’s most popular song accident, which is reported in the book, occurred almost 20 years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from his partner at the time and the case ended in the final texts of the gold song, which was published single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sara Snakes were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanhead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the song that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the news of the 7 - day magazine.
In the news of Jar and his ex-beloved divorce, Jar was told about the excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said it was a full pussy, and it was not true.
Jari called the record when he was angry and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it... and good so.
In June the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of the voters supported the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, even though the polling week's opinions predicted the opposite.
The British economic and economic institutions were almost unanimously in the position to remain in the EU.
No acclaimed research institute or university was flagged for the separation, although a couple of individual researchers proved to disagree with the power of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign of Bill Clinton, former President of the United States, "It's the economy, stupid" flew to the Rompoop in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when they didn't hear their voice.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic Kihara
In his latest monthly question, Centre for Macroeconomics will provide responses from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economics were not listened because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economics for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed persons, which is almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also believe that the declining value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because economic unanimity was insufficient.
In particular, the fairness of the BBC, which gave just a few per cent of space to economic scientists representing the EU's economic disparity, as did the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling what opinion IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power books are about the consequences of the difference.
These far-reaching literary combinations talked facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if economists were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
Academies such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrants take your job, the immigrants rush your hospital, the immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments are a mess.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical time if they weren't?
Every school also has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the real British children be able to get out of school?
There are foreigners in every municipality.
How much more space would the first-age people have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and if they did, their answers were not visible.
The economists failed to explain that the UK has more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and especially European immigrants - are net public finances in the UK and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans for A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in the event that the result would be leave, the plan B, i.e. the win of the EU-funded camp, began to be more detailed.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid resources, but they could now be necessary.
We left to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid funds, Olden says Aberdeen's only open daily on a noteable basis of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to the old one, the normal rate would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds, Olden says all UK real estate funds open.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 per cent or even below it.
Thus, the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-funded camp won, Europe went confused.
However, the few two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Olderman.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, where he considered that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, freeze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to the years 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more peaceful, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to rotate, and the fund was forced to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash collected, but it was ultimately forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old one, they did not actually close trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the notification.
After that, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very peaceful for a couple of weeks, Olden says.
He points out that, for example, Aberdeen's Manner European Funds have not had any similar strain.
However, there were many questions.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old view was that the closure of real estate funds trade was disproportionate.
Open funds, which were closed, dominate about four per cent of the UK’s real estate.
Aberdeen's closure took six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Openiva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold up its fund for 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have fallen downwards, but the situation for Aberdeen does not seem to be "more fragile".
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, says Olderman.
The dollar and pound price is weakest for 30 years, and the market has a 15% discount on the Brexit vote period.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Olden says.
Brexit brought some reductions to the London real estate market
At 2:00 a.m. the situation didn't look so weird yet.
But at four hours when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the keyword.
I realized that this is going to plan B now, old man says in his other home in Helsinki.
He went to work right now.
London City was already alive in the morning.
The TV screens normally kept silent at the office would support the news, and usually loud people were completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera in the morning to tell me about their divorce.
When the market opened, the display ends shine out of red.
It was the morning that would never have believed to be alive, old man says.
Not because, despite the storm, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in the UK, finalised two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. as a robbery.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was kind of peaceful, Older says.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by the storm.
The red collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate heavy bills on the UK and, in particular, London real estate markets.
Up to 20% reductions were anticipated in London's office premises in the coming years.
Soon a group of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the dough has fallen down, but in the air there is still uncertainty.
It does not, however, appear to be the last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on the face of the Old One.
He still thinks it is far too early to say much about what Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of London's real estate markets has already received initial information.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, says Oldman.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and in only five months there have been worse figures, says Olden.
All the equal drops reached the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the US real estate market with the global economic crisis.
The old believes that the comparison is not quite correct, because it is now a British crisis.
There's another atmosphere, too.
The real estate market has now not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Olden.
We'll find money normally, too.
The repair business could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a miracle of him, that could have been before him without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world first towns have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, Olden says.
So the drop started very high.
London's prices have shrinked up for four reasons, Old List.
The British economy has grown sharply, and the population in London has also grown.
The second major trend is that the properties are the last ownership class that globalizes, Olden says.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination identified as a city.
In addition, prices have been raised at a low rate of interest, which has led, for example, to the need for pension companies to look for profits from new destinations.
The loan has been readily available on this - although the old has now been used much less than in the period before the crisis in 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price rises settled last summer, Olden says.
Aberdeen also started to reduce his property in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it came.
What's going on from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Olden.
He doesn't dare to assess much, but he says that there's hardly anything to say.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even way ahead.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down, since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he's an optimist who believes that the holes will be survived by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much victim.
If it's decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Olden says.
Group S starts registering shopping information more detailed than before
The S Group soon knows what you eat, because today the trade group told me to start collecting more detailed information about the purchases of its parent customers.
Once information has so far been collected from the final amount of the invoice, the group begins to extract it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S group follows here Kesko, because the data purchased by a plus-sagar card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to Ismo Riitala, K-Plus Ltd’s CEO, the feedback from the programme was mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the customer's consent and are used for marketing with permission.
The most effective channel is an e-mail.
A fairly few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to the House.
He says that Kesko is not going to react to the S-group registration change.
Kesko already ranks its parent customers in ten groups according to just food shops.
Classifications shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified by number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a parent client program and does not have any such program planned for this item.
Finland's Near Trade has its own 1st-bonus customer program, which can be associated with in Valintal, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We are not currently collecting information on product or product group levels, we remain at the final level of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and I do the day, as well as the client's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level of K or S, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
He said that the stock client programme would continue to be reformed, but the Near trade will be informed later.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of product information to be reduced.
First of all, experiment
SOK's customer and customer register has so far been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data included also the profession, education, housing, childbirth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The S card purchase has been deposited on the date and time of purchase, location, total purchases and payment method.
In addition, the S-bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismois, Kodin Terroes and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at the product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely, says SOK's client owner and partner business manager Marjaana Saarikoski.
S Group says he's informing his clients about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing.
However, the data is stored on the boxes in any case, wanted it or not.
The willing person can check the stored information on the S Group website.
For example, the bags do not have access to the information, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppet is Customs' latest dog enhancement - the puppet becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labradorian puppie snuffs five similar boxes in the row of countries at Helsinki Airport.
It won't go far when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila playing it with that favorite toy.
From the box next to Heila, a bottle of scented hulls were revealed.
Ruth gas is the first smell that Heila has now practiced, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online access
Heila is the first dog specialised in the search for weapons and explosives in Tull and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Work tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing sites and ports, as well.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures in Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Customs Superintendent.
The second access to the training of a gun and explosive dog to the duties of Customs is posting through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail shipments are carried annually through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the customs duty at Helsinki Airport has made a discovery of some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, including the purchases, luggage and air cargo of online machines.
Heila will work across Helsinki-Vantaat.
It's going to look into registered luggage and mail.
Its ports will be a great benefit in the future when it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is very hopeful about the idea.
School in Church Number
The training of Heila-pennun is coordinated by Tull's dog school located at Kirkkonumm.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and in defence expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
The hospital will always be further trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the six drug dogs of Tull and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labradorian Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The criteria for selecting a dog that complains of the airport include ribbon and hunting suite, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close working mate for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nothing without Heila to get home, Suntio laughs.
Fine orders go to Heila from the one-stop ladder.
The evening messaging cameraman will lose a camera miki's protection to a fast dog, but Heila will return a soft toy's protection immediately from the "remove" command.
Heavy competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, assessing whether training is sufficient for the required tasks.
Heila can be seen at work at Helsinki Airport next year half, if everything goes according to the plans.
Sadly, passengers can't come to slice the work bars on a dog, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog for customs duties is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, and then they are retired for care of their owners.
The working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active employment rates can only last from ten minutes to two hours.
As the owner of working dogs, there is a tough competition in Customs.
As the owner of Heila, about 20-30 employees were applied for by Tull.
Happiness hit Suntion, who hasn't had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance tasks at Customs.
The Mini State received its first Olympic medal, and the people will have a day off.
Fewer than a million inhabitants of the Fiji Olympic Gold in rugby are so highly appreciated that the government has appointed the 22nd August National Day.
According to the terrestrial broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the matter after the championship had been resolved.
The day of the day of the team's day will be held on the day after the team's return.
There are also celebrities in their country of origin for the sanctuary.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was followed by a final in the capital of Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only the Nazis of Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants the game was watched, I heard them encourage, said the Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish swinger fainted after a gorgeous performance
The pressman Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight of 175 pounds.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the riots, he has been dizzy many times.
No one's been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 pounds from the push and 145 pounds from the temptation.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 pounds, as did one another.
In the third company, the weights were raised by the scratch.
The body trembled under the weights until the court accepted the lifting.
The Finnish buyer's joy was expressed by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS purchased an Estonian attacker Prosan - Wraith League - Night Messages
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting contract with the Estonian attacker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for a leading player in our team who has works and whose threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over ten players.
Little silence from the crowd began to be distinguished as a good option Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen told in the newsletter.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, a depositary, where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemeeters meet the dominant Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became a need for a new attacker when last season's painter King Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family Star again: Teen Star Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, a friend of Alex Dunphyna of the Modern Family comedy series, will explode again by presenting his threatening body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in Minishorts, which do not leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also this back.
Recently, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by transforming its style and use into much more courageous.
The star has posed in the pictures she has published in the social media in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing very tight housing.
Winter on the threshold of adulthood has recently also published several pictures of itself.
If you can't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Previously this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV Amy Palmer doubted that Winter was in the process of having a "typical Hollywood form change" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more look at the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series, only 11 years old.
The actor has threw some of his long-term fans into his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where she will be in ten years when downhill is already so hard now, says a woman in Winter's Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women's fans defend the actress and urge them not to care about criticism.
You look great!
It doesn't matter what the others say.
You're an inspiration for many women, a tiny young woman.
Japaners prefer to go to Finland - tourists are attracted by renovation: In autumn it is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start renovation in the beginning, says Visit Finland in the newsletter.
The main destinations for Japanese renovation are Inari and Levi.
The renovation fires are our winter travel cards, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snow landscapes.
Lapland’s winter renovation flights have a high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the renovation season begins from early autumn and continues far to spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the reverse fires making the vision twice a coincidence, reports Visit Finland’s CEO Anne Lind.
The main target group of the Visit Finland renovation campaign is wealthy women aged 25-35, and Japanese women living in the city, dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, through online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights in Finland, and this renovation line has a huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays for Japanese travellers have increased significantly more in other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than double than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland as a target group for tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
Brittany had to be satisfied with silver in the rugby-7 race when Fidz's championship bag won gold
The impressive success of the United Kingdom in the seven rugby races broke awkwardly when Fidzi won it in the finals played at the Rion Deodoro Stadium on Thursday at the 43-7.
Fidzi gave the master's teaching in ball processing, transfers, sidesharings, support games, running lines and raw lines, and thus won gold — if it was the first Olympic medal of his entire history.
The killing meant silver, which was a little smaller than the comfort for Britain, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success in the first rugby-7 tournament in the Olympic Games, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The rigorous victory from the Boks of South Africa in the 7-5 semi-final earlier the same day could have adversely affected the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fidz team in this form would have won the British even though the 15-person team would have been in full power.
To Britain, it may be comforting that tomorrow at least one British gets a gold medal: the main coach of Fidz Ben Ryan, the former coach of the German rugby-7 team from Wimbledon.
The experience has been pretty good for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament at Ryan's training.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Killing hurts, but progress is awkward.
Fidzi started excellently and presented his background skills to the United Kingdom for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams were hit by a bunch of buses, and the world champions rose to 5 to 0 when Osea Kolinisau crashed in the corner.
When it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai made the second goal to the right, put a goal shot.
The 12-0 situation, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's wonderful tavern prevented the gorgeous Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it did not slow the way Fidz went for long.
When the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made a goal in the right corner, then Britain was 17–0 in the loss.
Nakarawa made a second goal for the further start, when the first half-time game was over a minute left.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the more impotent tactiles of the British team and crashed over the finish line.
After the target hit, the opening period ended 29–0.
It seemed that the Fidji have been born to play seven players' rugby, while the British are still in the class in the role of the apprentice.
What's so much true.
In the mid-term, the United Kingdom made extensive changes and managed to hold the whole of Fidji for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half-time until Josua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team game of Fidji.
Dan Norton managed to reduce the situation by making the United Kingdom to the left corner of the goal, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans in the viewing room sang, whispered tickets and danced.
Fidz’s purely joyful attitude was hard to ignore.
Mata Viliame made a final note to the Fidji cake by making a painting in the last moments.
The rock ringed, the Fidji embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely broken.
Previously on the day, Fidzi had won the Japan semi-final in the 20-5 years and the UK had slowed down past South Africa in a tight semi-final where the equal situation resolved the UK's goal shot.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's Box to leadership in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his fabulous footwork and fell under the finishes in the second half of the time.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson, the 15 player of the rugby team, sealed the victory and finally the silver game.
Coach’s fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to roam gold
Gold could not be more emotional in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning played 220 wins in history and found additional purposes for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were in the airs, the third coach Robin Williams voice was echoed on the boat, which encouraged them to the second consecutive Olympic Gold in two women, making them the first women in the history of British sports, who are acknowledging the same achievement.
Their superiority was undisputed, their victory was already 39 consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two great athletes connecting on the water surface as swans age, does not entirely correspond to the nature of success.
There are a large number of helping hands behind each of the rodent golds, each of which has taken two per cent of the achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who then did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said that the situation at that time was tight.
"I had urinary bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut away.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It's changing a little bit of a way of thinking."
Williams got a diagnosis in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the seasonal season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if now in such circumstances can even say.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It worked as a incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
It's a journey to roam itself, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more normal when trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Shooting Clash, who was behind the Afghanistan tour, says: "I have been ruined this week at an emotional level, which may be a little extreme, but that means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years in Helen's and Robin's casino have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so crazy thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm that their competitors have failed to draw comparisons.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover had additional resources.
"We were very close in a moment.
Helen picked up "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drive away from the route."
"We succeeded in leaving well, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We didn't strive for the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good move and win the race we did."
The twin's thinking a year before he decides on his future.
Glover's celebrating next month with Steve Backshall.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland exchanges the government of Panama's leaks
In October, Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which are called for by the excitement of Panama's information leaks already in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians have evaded taxes through tax paradises.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the minds.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analyses, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s last spring anger affects the election result of autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear degree of criticism of the rulers, and God Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S. Republicans, revoked his last swings.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of Isis and the Democrat candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was upset with speeches and asked for apology from Trump.
As Chief of the Army, you should never let anyone go down like this, Clinton's chat.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a cover-up burkini-sweeping dress by Muslims, says British Guardian, among others.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that all those who do not have a good practice and a secular bathing suit are prohibited to go to the beaches and to swim.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of disturbances in order in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July 85 people died and hundreds of them were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to celebrate the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists who were connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulun area passed through the screen in the lake of the dish
Water samples taken from official bathing sites in the ova region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only the Pyykösjärvi beach has been observed with bluetongue.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public coasts.
With the exception of the seaside, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and intestinal enterocococic bacteria were below the operating limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococ in the seaweed bathing area were established on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations were lower than the operating limits.
The blue-leavened seam at the seaside of the lake does not yet make water unreasonable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-leavened flower, making the water surface of blue-green leavened boards.
Environmental action follows the situation with intensified checks.
If the bluetongue turns into bluetongue, this is also reported separately on the bathing area notification table.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkaraine of Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 % of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one tax change in the next year's budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance.
The income levy proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of a gift tax for generational change in forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a forest grant reduction has four objectives: to promote generation change in forest holdings, to younger forest owners' age structure, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of the forestry sector.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool to promote generation change in forest holdings is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Manager of the Agricultural and Forestry Producers Central Union (MTK).
However, the hacker finds critical in the tax change statement.
A forest gift reduction is presented for the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
The MTK and Hakkaraise believe that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could directly result in the sales income of the wood.
The VM's proposal is based on the fact that a reduction in the pure capital income of the forest economy prevents the loss of the capital income of the forest economy, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would have a tax advantage, even if no tree was sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to characterize it, Hakkarinen says.
In addition, he said that the model concerned only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit imposed on the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled up too high for Hakkaraise.
In such a way, he believes that 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are removed from the area of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners' community, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the limit ensures the aim of increasing the volume.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been brought to Hakkaraise for decades.
Its background is the ageing of the forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of forest owners are retired.
The powerful crawler surprised the drivers at Himanga, two cars sneaked out and hit each other.
There was a special trail in Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutively run cars were cut off in the fence, after which the rearing came after.
According to a friend's firemaster Harri Pyyhti, the demolition is suspected to be due to a strong rocket wall.
There were two people in the car that was driven back to the hospital.
There's no more information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometers to Kalajo.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results by researchers at Turku University can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings of the akademic professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissues, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by returning the cancer-based tissue to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of medicines for cancer may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in treatment.
Research results have been published on 4 August in the rated Nature Communications magazine in the field of cellubiology.
The tree of the family home sun continues in the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The tree of the family home sun continues in court with respect to both convicts.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family homes in Muhokse.
One received 8 months of murder and brutal robbery as a young person, among other things.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and brutal robbery as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced to a serious threat to road safety as a young person and to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The judgement of the Court of Justice was complained by the prosecutor, the shareholders and the man who received a harder judgment.
The Attorney-General calls for a lesser sentence to be convicted of the murder of a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
At the time of action, they were in full understanding
According to court law, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked in July last year as director of the Child Protection Unit.
The 17-year-old of the murder sentence, according to the reasoning of the judgment, attacked the director sitting on the living room couch.
The director had been able to get rid of the extraction and put a young person in his room, when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The conductor was also strangled, beaten and kicked into the head, among other things.
According to the state of mind, at the time of the act, both convicts were fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the day before.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, growing only at the age of 156
As the world's longest living spine, a verified ice shark has been found, reports the research published in the Science magazine.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark or holker can live up to 400 years old.
The female increases only at the age of 156.
I've been stuck for a lifetime. It only grows a centimeter per year.
Only one species of mushroom is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
The scientists found out the age with a radiocarbon limitation.
As a result of nuclear experiments in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
They made it possible for researchers to assess the age of the sharks.
Forever, 392 years were estimated, although the throw in the direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenues would be missed if the change in corporate tax made by Donald Trump was carried out.
Tax revenues were also reduced, particularly as a result of the most profitable tax relief.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
I don't think it would be a huge sum, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39.6, after the reduction made by Trump 33.
You'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump blamed the State for overregulating the business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards adopted for emergencies must be re-established and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's health reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is the main cause of US problems.
The free trade agreements would be dismissed.
For imports from China, a penalty rate of 45% and 35% would be imposed on Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our religion, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control seas, American steel to lift new clouds across the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - even those close to the Republicans - are seeing the Trump programme bring the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday, Finland's time.
The wave of attack from the past - People's News
The sea is devastating, but the real wave of attack is hit in the middle of Madrid's streets. The account with the past can begin.
It merged the core of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's news.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travellers (2013) was a little fun and scrupulous satirical comedy, the pre-season skin where I live (2011) at the tops of my Spanish career.
Even Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is a harmonious love, relationship and family drama with a relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is a spark and we'll be seen as a long back.
Life seems to be a model for the middle age name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can always be wondered to the end of the movie.
In the form of a backdrop and a long letter, Julieta once the stages of her life for her adult daughter.
He begins from time before the daughter's birth, from the moments when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, a young teacher of Julieta, is rising to the other female main part, a TV-accounted series of Ommelte time (2013-2014).
The ageing of Julieta has been dealt with in a way that can be seen as a kitchen, but I would say that it's a bit scrupulously and verbally with a single wipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance from Julieta to the unique humor.
It is a fairly playful, controlled, place containing good music and a rather sad movie with elements for elegance.
Instead, the typical visual color aperture for the Spanish director is maintained and it begins to inject in a little quiet eye more as a pure shape aspect than as a dramatic means of action.
There are diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses of the film, but the surface remains one Korean.
This applies in particular to dressing: in the case of a name person, the dwellings vary from seizure to seizure, and the same applies to apparent replacements.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the swings of each scene, does not improve this more specifically.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has made the manuscript of literature based on three novels by the Canadian Alice Munro awarded Nobel in 2013.
The Novels have been published in the Work of the Escape: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a little equate literary filming.
The essence would have been emotionally undeniable to even more drastic, the great things - especially the clay guilt - are dealing with the thematics of the movie.
Guide and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Mainly Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's first night is 12 August.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts are being made, the sparkling ministers, so that the Finnish basics are not completely collapsed.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out as a robbery.
There will be no new surgery.
The already decided four billion savings are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) are convincing under the budgetary constraints.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the World Cup proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's supplement, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of the unemployment benefit is reduced by 500 days to 400.
Training surgery is continuing.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
Why are ministers so squeezingly stressing that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipalities will be held in April and they are the most important fever meter during the parliamentary term, not the gallows.
It has already been seen that the various communal results of government parties will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallups say that the Finnish government party expects a smoke loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest compared to the parliamentary elections 12.3 per cent.
The Basic Finns received 752 new delegates four years ago, many of which will be realized in the next spring by the price of the influence of the right government.
The life of the government of about three of the same large parties is dependent on the enduring of the Finnish base.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters of the party have already been tired of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's membership have also come to the surface.
Firstly, the rethoria of the new cuts will not obscure the fact that next year it will be done roughly and secondly, it will be attempted to soften the anticipated attack on the Finnish people.
Large cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything is probably different if the government of Sipila is still standing.
The government has set the goal of indebtedness during this parliamentary period, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take € 5.9 billion next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the town halls, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt will not be tightened or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This means new even more severe cuts on the previous ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be spent at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring it will receive what is going on in Parliament elections.
Indebtedness of these actions
It is absolutely clear that the current actions are not going to be indebted, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to blow up a positive atmosphere.
The curricula presented by the State Secretary Martti Hetemäen's budget consciously testify to it unwarrantedly:
The global economy's growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimal, i.e. no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen recently since the collapse of 2008 except in the period of the revitalisation policy that took place temporarily at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been extended by an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current public debt flows, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
The indebtedness imposed by the Left Union in spring 2015 was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will practically be covered by a completely new debt.
This is the understanding of the center, the assembly and the basic Finnishs of what is responsible.
Question: People want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three of the four believes that the organization of day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the research of the KAKS Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people will also be responsible for the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civil schools, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The province's responsibility is more clearly sought by county guarantee, specialised health care, vocational education, higher education and institutional care for disabled people in development.
There is no wish to delegate any of the tasks of the municipalities under the responsibility of order.
The underage drunk runs out of the achterdistance after the police escaped.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist ran a police patrol away in Joensu on Friday night at half a time.
The police team tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to run the police at a fair speed.
The back-up continued to the Sonkajan Coast, from which the Sorronahon and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After this, the young man ran away from the run, but the faster-footed police ran away from the escaper.
The driver's blowing test showed 0.75 percent.
He also had no driver's license which would have allowed him to drive on a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock barn fell down in the dike.
The lorry in the rockbar fell in the lake of Polvi on the Cavation on Thursday night at 9.15 p.m.
The truck had drove out of the road on the left wing and fell on its side.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver from the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first nurses.
The vehicle was taken up by the owner of the car.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil was absorbed by the rescue facility.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Old woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in the Lahden Village in the South of the North.
The police are looking for about 165 centimeters of a woman with white hair underneath the jaw.
The findings and indications of the missing movements are requested to call the Centre’s point of reference 0295440513.
Materials of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery about the destruction of Parafest
The crash flow of the Parafest festival tents caused massive destruction.
The President of the Joensuu Parafest Association Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival will be financially accessible, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared at the end of Friday night on the marketplace.
On Saturday, the programme will continue at 1 p.m. at the premises of the city theatre.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15 a.m.
The programme will be organized as planned.
The pulse flow occurs in the cloud when the rainwater and its weight start the downstream air flow.
Changes in the conditions of the Ucco Cloud water bind heat and thus the lower air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
It is reported from the Institute that crash flows occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of pulse flows.
The pulse flow hit the Joeensuu Museum of Art in the backyard on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four persons were slightly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for further treatment.
Air pollution obsessing Londoners
According to the study, London's skin is getting older faster than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The UK research reports on Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retired Londoners’ skin is two and a half years older than that of a rural fellow.
Small particles older than the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, where almost 9,500 Londoners die every year according to Evening Standard.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their work trips near the bushed streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleansing.
The tractor's brakes betrayed the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his garden with a tractor.
When he had risen out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor’s brakes were deceived and the tractor swept on the man.
However, the man did not fall under it, but the tractor was pushing the man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital to further investigations seriously injured.
The tractor had no time to go beyond the light, because it struck the stones ahead.
Nothing in the New Powers for the Future Period
Liga-Riento, who plays at the Flyball Championship, will start with a series of better starting points than men's memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.

Through Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. Country Team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all the MM games in the gym since 2003.
Now, the sixth race is going in Tampere, only in 2013 failed to be better in the North American quarries after Canada was better.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was setting up a salibandy country team.
I was interested and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York in Elizabeth City.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen got to Joensu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensu, that kind of species was not yet played at SM level like a salibandy.
The band was played at the university.
I played basketball in the Kataja and later in the Jokiboys in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played in the company of the University in the SM series of salibandy in the period 1991-92, the following three went through in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the company's A girls for the championship.
Women's SM series career grew up to silver in 1995.
Overall Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, a total of 169 matches 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasu circle closes to Kouvola - SM-gold missing from awards
As a beach volley player, Essi Hasu is about to quit after at least a temporary period.
Beach volley The Finnish championships will be decided at the Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in the series of both adults and young people.
In collaboration with the SM final tournament organised by the Kouvola Flyballers and the Finnish Flyball Association, the six best pairs of each series of rankings will be awarded.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's raised by Essi Hasu, who has been among the beach volley summits in Finland for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully, as many as possible will be able to get to the lobby this weekend.
I'm sure we're coming to the laundry stadium as a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu feels.
Kouvola's area burned Hasu's rock into sports and gave a good meal for a great hobby.
It's a good thing to remember about childhood.
When I was 9 years old, I started a ball in the E-girls of Elimeen NMKY.
The main thing in mind is a too big game shirt, spinning knee guards in the necks, as well as great ass screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports career was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the work of the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasi beach volley was already a junior species choice for indoor ball.
On the shore of the river, songs have already been played in the 1990s.
It's always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Anniina Parkkise, a SM-finals.
The goal of the second sentenced twin in the tournament is clear after the Riikka Lehtose and Taru Lahti.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-bear we still lack from the prize dog, Hasu throws ridiculously.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasu's acquainted audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil society are awaiting.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
By the way, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Salomon Koli courageously became a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk takings, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started shortly two years ago, together with her little brother, Valentine Kol, as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Mark Koli, helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant indebtedness and an increase in the volume so that bread could be handed out of agriculture.
This has been my thing since the little boy.
I've always been happy in the farm, and now that I started myself as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a garden water, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it.
However, I myself really bravely joined the project and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells and adds that if he had not believed in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even larger cars.
The work has produced results, because Solomon Koli has been selected for the top ten in the competition of the young food producer in the Rural Future magazine.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21 August.

The anime effect of Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was an anime, but some observers think it's racist.
With the Snapchat lens platform, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are ungorgeous, distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All the miscarriages will quickly become publicly aware.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized where it has been accused of the popularity of blackface-may or whitened skin tones as a beauty glance.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into nuts, flawed teeth and made the cheeks bottles, some of the critics called it racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The judges also wondered whether these repeated contradictions would indicate the greater problem that the company has with the differentiation.
The news and anger spread to a large extent on Wednesday, and it was written about the web releases The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat told me that he had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended to honor the anime characters, not the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of insulting stereotypes.
Some strongly challenged the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets of pictures were widely distributed, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the equivalence of an extremely unpleasant Asian caricature with the filter efficiency.
It shows that the filter is not only "yellowface", but is carried to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle about diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we transport with us.
The great audience of Snapchat is made up of young people who are more diverse from ethnic backgrounds than their parents, which may mean that they are likely to expect even more fineness.
"When one of Snapchat's birds creates a picture that hurts the user, this kind of things are no longer very easy to ignore, as Katie Zhu, 25 years old, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, as Product Manager and Designer, Zhu decided to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and telephone interview published in the media, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company as a majority of white men and only men's leadership and decided to write with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no colourful people in their unilateral staff, so they can make decisions like this, or they also have colored workers, but their position is not such that they would dare to express their views directly and easily," says Zhu, Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish numbers of its staff's ethnic backgrounds, invoking its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its reporter, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underdegraded groups of people and to promote participation within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this isn't okay."
According to the Congress Expert Group, military officials distorted information about Isai
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group published a report stating that officials from the United States Armed Forces, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against the IS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground allowed us to understand.
The Heads of the Republican Committee for the Enquiry of the House of Representatives (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group in which the interim report reports on the "general discontent" of military intelligence analysts.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the U.S. military forces in Tampasa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results accepted by the senior leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism activities than the facts on the ground showed, and were exceptionally more positive than in the analysis of other intelligence services," reports the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events can't be accepted – our soldiers are suffering when the high-level political decision-makers are presented false analyses," says California Republican Commissioner Ken Calvert.
"The errors in the Central Gate extend to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems identified in 2014 and 2015, including the descriptions and analyses by Central Command of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama's administrative authorities have been falsified, it gives an analytical picture of the idea that the leaders of Centcom would have pressured them to express a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and statements given to the Congress were much more positive than the actual events," says the report.
"For example, Centcom's official issued a public statement that a major military cruise to take Mosul back could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, which is the second largest city in Iraq, is still under IS’s control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says the Republican Minister of Kansas in Mike Pompeo in the press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the U.S. forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to mitigate the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after having been informed of the doubts expressed by analysts that intelligence information on the Iss would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday is followed by more detailed results, as studies continue to be carried out.
In addition, the Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an investigation into the intelligence of Centcom.
On Thursday, the democratic committee responsible for the enquiry of the House of Representatives published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
" Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a too limited process to evaluate intelligence for the security forces of Iceland and Iraq," says Adam B. Schiff, the High Representative of the Committee.
According to the ship, this process " delayed the publication of the intelligence results, violated the morality of analytics" and "insufficiently noted different views".
However, according to the ship and the democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to press the analysts of Centcom to adapt its conclusions to the "predetermined or political" official line.
Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the study carried out by Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times told us about the Pentagon Superinspector's investigation, which was initiated following Centcom's analytics claims.
The Pentagon reporter, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in the press that the Department of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is in progress.
However, he says: "Informers sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has further consequences, in addition to its efforts to determine whether the bombings led by the United States in Iraq and Syria have been successful (more than one claim from the defence authority).
However, the claims put forward last year made it possible for President Obama to rely on the Central Command and to give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of information on fathers corresponds to the differences that emerged over a decade ago when the intelligence analyst of Centcom Gregory Hooker published a study that the government of President George W. Bush, despite the opposition of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time to consider what would result from the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the revolt of intelligence about the Fathers.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Working Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the expressions in Isis' controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and thus had been able to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted to Central Command, reports The Times in September.
At the time, the Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had assessed the statements of witnesses given to the Senate as too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced Central Command commander General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth duplication of women's ground hockey and strengthens their position in intermediary investigation with Britain
After making three goals in the winner, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. won India.
Five goals in two games could be regarded as a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who like the number of paints they make."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share their group first place with Britain, which continued to win their win tube on Thursday with Japan's 2–0 figures.
The UK and the United States will play in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final match, which determines which of them is the first of the six blocks of the team and which of them the second.
The first one avoids encountering a longer time with a hard-handed Dutch team that won the second block.
Notwithstanding what happens on Saturday, the Americans have already raised the peak of their surprising success in these races, four years after the last 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was in the team, too, in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the Pennsylvania state and for the first time took into the ground hockey box only at the age of 3 (she's parents played species in Drexel). He joined the country team at the age of 16 and thus was the youngest country team player ever.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he did not survive the final list of players.
Afterwards, the 2012 races, in which he and his team were hardly seen successes.
Next year, an English coach was appointed Craig Parnham, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our mission in London was not as it is now.
We have made a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the painting account in the first half of the time, hitting the ball close by a rush.
India had come to the game without any tournament win, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept the 1–0 situation up to the third episode when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, sneaked to the middle field, hit the ball to the finish and thus brought the Americans to the 2–0 leadership.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first of the tournament, where the United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the American goal had been hit by each one.
Briggs is now living in his lifetime of success,
And Bam.
"Our investment is good now," Parnham says, but how good, it depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympia Hallina, my trampoline brings zen
No matter where and no time, the Olympics must be confronted.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next thrilling message continually and everywhere.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is a flaming messenger that moves from a sniper to a swimmer, a swimmer to a gymnast and a triathlonist.
You can't open the television, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the cafe line, not only about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time in the Olympics, Dooley's charming smile and might well have a name on all the lips that would appear and be part of the best time to watch and listen, would be popular with sponsors and would appear in good mind television advertising if he was just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a sword.
But Dooley, 28, from California Lake Forest, competes for Olympic gold with trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Far away from the center, partly in the shadow are less known sports types, such as air gunshots, flex shoots, ball balls and taekwondo.
We'll always have a brush, and let the championship stay for us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favor, I would like to draw attention to the temptation of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic species.
Innocence can be regional.
The United States has certainly participated in the Olympic Trampolis, but the country has never come to the medals and has not progressed to the finals until 2012.
In men’s trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and women’s side to the medal are the two Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan defend this year the gold medals they won in London.
Trampolin, however, has the attraction of the defendant, partly because in an uncivilized ear it sounds more appropriate to a circus school than to the Olympics.
(I acknowledge in this context that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species have a comic potential that has been used in drawing movies for continuous booming scenes of characters, but it also has the same dignity as sports and swimming jumps, i.e. species that are essentially united in trampoline.
The word trampolín comes from the Spanish word or trampolín, which means "ponnahdusplate".
The ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline, which crawls them up to almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as rounds, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flying time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The direction of the most common Olympic species is straight forward.
With the aim of gold, the medal needs to reach further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the target line, sometimes backwards around the field.
In addition to the world wall or the wall of departure, they also have another goal in television-oriented reporters, namely the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is luxurious, admirable, even fanatic — and it is even enough to get a viewer to tears.
But I also think this is a little tired just when we look at the races.
This trampoline offers a breathing break.
In Trampoliin, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast climbs up without weight like an astronaut, falls down and sings up the trouble back up.
Of course, the species also includes a competitive aspect, and it is not easy, but it does not have to do with an intense run on the finish or jump far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as you can only get to the Olympics.
Women's matches and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and start at 1 p.m. local time and men will match the races on Saturday to the same time.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon mission, which begins on both days at 2 p.m. local time.
In the middle of the Olympiamania, a peaceful and lovely moment could be overlooked in the midst of the public hull.
And if it is only possible to raise awareness by offering attractive male athletes and materializing them – as recently suggested by the American men's men's champions in the Wall Street Journal – Logan Dooley is only waiting for his new fan crowd.
The whole generation protests in Ethiopia, a long - term US ally
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have dismantled demonstrations demanding political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, a number of demonstrators have been shot to death in contacts with the police.
Is Ethiopia going to break down?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable Western ally, whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, over the past few months, the country has been shaken by anti-governmental demonstrations that are spreading to more and more broad areas.
Just thousands of people last week ran into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was unpleasant.
According to witnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
Probably at the end of last year or the videos described at the beginning of this year show how the security forces are hitting young people who have been forced to stand on the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer now calls for thorough research.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country unified and to move forward even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Head of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. Army and intelligence service are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, will receive such much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Abeba is even a new urban train.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still far from the model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have continually reported on government policies of repression, the opposition in the country is very limited and the dissidents are swiftly impaired.
Many people have been expelled from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far away into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are oppressed, and they have no other option than to show their mind, it gets out," says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer of the University in Central Ethiopia.
"A lot of young people show their minds.
The whole generation is protesting."
There are many subjects of discontent, from land use to government coalition discipline.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the party and its allies got the last place to belong to the opposition, which means that they now rule the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrean border, where the worsening situation required hundreds of deaths in the fight in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Border or the Ogaden Liberation Border, may strive to exploit confusion and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitterness of the atmosphere under the surface of years is decaying right now.
The first is apparently innocent: smartphones.
Only for the last few years have Ethiopians been able to communicate in social media when cheaper smartphones became more common and internet access improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people can access the Internet through mediators who hide their place of residence.
Many Ethiopian youths told me that they called people for demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of Ethiopians, the Oroms and the Amharans.
Anxiety and amhara are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amhars from Ethiopia, mainly from Christian Highlands, have ruled the country’s politics and business and have taken away oroms, most of which are Muslims and are living in the suburbs.
But this is also changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, anxiety leader.
The biggest demonstrations have been just in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many amharas and anxieties experience that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the tribe of the Tiger, which represents only about six percent of the population and, however, rules the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former Director of Rebellion Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius that could see behind the corner.
According to the analytics, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of discontent and to use ambassadors who compromised the counterparts.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desaleg, entered Meles' boots from almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles from the Tigren region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to the analytics, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the tiger tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
For the last time, similar noises were experienced in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against the elections that the government, according to the analyses, first drove and then stole.
Many protesters were killed in post-election unrests, although the dead were less than in previous months, and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for remote infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant progress towards combating poverty.
But the inner horror of the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from becoming stronger.
And greed is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in Gondar, Amhar City, the protesters attacked companies owned by the tigers, and the rage speech against the tigers is becoming widespread in the social media.
According to the analysis, the protests put the United States and the other Western allies in a bad situation.
The U.S. Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unoccupied, neighbouring Somalian aircraft, but the U.S. has recently closed the base.
At the same time, while the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its formerly unstable ally to collapse.
"This requires a rigorous balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isis.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to withdraw his words in his last campaign, claiming that he was not serious when he said several times this week President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders of the Isis terrorist group”.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he might not mean.
Trump made the statement during the election on Wednesday night and repeated in different interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton had created Isis.
However, on Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump made his full talk on the twiit from the previous day, when I said in several interviews he was serious about his accusations.
When the radio runner and Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpi soften his claim by saying that Obama is trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw from his claim.
The last storm of criticism rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back to the economy as the support figures declined.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and felt Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretches the limits of political speech and withdraws its words if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way to test certain messages that raise responses to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to the messages, and "clears" then in a way or another depending on the reactions," says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are enough round rounds to pass through different screens."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more prolonged in recent days when his support figures have continued to fall.
The new opinion study published on Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist reported that Trump’s support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida’s situation is strictly equal.
While Trump is usually trying to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
However, after getting more and more closely monitored in the last few months of their presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have placed his loyal supporters in a difficult position where they are forced to publicly defend Trump's comments, regardless of how provocative they were.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, defended the presidential candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I consider his messages justified, as a political speech," said Giuliani when he was asked whether Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded Isis.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called completely mistakenly "the lower series team" and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most of the republicans representing the power are trying to claim that the Obama government, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed Isis to continue to act when it did not deal with the situation determinedly in the Middle East.
Before Friday's elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media in Twitter, where he accused them of his speech and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He ridiculed "indecent and pathetic" television commentators who were trying to find out about him, but he said he couldn't succeed.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump's explanation, and they just said it would show more clearly that he was not fit as President.
Due to an unreasonable increase in rent, the cafe at Greenpoint stopped opening
The Verb Cafe was a bit ugly in Williamsburg, where it was only cash and where there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its street base on Bedford Avenue when the rent rose unreasonably.
Soap Cherie was replaced by Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014 and sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals consider that this is under the middle classification to avoid the loss of a café.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB club is no longer, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the old one, it also creates new ones.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a fair mile north of its original place.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unfinished.
Even coffee is still good.
The owner and head of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb order bagels from the same journalist as before and use the same espressocone model.
In addition, it re-initiated even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, he wanted to try something new and
added to the list of new products.
There are bacon egg cheese sandwiches and full of capricus and browned onions.
There's also darker beads on the list.
The café no longer gets beer, but juices made of fresh fruit.
After holding the cafe nine months Rodriguez says he noticed that old standard customers started to visit Verb as a steady flow.
"As well as many of our old customers got priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira who went to the cafe at last Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he made a walk to Verbi, who was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he tells me he's stopped the coffee business for some time.
"I knew I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took his normal ice cup instead of a chai-tea mix, which is also a listing.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully to Verb since 2003.
He went to the cafe always before work and ordered the same without exception.
"I sat in the cafe every day in more than seven quarters, like a machine, and there they already made my voibageli with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still orders its standard products, but sometimes she varies the bagel's bacon, chicken egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hate the soap shop taking an old place.
Soap Cherie's owners even offered to make special soap for which Verb's own cold-cooked coffee is used.
"We can still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
The traditional Polish residents in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us to apply for a suitable place for his new neighbors to feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell coffee in the cafeteria.
The café may also be extended to the exit building.
However, many customers will have enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a standard client in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the café was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like coming home, says Whitt.
"I missed the fragrance of the cafeteria."
Large depression season duck food in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat on lunch in his office room in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary, was pleased with the luxurious foods of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose-maker and Maryland's turtle soup.
That day his menu was more modest: the deviled eggs of the deviled eggs in the tomato sauce, your potatoes and a dessert of bone muffin.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights works both as a food historian.
Coe's last book, called Chop Suey, tells about the Chinese kitchen in America, while the last book of Ziegelman, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the floor in Lower East Side via food.
Their new joint works are published by Harper and published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food as a great decay in the 1930s.
The couple showed its own culinary solidarity when deals with the supplier of Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron cloud designer and was opened in the same year as the big stock exchange rod, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, for his part, turkeys, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat roast, the couple said it would fit for a very large debate on eating a depression period.
"The muffins were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"The people ate peanuts, livers, and peanuts.
They were made from substances that were cheap and contradictory.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for a whole meal."
Andrew Coe's pissing off.
"It must have weighed in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the big depression years, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, worked with the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, fresh cakes were served.
The Americans had sent food to Europeans who were starving during the First World War. A Square Meal is chronic about the ways in which the people survived when suddenly they had to give up their abilities.
"This was a time when the food became a key and annoying topic for the Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One of the tribulations was a new cheap diet: according to Ziegelman, the ridiculous foods such as murmurs and potatoes became the main food, and the potatoes were called "may be a great way to use food," because the cooks could not cover the so attractive preparations with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the most important part of the American meal for years, became a sparsely used luxury.
It was experimented with strange mixtures, where the most important was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values and not even taste or even healthy kitchen rationality.
During the research for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman made the oak nuts filled with peanuts used as short-time foods.
"It was not popular at dinner table," says Coe, where
The briquema adds: "It was unreal.
The peanut butter and the oven onion don't fit together at all.
This was characteristic for many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in the newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be budget holders and respond to the challenge of making tasty snacks like the carrot cream page.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historical tastings.
Particularly tasty are reports of the reactions of the government management to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "look for cake" attitude.
At the same time he publicly praised his childhood for simple food in the iow farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and sophisticated gentleman who had become him.
"He liked the continental European kitchen, like fish and throat sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a golden dining room, with a smoking head.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to show an example in his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested at all in taste, the foods served in the White House were not only the boringest in Washington, but also the worst cooked."
Many of the depression foods were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple tells us when writing the book that she started to better understand the eating habits of the mother of Ziegelman, for example, why she couldn’t throw food away.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"The people even started to get sick for his food," says Steineman.
"For example, once the windshields."
When the main dishes had been emptyed at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the food they made at home, the same thing that President Roosevelt ate during his lunch.
"It's called a bone mundane," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a seeming name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream wax, only bones, little flour, sugar, water and candles.
We relieved our lobster with a thick brown dick.
And suddenly it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a second and a third.
"The German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, hearing from a positive budget manager.
Full compensation to Gilead for the lawyer’s fees for the patent dispute with Merck on hepatitis C
The U.S. Regional Court judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. was entitled to receive full compensation for the lawyer's fees for the disputes between the pharmaceutical manufacturer and Merck & Co Inc concerning the patent of a medicine for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from the compensation of $200 million for the infringement of two Merck patents in connection with Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni success medicines. The U.S. judge noted that Merck had committed violations of false oaths and other immoral practices.
In a complaint registered on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the United States Regional Court said that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it had incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to achieve Gilead, which controls the market with new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can be treated with over 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case runs until 2013, when Gilead and Merck brought each other to justice and demand the private ownership of sofosbuvir under the laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead’s medicines.
US-supported forces have taken over Manbij City from Isis
The U.S. forces have taken control of the city of Manjib near the border of Turkey in northern Syria, when the last extremist organisation of Isi’s fighters left the city, reports the mediator of the forces.
The Syrian Democratic Forces Group (SDF) is now shaking the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, told Reuters that the two thousand hostages abducted by Isis' fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully owned, but we are still carrying out search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent federal tax
On Friday, democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax declaration, showing that the income of his and his husbands at that time was $10.75 million and the real federal tax percentage they paid for 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organizations, most of them to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $ 5.3 million as a fee for speech, and Hillary Clinton, former Foreign Minister, announced that he earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book, which dealt with his term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine in Virginia and her wife Anne Holton published 10 years of tax returns.
The real federal tax percentage paid by them in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in his press release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
U.S. Presidential candidates have always published their tax data, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax board's inspection and they say it's why Trump hasn't published his income data.
"The transfer is yours" your double Clinton campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the democracy candidate's tax data.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Legal Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he won't let Trump disclose his tax information until the checks are done.
Trumpi’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his grants to charity, business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has tackled this question and published a video online on Friday, in which he highlights visible Republicans who patroll Trumpi to publish their tax information.
On Thursday Clinton raised this issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not to make public tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico network, Trump did not pay any taxes at all or only paid a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times Business Columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax percentages have risen as a key issue in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named by billionaire investor Warren Buffetti, which would ensure that earners of more than a million dollars per year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway multinational company located at the same place, challenged Trump's meeting, where they both would disclose their tax information.
Mr Buffet says that he has also been subject to tax control and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in the city of Chappaqua in the state of New York, paid on average 32% of the actual federal tax in 2007-2014 and the real combined tax rate they paid was about 40,5%.
Clintonie’s 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and interest returns at $ 109 000.

Chile powder-filled radio-isodondoms to support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep the elephants out of the vicinity of man’s clothing — the elephants are being beaten up by throwing up condoms filled with chilli powder against them.
The way has proved to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign aimed at teaching volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
Some time ago, some spears were used for the elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After we have developed the method, we have seen the attitudes changed in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they will be able to keep the elephants away from their fields without harming them," says the Director of the Honeyguide Foundation, Damian Bell.
First, the intrusive elephant is disturbed by showing a flashlight and playing a horn.
If this doesn't work, we throw the so-called chilipilvi.
The mixed chilli powder in the mouth is placed in a condom together with a radius, then the head of the condom is closed so that only the ignition wire remains outside.
When the ignition wire is ignited, the condom will explode openly and spread into the air a fine chili powder cloud.
Usually, one spice cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last means is the thrower who shoots in the air of the fireworks known as a Roman candle and gives rise to a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin hotel for deleting Israel's heading number from Arabic "representation" – RT News
The French film director from the root gave birth to media annoyance after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention Israel's country code number in its country list. The hotel's employee appealed to the "framework" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, expressed frustration against the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel by writing an open letter in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) magazine.
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel's guideline list of Israel.
However, it is not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it would not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate telephone centre.
The film director asked about the hotel's reception.
Lanzmann writes the answer of the reception officer that shocked him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the action was still more shocked by the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's heading number."
Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman from Israel, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said that the case was "small ashamed".
"The kill will shock and shock us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and that is precisely this hotel chain.
There's no need for more explanations.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The case caused quite a response on the web, which called it a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski hotel of simply giving up the claimed demands of Arab customers.
"Don't go away" was said in a publication showing the location of the hotel near the synagogue on the Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel has quickly contested the charges, called the past a mistake and asked Lanzmann to apologize.
"A direct order to leave Israel out of the guideline list has never been given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski, a representative of the hotel.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in the demonstration of Brazilian students
Students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to show their minds against government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators.
Mellactics began when the law enforcement authorities tried to dismantle the student force, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their shocks to government plans were involved in the demonstration.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of the State of Sao Paulo has made a proposal for a savings measure to close almost 100 public schools and invest 300 000 students in new schools.
Some of the opponents made graffits on the walls, where Michel Temer, the President, was temporarily opposed.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled with the separated President, Dilma Rousseffi, who supported the protests of the country's Senate, when he voted on the official accusation on this matter.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 % – RT Business
The annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent since the withdrawal of the sanctions, says Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagorya.
He said that the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
"Russian companies continue their existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to market.
The further expansion of trade is of course one of the priorities of inter-country cooperation," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to 856 million dollars.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent, to 697 million dollars.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The sales of machines, land vehicles and weapons were accelerated," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects the record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"The last year, the Russian Foreign Delegation in Iran granted some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time a tourist number among the first 20 countries, whose citizens travelled in Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the number of Iranian tourists traveling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotti Callum Skinner picked up the paint when the British won the gold of cycling
The Scottish Callum Skinner celebrated the reputation of the men's teamprint on Rio's velodrome last night when the British triangle defended the 2012 championship earned in London.
Glasgow 23-year-old Skinner was an anchor in his role, which he inherited from the Scottish Sir Chris Hoy of his landman. The young man made the legend proud of thanking the paint and catching the victory from the New Zealand team, which was considered pre-preferential.
The UK took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only been placed six in the London World Championships in March, despite Hoy’s leaving their competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a specialist in the role of the first player.
Hindes came out right at the right time.
Hoy's decision to terminate the competition also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man in whom the British coaches believed and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy, won the championship four years ago by Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold in duplication.
Hindes was very much behind after his round, but Kenny tried the team's leadership, which Skinner kept.
A major part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the speed at a greater rate, allowing Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy followed BBC's commentator and reached Skinner's, Kenny's and Hindes' eyes when they entered the award score.
Glasgowian 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by the likeness.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record at the final and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to crashing on the track intentionally because of a bad departure.
Later, he revoked his words and the British competitors had no complaint.
This time, there were no problems like this with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like in London, all the British tickets were lightened in the viewing room.
Our team has been united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that the victory in the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for the country that won seven out of ten boards in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress in the last five months, then the success of the velodrome is five days ahead.
As Kenny has demonstrated his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic golds in one Olympic.
This would mean an account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and also born on 23 March (as a magical date for British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
The medals would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete in the next sprint that starts today and will resolve in three days.
The Boltonian 28-year-old Kenny says, "At this moment, I can only rejoice in this.
The team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the victory with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more goldmilitas, he needs to get the value of the knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-man team drive.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The World Record, which was made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (on 22.42 p.m.) will be competed today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of the attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He had a contest with the competition journalists yesterday before the time when the journalists invited him to measure his length.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, from Milngavia, reached the world record time 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on the fact that its great road bike team will take responsibility for the middle stage of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
The expectations before Rio have been underestimated since the actual exceptional evidence received from the full leadership in Beijing and London.
The background has been dramas, of which the least is the termination of Shane Sutton, a technical director, in April, in the midst of allegations related to sex and temptation, and the end of great athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night on the velodrome show that the British already legendary reputation to rise to the top at the perfect moment will be realized once again.
The future of Portland's melting house in danger due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminum sulphur plant in the State of Victoria in Portland and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at risk when the power company supplying electricity to the sulphur plant informed that one of the owners of the plant is decommissioning the supply contract and is expected to end all supply contracts.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue the aid to keep the factory in operation.
The 20-year fixed aid expires in November.
Alcoan Portland's factory is at risk of missing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result of termination, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the melting industry consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting facility, which led to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting house loses money and is at risk of having to close its doors.
The measures are responsible for the speculation of the factory's future for years, which caused Australia's strong dollar first and recently the production price of the factory.
AGL, which delivers electricity to the large aluminium sulphur plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects three other owners of the sulphur plant to terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is the joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares from the factory.
AGL says that it expects Portland's production plant to operate permanently, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL reports that the contracts are called safeguard agreements which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months and will expire in 2017.
"This is why AGL expects the contract to generate revenue in the 2017 financial year," says the power plant.
Possible return effects on AGL from 2018 onwards are currently constraining the strong market outlook for electricity wholesale prices.
AGL already says that it has reduced the value of the contracts in its accounting accounts by $187 million "in advance of the termination of the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... capacity to maintain the melting facility in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting facility".
The American company reported that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was supposed to enter into force since November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
As a result of the weak economic situation in the sector, the analyses have been cautious for their assessments of both the melting plant in the State of Victoria in Portland and the Tomagon plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity at the annual level.
"If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant decline in demand (electricity) markets.
For us as a producer, it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashiani TV star Kendall as a cover girl in Vogue in September
Kardashian-Jenner-clan model and her mother and manager Kris' fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, is posing in the famous US Vogue in September.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and has performed in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the room that was full of my most beloved, made me tears," Kendall wrote.
The screenplay was followed by a strange (or perhaps only in accordance with the Kardashian series?), a handwritten video showing all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar disturbing Rob and Caitly and all of them, producer of the Kardashiani program Ryan Seacrest) who had forgotten his sister’s screenplay.
It's a cliché, and it's used for almost all the birthday periods (Seacrest says: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon of children's morning TV), but Kris had to bring other daughters into this public in some way.
This appearance in Vogue's September number will undoubtedly mean a new Kardashian era.
Kendal's grand sister Kim may have brought Vogue before (he appeared on Vogue's cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is his own class.
The number of September is Vogue's most sold release every year.
A large number of printbooks, more thick than a fashion account, attracts a large number of advertisers (the Fashion website calculated that last year's 832 page study had 615 pages of advertising).
The publication of the cover star in September is so intensely expected that in the last two years the images of the magazine have been leaking out in the public before the official notification.
Previously in September, cover models have been such as Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, it has been more famous for the model than for the models that are famous.
Oscar winner and Dior advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later, the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a model of success for his generation, and although he would rather be among the famous people who work in the model, he is in quite a good company.
These celebrities are not known people's relatives, real TV stars or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry above others.
Last year, Beyoncella has been behind one of the strongest years of her career when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of the real TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be hard.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadidi by calling them "smake".
These feelings have fallen back to the surface when the news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's deck came out.
However, the continued appetite of discontent seems intrinsic.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for Vogue in September.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking at Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder.
He and all his sisters are selling pictures of themselves through payable applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he was filming for the LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, she's on real TV, maybe just a way to meet her sister and her kids.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people per year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable status of countries will be removed from the legal aid centres and the sector will be prepared for the effects that additional cuts of appropriations will have on centres already at the outermost borders.
In Queensland, three of the persons seeking legal assistance and legal services are already being turned away from five people – most of them are old people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified marriages and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload has already been overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
From June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing 30 per cent more of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of Queensland's Public Legal Assistance Centre, reports that the latest calculation report prepared by the National Legal Assistance Centres is being used to turn thousands of people out of the centres every year.
If the federal government doesn't turn its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
"People who leave violent relations, people who are under an uncontrollable and rampant debt burden, separate families, unjustly dismissed workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise of bringing legal aid to the national average level.
It is now time to take account of the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was brought against a complaint about threatening a worker with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was brought against when no action was expected to be taken after it had been told to be headed that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun when driving them in Jeep in February.
The event is described in a complaint brought by Vincent Bordini, the former software trainer of the State Campaign, on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he had waited for months to deal with the situation within the campaign before he understood, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his complaint that campaign manager Earl Phillip " took out the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pie into Vincent's knees."
According to the complaint, after making a complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini heard that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Although a gun would not trigger, it would cause damage," says Bordini in his complaint.
The appeal comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused widespread anger when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second extra point" – which are considered arms owners and weaponists – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and is allowed to elect judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media distracted his words from his context and Trump did not encourage violence.
In claiming a campaign, my Border calls for compensation for indifference and compensation from Phillip for abuse, abuse and mental suffering caused by them.
Trump's reporter Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the message where he was asked to comment.
Phillip wasn't wanted, despite the attempts.
Charlotte's local news office WCCB told Phillip recently left the campaign.
No immediate response was received to the call request submitted by Phillip's consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has taken a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and in London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the thing that was most interested in Heathrow. Like at the 2012 Olympics in London, we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and all our regions benefited from it.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
Only for local communities will we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in nearby airport areas.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who think Heathrow's expansion is too challenging.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face a difficult situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always winning obstacles, but Heathrow answers every question that he asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
The enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing skills and employment to both the airport environment and the United Kingdom as a whole.
We have a great working group at Heathrow, which has implemented and maintained a 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment programme in the budget, including the T5 terminal – which has been voted for as the best airport terminal in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal built in the middle of the world's two most congestive roads.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be Heathrow's extension.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for Heathrow's expansion so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of Heathrow's Government and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising block in the cat-mice game
The attempts of online companies to mislead advertising prevention software has changed into cat-mice play, says one company producing inhibitor programs.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced on its own website that it would prevent advertising prevention programs, Adblock Plus published a blog writing where it told us that users can update their inhibitor software filters and thus again prevent community service advertising.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising label codes of its desktop site to make it more difficult for advertising prevention programs to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock tells me he's figured out the new codes.
Adblock’s reporter Ben Williams wrote in his blogwriting that "this kind of balloting between the open source advertising community and misleaders has been in progress since the invention of the advertising prevention" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair movement again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertisers have formed in the sector.
A worldwide estimate of 200 million people use advertising prevention programs, reports Pagefair and Adobe’s research last year. The number has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users daily on mobile devices, and mobile advertising is already 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to contribute to misleading advertising prevention programs in its desktop application, as the reporter says that mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop advertising remains sufficiently high, so Facebook considered the contribution to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that they will have a daily advertising tool for user settings so that users can control more how to target ads to them.
On Thursday Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, as it also prevents the viewing of some of the usual Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said Facebook's informant in the e-mail release.
"Maintensity prevention programs are tricky and ineffective, and therefore, instead, we have invested in the development of user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving herself under cars on the Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police ask for the help of witnesses on the motorway for an accident that occurred during the first hours of Thursday, in which a woman deliberately left herself under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the Vaud canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate deeds by lying on the dark road, and she was hit by more cars, says Vaud’s police in their press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her attempt was clearly to commit suicide.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many cars involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some of them are still unidentified.
Advocate Gilles Hofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneve that the criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges against the drivers involved in the accident are being brought.
"Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It will be left to the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
There have been two similar cases in the last five years which do not consider drivers responsible.
According to the newspaper, in either case, the person walked on the dark motorway and the court decided that the drivers could not expect to hit their pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police authority was released from the charge that had been brought against him from death after he had struck a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one of August nights in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and had gone out of the way.
The Court considered that the police – which was responding to the emergency call – were a legitimate driving method and that the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone who knows about the accident that happened near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASAn Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that allows the history of Venus to be explored with the same tools and algorithms as climate researchers use.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions in Venus have sometimes been similar to those on earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its gas frame is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by researchers, the slow speed of Venus is explained by its thick gas circle.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth - equivalent atmosphere, and nevertheless has slowly circulated.
The model was also used to determine the early Venus surface formation.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variations to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent lower.
"In the GISS model, Venus is running slowly and its date is almost two months per sun," says Anthony Del Genio, GISS's researcher in the press release.
This warms the surface and gives rise to rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like the umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model created the Venus story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has for several billion years been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans disappeared, and the ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
In the karate of Vedy, only a thick carbon dioxide gas frame and a fatal greenhouse effect were left in space — that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy abandons his place as a coach for Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice-chairman of the company's hockey activities, suggesting a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
The Colorado Vice President/Director General Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the company would start immediately to apply for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I've been doing my role as the principal coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the vice-chairman of the company's hockey activities with passion and determination," says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
"In the summer, I have been thinking very hard about how to improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the trainer and the Deputy Director-General for Ice-skiing activities of the company must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his stake in the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League year for his first season as a senior coach of Avalanche 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the company reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost Minnesota in the fall games and has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the period 2015-2016 and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing another Wild Card place at the Western Conference.
The Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in Montreal Canadiens rows and two in Avalanche rows.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend the strike
The main negotiators say that the wage strikes of the North Sea oil workers will be suspended when all parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil-field services, has been held with drilling cars in the North Sea, which are managed by the Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will hold several meetings throughout the day for the next few weeks, where we will address the problems of recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which, according to them, were the first for more than 25 years, as a protest against possible 30% wage cuts.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut around 9 per cent of its North Sea contractors' tariffs this year.
The company's tariff reduction is consistent with the drop in the prices of contractors working in countries by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts give it the flexibility necessary to cope with the market declining situation.
Shell, in turn, has cut thousands of employees from her pay lists and announced her plans to leave oil and gas drainage activities in up to 10 countries, thus trying to strengthen its activities after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June create pressure on energy companies.
Mr Anderson, the Scottish Member of Parliament, met working leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work crises that have occurred in the North Sea over a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that is beneficial for many and not only for few," says Anderson.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion, with approximately $7 billion being spent over the last five years.
Kepler Measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Stars
The latest task of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped the astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of the speeds of the stars of the Plejad Stars.
Based on new information, astronomers can find out why the stars of the same crowd are rotating at different speeds and how the circulators are related to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star groups we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even the history of the solar system," says Luisa Rebull, a researcher in the press release of the Caltech University's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena.
Plejadie's star team is located 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, meaning that they are just reaching their adulthood.
They're running faster than ever.
When the speed of rotation is peaking, large amounts of adult stars are dismantled from the wind of the stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of the detectable star spots (which correspond to the sun spots).
The latest listed speed data indicate that larger stars are running slower than smaller.
Rebull compares stars with dancers – larger cycles slower than smaller.
"We see Plejadi's "danse" that slowly rounds are typically larger, while the fastest rounds are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejadie Stars are so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars in proportion to the speeds of rotation.
"The Pledia star group offers a pillar of support for the theoretical models for the rotation of both young and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why the stars slow down their speed and stop their "danse".
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of Plejadie's speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the astronomical journal.
