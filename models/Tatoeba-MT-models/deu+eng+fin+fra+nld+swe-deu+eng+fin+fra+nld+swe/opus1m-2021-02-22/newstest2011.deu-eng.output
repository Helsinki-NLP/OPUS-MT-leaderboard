What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor the "conditorei".
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has a bit "cloped" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notoric snake that has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were on the roar in Prague.
The encoded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the cursed era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is dislocated from some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed something in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least they say that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a new person in Prague's politics," said Luk★ Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, on the test of the "Paten Word Shadow".
But the Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golfhole".
"This is the only expression of those you're presenting to me here that I use every time."
"Otherwise, I don't like a snake much."
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktuálně.cz in June before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial team selected six concepts, especially those that are notorically linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Maximum Prague golf hole", "Go into the conditorei", "Stiernacken", "Betrayal of the capital" and "bleaking".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school - promised his first participation in the conversation, but then didn't even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and how the Civil Democrats talk to each other, I do not judge it."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves within our programs," he spoke.
As already indicated, in the headline mentioned above, Luk★ Kaucký did not allegedly recognize that the talk is about the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he got right during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, but added to safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And funnyly, "I'll have to do a language course."
The "golfhole" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Questions Luk★ Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luk★ Plachý even knows where this figure can be found and also what it means "to go into the conditory".
"I think that is to go to any Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In line with Březina, however, he delights to have created this knowledge rather from the newspaper than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there seems to be no similar civic snake among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but apparently there is no such thing in us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use shorts or nicknames," says the Chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his partymates called "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Břza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that too," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Mr. Weinert is kind to the partymates of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by making the party sponsorships, is called "Igrek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Spoke names are the only one that allows the Social Democrats to use their own language in the internal party.
Hulínský does not seem to like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of the Gummi Binder Right" is supposed to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "hexen" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they do not find any work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"As well as young and healthy women are spared because they help work and give birth to children," a sister-in-law describes the situation in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso in a special home of more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason published a booklet to stop the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the newspaper "the Standard" on the dilemma of written information.
But to be attacked by witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men – they just overcast them with Petroleum and burned them.
This incident also reported on the BBC server.
However, the offenders claimed that the matter would have been just a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil was inflammed, which was used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "expulse a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "French women of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to dismantle the witch hunt, the Gambian President has properly mixed the President himself last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh created a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the Leibgarde of the President, violently kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the farm of the President in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
At the farm, the inked people were forced to drink a drain from plants with hallucinative effect, but also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arreted people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only due to international pressure were the almost thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant from Bakala: He heating in the oven - yet paying higher rent
An older subordinate man just leaves the customer center of the company RPG Bouy of the "kolebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new rental contracts for three dwellings: for the own and the dwellings of his daughters and sons, who just forfeit a sentence.
All three were just increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rent, the son is expected to pick up 4100 crowns next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even flowing warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal furnace," he tips with his finger on the new lease contract of the son, to whom he has a full power to sign.
"But something - I signed," he says half vote and half resigned.
The BlyOKD.cz Civil Association, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when it intends to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man's just waking down.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region becomes a large "deregulation lab".
After the new year, this deregulation is expected to be the most rented apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-friendly rents.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The RPG wardrobe in Haviov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already 9:00 in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device with her.
"Lease 2011", a special keyboard lights on the touchscreen.
Shortly suggested and the device already sprinkles out a number list.
We have hardly deciphered the number "157" and already piep it on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
A half second later, you'll be on the run.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and similar things.
From mid-November in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new rental contracts are flattering most of the 44,000 renters of the RPG portfolio in the mailboxes.
The RPG Bouy proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for new rentals in the customer center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch answer after a moment of hesitation when the "client" emerged as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a breaking theme.
Before the elections, Parliamentary Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek from Ostrava from the ČSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor of them."
"Not even ne besch. WC-brille they could change," the man mentioned in the beginning makes itself air.
Until now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rent discount that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease until December 15 will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havāov is everything else than overloaded by demands.
"From the 360 customers yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here because of," the switches estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites, as well as wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the lease parties do not agree on the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of RPG Bouy's employees, and a man on the street in front of the customer center gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13.000 (Crones) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee's gonna be insecure.
"Look at the scene."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she says to think.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic for the new year 2011 and according to RPG By, the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of RPG Bouy, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants, the owners of the housing fund believe that the main reason for the rental increase is the result.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling in front of the polsters in the waiting room of Hav.ov, there are always a few red lighting information.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Everytime this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the extremely low rent price increase of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Bouy promises that the deregulation does not push the rents jumping up, but takes place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation: all revenue from the rental increase (see chart) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation.
But - above all, these people should benefit those who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw a - in the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini children's garden, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The Architecture and Projecting Office Arch.Design, from which studios come from a whole series of famous Brno buildings, expected from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In a wiser perspective, since most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is based on the fact that the project women and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shortly, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The construction engineers have made it easier for them to take their demanding profession and care for children.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of the management they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy of CZK 2, 8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment have been acquired and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and operation.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the minikindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for an entire year, with the company Economie Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
For the children is fully qualified staff - a nurse and a nurse teacher, children can visit the nursery without age limitations, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini childgarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day varies over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexiblely tailored to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without taking into account the hierarchy of companies and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-childgarten is nevertheless comparable to the pre-school education framework.
The children are not only playing here, especially they are given excellent education - from basic knowledge to preschool education, they are also learning English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time, and so the stress of late picking up the children from a far-reaching kindergarten does not arise.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-worker relationships.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, who offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and, through such programs, strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Look at Gaudi interiors
The roof mutes on like the back of a prehistoric axe, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are shattered fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local residents the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colours, the unusual use of stones, splashes and mosaiks, the sloping facades and all present soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living creatures.
Only when you look more closely, you can see that everything is controlled by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night the entire façade works even more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colours.
The same swinging lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, curtains, ornamental elements of doors, even eyeholes and ropes.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the construction of a house from 1877, which was executed by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló rental house did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On its rearboard the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics on the façade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists were also involved in the design of the façade.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the park Güell, where other works of Antoni Gaudí are also located.
Shortly after its completion, the house was received by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism due to the "containing house".
It is also said that the sword of Saint Georg, the Patron of Catalonia, is represented right above the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique to then with ventilation channels and typical cammies.
Something bizarre already mutates their 45 degree inclination.
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations of the time and couldn't be stumbled by them.
Before the start of the construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he had given on the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so dismayed two years later at the completion that they required remedy.
The councillors were also faced with the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public staircase.
However, no further changes were made, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the request from the district in this regard, Josep Batlló submitted an application for approval of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social hall, on the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the conversion, all the right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnection of rooms.
The social part can be completely linked by opening the salons and thus a larger society could easily talk without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house was rebuilt by Gaudí in addition to a new façade, and received a rather unusual roof and two other floors.
Gaudí's game is also impressive with the light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum amount of light to all the floors of the house.
He simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colours that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in 2005 on the UNESCO World Heritage List, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor the spaciousest and most beautiful apartment is made available to the public.
The houseowners only decided to take this step in the year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly viable business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to other common and the rooftop rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for the visit of the monument is not a cardboard, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist certificates receive a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to meet the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed area - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, these must be complementary harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior in which mattress and rust are subjected.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited because they need much longer to "heat".
In addition, they are significantly more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
In fact, if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and are still on a solid plate, humidity is awesome: it is not excluded that underneath their fungus is formed.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a longer time, where very high mattresses are common with soft layers, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Why all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained with me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their cut shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I also recommend this to people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can get the "information" from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padding furniture.
That's why I had many ice hockey players, but also other customers, provided these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works very easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it sweeps straight to the warm body.
There's no way that the night, you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still count the length of the foot soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women, who are 180 cm tall, need a bed of 210 to 220 cm long.
Each sleeper should be available at least 90 cm of lay width, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on the back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms", says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the polsters and roommakers, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also presents this subject in specialized schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs a rust and his own mattress, but watch out when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains left than to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible for all bed frames.
Foaming rats should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be the shape layer and the fine paddle.
"With your hand or when you sit, you must not feel the feathers," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully padded beds with mattresses and floors such as conjugated siams have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the reference cannot be washed, which is already in progress today.
And as you lose sweat in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly become a huge (and sealed) seventh.
For this reason, professionals also reject advertising logan, which promises a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even lifelong warranty.
Each thing has its ass and but.
And therefore, a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not discourage the hygiene of the washable, deductible coatings, but it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattresses are usually made today with round-breaking lock so that after opening you get two halfs (almost important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the inequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of it!
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with fan holes (unless there are any inside) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket feathers and fine paddles.
Polyurethane materials do not belong to such a material.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (if any combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for non-adjustable lattic roasted with 14 to 18 lattic lattic latches (lamelles) and always pay for roasted lattic lattic lattic lattic latches with lordosen support in the lumbar spinal area and the possibility to regulate lattic hardness.
On adjustable lamella rust do not include mattresses with feather skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the stiffs of the feathers, special flexible shoulder modules are also provided.
This is a special attachment of the feather bars, which enables the feather bars to be printed or even angled in such a way that they allow the punctual insinculation of the shoulder of the sleeper.
It is an important thing for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattresses manufacturers who have started to use soft areas for the shoulder area in "man mattresses".
Even the ladies are thought - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) head pillow to the right mattress and the right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a tail rule: the head pillow should support the head, its peaks should only reach the shoulders so that the school termuscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm pillow, as it likes, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the side position, the head pillow (with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have been common with the old (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Also in mattresses, the new magic word "Bio" is called.
Rather than oil raw materials are used for the production of polyurethane foams, natural oils are increasingly common - for example rice and soy oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called for mattresses, which are the core of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Váek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance during sleeping can also be found.
Here too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooler" plant extract is used in men from birch leaves so that the mattress ratio can absorb the heat and cool the body, the rewards for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red peppers are stimulating blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
Due to the combination of the various stiffs (hardness) of cold and viscose foams, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where their head, hips and heels are located.
However, for a high quality mattress you have 7000 crowns and more to rap.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered medical aid.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and rust isn't that easy.
There are occasionally special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
So the Magniflex brand offers the mattress duofreeze with visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it is reinforcing.
It fits perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure burn, but also generally improves sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foaming materials are not only used in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot polsters to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children grows and so more and more parents consider monitoring them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented to search for cars can find people as well, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box but soon it should not be larger than a watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and fear, so they are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impaired privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a matter of spying, but an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a case-by-case case, such devices may be abused, for example, if one puts them in the pocket of someone without he knowing about it, but we have not seen such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his view, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not have such a thing to wear, he simply gets rid of it.
"Such as very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"At the beginning, the phones raised great expectations among the parents, but they can be switched off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappers, the kidnapper is virtually always checking whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also look for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be very helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech from the company RC Monitoring, which offers localisation services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be configured in such a way that it can report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Although it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a inclination meter is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his view, similar services could also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, only one special software needs to be played.
The problem with the current positioning devices is that it is either about devices in a wooden box size, the trailers are similar, or about smaller phones.
There's always such a danger that you lose them.
According to Mr Pilin von der Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he will only notice what gives the police a time ahead," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, always the same technology is used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of tracking function using the GPS system (like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition ropes that you could wrap whole the Czech Republic but keep you only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, fired with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the armaments.
It is already calming to know that the forces have spent 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the STV Group, i.e. for lippy 40 million crowns.
In its justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km ignition cord annually.
According to the research carried out by military pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES responded to it, this indication suggests that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometers of ignition cords halfway.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for training every new professional soldier, two meters of string, the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even in view of the increased need of the pioneer and specialty units.
In this connection, soldiers of the emergency brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for firearms, so shooting exercises of the lack of resources are severely restricted.
Don't worry about the shortage of pants.
"I don't even understand why they buy such quantities of ignition cords from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we as a dealer would like to meet as far as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of a hundred kilometers of ignition cord with the argument that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignition cords and police and military pyrotechnicians for only two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," one of them admits, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the expiry of the use period, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested if it is still reliable and not endangers the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not for free, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity reduction for the 445 km ignition cord.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," Pejšek tells us the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of pyrotechnical ignition cords from the police, the second World War II or the Soviet brother's army liquidating ammunition, has for a few years been barely over 1,500 metres.
And the police always order only those quantities of this ammunition that they can use before the end of their use.
Due to the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases is also open to more modern and thus reliable ignition ropes.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-popular Czechoslovakia People's Army was preparing for its expedition to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, in a few years the Czech forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres old ignition cords that they have bought so "good" today.
So far, the contacts that I won thanks to the competition have been found to me.
The victorious placement in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luk★ Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
Winner of the last year's competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luk★ Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success mutates like a film scenario.
Luk★ Pytloun was happy to travel.
Only abroad was he aware that in Liberec there was no good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and using a bank credit, he created a building house with five apartments.
When one remembers that he was a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time irritated me and so I tried to do something against it," says Luk★ Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of business in Liberec, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds for all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the Pytloun hotel franchise have already reported," says entrepreneur number one of last year.
"Great share of this license sale to operate hotels had just won in the competition "Enterprise of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun acknowledgingly.
The victory brought him greater awareness, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me later and I have to say that did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win the same time, every visibility is good.
He says that until today he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have come at all.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relationships until today."
In his view, the fame associated with success also draws a little attention to each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I do not really see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little in the foreground," says Luk★ Pytloun modest.
I wish my successors a more quiet year than we had in Farmet
The victorious euphoria was quickly removed from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his commitment, Farmet has the worst thing behind himself.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone competition of the year last year received Karel's farmer, the company owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to stamp a company from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this valuation has encouraged not only myself but also all my employees and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against the competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of Farmet's business history, the effort to do something useful was made.
And then when the state offered a small workshop for rent to his father Karel Ελλάδαrský as a compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company in which he was busy until then, sucked and founded with a few of his father's companions a company for making plastic walls.
Shortly later they began to focus on vegetable oil presss.
Within 18 years, they have risen to be the largest manufacturer of automatic pressing throughout Central Europe.
But only because of the success of the contest mentioned and its medialization, she also became aware of the non-public.
"Not only that our customers are now much more aware of the Farmet brand, but our foreign partners also started to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel.
The past year, however, was not only a sign of victory-euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tools.
The crisis, which at the time was even less shaken by citizens, but especially by companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation."
"The sales declined by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take redundancies," Karel explains.
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to control the situation and keep the company in black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to withdraw - in investment in research and development.
"With the grant we built a research and training centre, we reinforced our presentation at international trade fairs and won main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Ελλάδαrský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
Turnovers are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"To the new winner, I wish much joy to win - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel lets me tell you.
An opinion poll that cleanses up with insane rules
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some foolish rules have already managed to get out of the world.
As the doubtful winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available online began.
For example, more than one third of non-four thousand voters chose.
Thus, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have accessed it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will in future no longer require extracts from the trade register when checking social security payers," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Bura★ová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take into account all regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfil and repeal the insane.
This is already a fourth part of an entrepreneurial competition held this year by the tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoying increasing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hamper business.
"For example, in terms of the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havl.ek of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the stated objective of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks the 74th place in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year, with eight places lower.
The competition absurdity of the year was announced for the first time in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
From April until the end of September, everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz will be used. The competition organizer will select seven candidates for the "Anti-Price" and will allow the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most votes.
For this year's opinion poll, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been notified.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles must pay tolls for motorways and highways, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must provide every two years.
The list of the seven of this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November each is part of a happening where political and public life personalities are also regularly involved.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneur knoops between the legs, there can't be any real economic recovery, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessaryly complicating the entrepreneur's business," Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade, informed.
The efforts to create insane orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, the people most disrupted the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the commercial office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was repealed by a new commercial law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Employment Office services of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
As regards the absurdity of 2009, the regulation, which ordered physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two person weighings in the speaker room, was chosen.
This regulation has been slightly alleviated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation has fallen.
A new category commends socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new one in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Assistent Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your business on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon's mobile company, the provocator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each one of them is extremely inspiring and requires enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, because it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, who promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the principal sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also cared for its health-related workers, who represent 70 percent of their staff, for which she was awarded the title "A responsible company of the region of Mittelbohemen"; in the Vodafone company competition of the year she ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the MiRyz Soft accounting company won a flowing working time, which was also reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment," explains her Managing Director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is based on the health of its employees and has therefore bought them ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, also promotes homework for its employees and uses cartering services offered by a homely protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "Humans in Not", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance to its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We are providing our employees with contributions to meals, work paths, increasing their qualifications and holidays," says Josef StrapΕλλάδα by the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Sleese region.
For the category responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the Vodafon competition company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
False or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Assistent Company of the Year", but in the main competition of Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application for this competition alone is not possible, since it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public invitation to tender
In the Land Fund building in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police held arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was removed from the detectives in handcuffs.
It allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition currently taking place for the settlement of claims for reimbursement in such a way that the properties offered in the competition were brought to a specific interested party.
This guy is supposed to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At that time, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person because of the offense of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor of the newspaper "Právo", she could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released again by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in the light of the scarce official information.
The speaker of the Bodenfonds Lubomír Černá pointed to the question of Právo that the police had actually taken arrests at Pilsner's side of the Bodenfonds during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concreted.
According to Ms Černá, public competition had the correct name "requirement to offer claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the property offered.
"These persons, within the framework of the call, offer a higher value of their claims to be compensated by the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined and the ground fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund.
Luboš G. apparently had information available, who had logged in to the invitation and since he was himself a legitimate person, since he had purchased a number of claims for reimbursement, he offered to a property interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Apparently against a fat withdrawal.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Land Fund, which was criminally persecuted because he issued lands in replacement refunds to which location decisions had already been taken on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the ground fund, for example, acquired more precisely lands intended for the construction of public roads, where the construction of the access magistrals to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very conveniently with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the lands.
At that time, the town hall had to give little attention to the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs increase by a few hundred monthly
Households must not only expect higher costs for all types of energy from January, but also higher water and waste water charges, and for district heating and some areas, the rents also grow.
As of January, families will have to draw several hundred crowns more from the wallet every month than previously.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 per cent more expensive, gas 2 per cent and more, in some cities up to a tenth more water supplies will be paid, and some of them also charge the distance heat supplies.
The households cost a few hundred kroners more per year on their own.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so the debt is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic installations.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too, we can expect a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating are different from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay up to 50 kroners per month from January onwards, more than 1000 kroners per year pay more families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 per cent higher water and sewage charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure lease.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest compared to the whole Czech Republic.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4%.
For example, huge rental price increases are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will disappear from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Bouy, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rentals by 100 percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree to this increase in rent will want the company to have judicial interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech children drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, exceptionally a good whiskey that was stolen from the house bar from the father.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen have to be treated most frequently in need.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep out their cat in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in attending the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief doctor of the Children's Department in the Middle Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in removing a bottle from the bar, and if not, then at least distance or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most frequent is Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also Slibowitz that was taken from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Chief Doctor Pelikán, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers in hospital reception have long been no exception.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, at which he has worked since this year, he worked in the paediatric department of Motol Hospital for ten years, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from nearby and remote.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career started at 12 years when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and in combination with "extasis", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition site in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't feel strange at all that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," wonders the chief doctor.
It is precisely the lack of parents' interest or their incredible tolerance to push with their own sprayers that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a true dependence in the true sense of the word does not concern children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case for these children."
For those who consume alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is typical," explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, the speaker of the Motol Hospital was sent to the local Department of Children's and Youth Medicine by mid-November for about forty drunk children.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by parents or, where appropriate, by the police after ambulance treatment shall not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children drink only once a bottle of snacks in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes, which is 100% dependent on: Walpurgis Night, New Year's New Year and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for joy on holidays."
"I have experienced seven drunk children at the same time in the reception at Walpurgi night," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who will have to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning after that, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a liquid infusion of glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They're clearly better at it, because after the "great" experience in the evening, they wake up with good humour, without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, which sometimes destroys the patient's mood by telling them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed come well and gladly to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used this again and again as a means of education when I anticipated directly to the children at the visit, which has cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays over to earn the money for a single party like this," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his view, however, the sickness insurance institutions do not use regressive procedures to demand the costs necessary to cure drunk children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 out of five, exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It's the first time that machines of this guy are in possession of a foreign army.
So far, they were only seen in manövers or flight shows.
This is the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one seat L-159.
These are currently a preserved one in Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over it last week.
When she expeditions the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The one-seat fighter aircraft L-159, in turn, were separated from long-term stored aircraft without further deposits and investments from the department's headquarters.
"The double seats L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to end without two-seat combat aircraft, since in May 2009, the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody to convert four unnecessary L-159 into a two-seater version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to carrying the combat aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that the EADS company is a customer of the aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's business, how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The Economic Journal (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence did not sign up for a tender procedure, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, and the rest of them wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is likely to have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission brought the Czech Ministry of Defense to the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European invitation to tender and not by responding to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes of Casa, the last scheduled to land at Airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A longer finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose fingers are longer than the finger of the ring, are apparently at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Institute of Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should be subjected to a prostate cancer test, especially when there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, added Mrs Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in the UK pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time also 3000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the point finger was shorter in the right hand than the ring finger.
For these men, the likelihood of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and point fingers were the same.
However, in men whose fingers were longer than the finger of the ring, this risk fell by 33 percent, and in men up to 60 by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already prenatal, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer finger.
Earlier research has shown that testosterone is precisely an accelerator of the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that this study was volatilely known to him, yet he did not consider the relationship between the length of the finger and the risk of cancer to date to be "offensive".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways is mostly fixed snow, the winter servants were many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked for some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "is".
This said Novinky.CZ the sender of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed at 91 km, two trucks crashed at 93 km, and there were injured persons in this accident.
Also a few cars are in the street grave.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also been hit together here.
The drivers should drive right behind Brno at 190 kilometers or over Brno and drive at 182 kilometers near the town of Kývalka.
There are kilometers of staves.
Also on the D11, an accident occurred and that happened immediately on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car colonies form in the city of Prosek, even the street Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peaceplatz.
At 8 p.m. in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railways and at the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow damage.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers should definitely be informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. since Wednesday.
Most roads in the south are only available with increased caution.
To Vyškov, three sideways are completely unmovable, in the surroundings of Brno, there are sneakers, and in the surroundings of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Vůkov.
There are still three streets completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too, you will have to use snow milling for snow cleaning.
When they get rid again, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is recommended in the area of white carpates.
On the streets, which can only be scattered with inert dispersors for natural protection reasons, a snow cover of up to five centimeters, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of new snow, most of them in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Sleesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops slowly snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The U.S. troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the relationship of forces to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meet safety of just a few meters.
The special caliber 25 mm barns, designed for this gun and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small granates.
The barns can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when they crash on the target, but at any point of their ballistic track.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the shooting grave.
From above he is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splash rain from above can easily put him out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier proceeds like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, he wins a precise point of vision after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to print.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 m."
"When you push, the weapon loads up and shoots the shot on the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their job from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the industry giant specialised in computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their job from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs of the Group, which had previously been distributed over the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive and the large space offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the work of the employees.
Fujitsu was also only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The responsible Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region was a joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezern Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" was won again.
This is a "great location confession".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Lower Wheel.
Bad Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"We naturally offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have led to the rash.
Now it's about preventing a long space at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and the landlord of the building will cooperate."
The house previously used by Fujitsu on the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring "Small Verticals" were one of the most controversial construction projects of the Kurstadt with the rest of the buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project between the city and a private project developer, a new city gate was created between the railway station and the town hall, which was critical of both the massive construction of the previously partly used parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens, acquired the homes.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consultant in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more people are employed in Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is based in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this site are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this reason, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base riss - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industries has its seat.
Amazon locks server - Threats against Assange
Wikileak's device is growing in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to be in England.
The Wikileaks revealing platform is increasingly being fired in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, the prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is supposed to stay in Britain after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks away from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the Free," the revealing activists informed via short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the internet company Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had taken advantage of the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic dopes in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter Wikileaks continued on the step: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon had stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after senator Joe Lieberman's staff had been working on research, CNN reported on behalf of Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman now called for the platform to refuse the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unfortunate and unreasonable approach puts our national security at risk and threatens life around the world," said a message from the impartial senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for for rape suspected by the Swedish authorities, is on Interpol's search list.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange fears his security right, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the person responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures to be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, a consultant from Chief Stephen Harper said - apparently ironically - on television, Assange should be "deathed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, an exchange of strokes occurred.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laughterful and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known espionage demands on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government now puts the protection of its databases in full on the test stand.
As a Special Representative, Russell Travers, the Vice-Director of the Anti-Terror Action Centre, informed the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had become necessary after the publication of the messages reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to see how the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that if the Wikileaks release would put them in danger, they would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active.
"We have done everything we can to get in contact with them," said Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice bakers are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little old-fashioned the ice cooker, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice maker art.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a splash, drags it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice does not pass by the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University set up the manufacturer of Ice Machines in 2003 so that the Ice Cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the own ice dish.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare on smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business advisor and after years in a nerve-free job, he wants to insult himself.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice dish in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro related Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget, however, the crayon of the national and at all southern overbuilding: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacture seems very simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heated everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns up a hay on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, based on all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is asked with questions: Can Ice Cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimental desire run free?
Luciano warns of being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarber flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also produce ice without a stabilizer, only it will have to be sold within one day, otherwise it sucks in itself, and the customer bites on louder ice horns.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of aromatized additions."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbates with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream eggs and cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the participants are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano produces four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice cream varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit purple - tasty this is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss ice does not necessarily taste more nudger if it contains more hasselnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice production is a computing task: If peaches are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano draws out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wines thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computer eggs.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished mixture of ice is creamy beaten at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small pans do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates are clothed with fruit purple from top to bottom, when the overdimensional stem mixer is out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "is it just a matter of time until something like this happens."
Controllers in the dual light
The European Food Authority Efsa was submerged by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This claim is now formulated by the Expert Group on Test Biotech, which is an independent Institute for the Impact Assessment of Biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA testing rules for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
The EFSA rules are literally similar to the Ilsi position papers and thus deceive the manuscript of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that test biotech confuses a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-level EFSA manager is recently without any restrictions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed its sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Environment Agency as well as the EU Parliamentarians abundant.
However, the EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
It is stated in an opinion that all serious data, including those of industry, are used as long as they are of high technical quality.
Of the experts who work for EFSA, it is not required that they have no contacts with industry.
But you would have to disclose these.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is called itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobby assignment.
In the matter, independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any animal feeding experiment and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize makes on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not deliver reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?", then questions indictively.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently active at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe, as in the United States.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who were not linked to groups.
Critical studies for companies would generally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the Tuba on the back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: In September the draggers had retracted and started to break a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zig thousand protested against S21, the billion-dollar deep construction of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing was in ruins.
Breaked in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You're not allowed to disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he kicked one, he smelled like cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the bricks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammo deposit of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old works with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked the abrising in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to be grinded to Scotch or disappeared in the demolition," he says in his office, a wooden buoy that once was a guard's house.
He told him when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the break-up operator.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he has told them that he can't do anything for the debris now.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were continued to be used.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kilograms of squares, a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but some also in the hope of being able to give it back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large truck loads.
About half are still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, houses.
They would have come from everywhere, and they would have dragged away what suitcases and followers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long transformed into "Mäuerle" or to limitations of herbal beet.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"Well, wouldn't the political component be."
He climbs into his car, makes a tour through his 20 acres of kingdom.
Jura studied and discontinued, later biology, then he was interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones he stores.
From all over Germany, he collects his treasures.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow are artificially woven sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He shows on a pile: red sandstone, former part of Karlsruher train station.
And continue.
"Beautiful Travertin."
The quads were once part of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium tribe.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the St. Blasien Dom, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were previously cut by hand and moved with simple bottles and oxen cars, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shout something like that."
He hasn't become rich. He's not rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, also in the woods stone metze, a sculptor, a smith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the rest user.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There is ruler Andrarang at the Buffet.
16 students are pushing around salmon breads, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen invited the engineers and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to learn from VW developers about the car of the future - and also meet Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now taking part in the proximity struggle and, like VW, focus on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the hearing halls as early as possible before they arrive on the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, they are trying to explore the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group turns around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes bullets, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways to the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and collect experiences."
"VW can meet students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
It is new that the students are so offensively beaten.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
In particular, they need to re-prices and particularly to be paid to highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even greater according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for the KPMG audit and consulting company.
He organizes intense recruitment events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern sniper hunting where participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company through the United States next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG files and meet the company.
Anyone who is allowed to join will decide in two rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many candidates flies to the United States.
When shaking and sticking around the high potentials at the universities, the guns are increasing according to dykta.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sail drum was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to go on.
"To date, we have contacted all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some are in front of their graduation and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bulling on the campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also go very classically to the pirsch at professional fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa at Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of staff at Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The company in Bonn employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the youth problem.
There are currently 35 jobs on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy constant positions."
"That costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that you can do internships with us or write your diploma work."
expensive promotions are not recommended by solar specialists.
For this, the company attempts to advertise with other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This is often not possible for a large group," says staff manager Stübe.
Money hasn't played the main role in job searching.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good lifting opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute prepares an annual best list of German employers.
For this purpose, it interviews employees how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff Manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also be plus points with the job-seeker.
"I think that candidates are particularly looking for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal action.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through its own employees," he says.
In the industry year, the internal employer is branding, i.e. employer brand training within its own workforce.
"Satisfactory employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would advertise for their employer by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with bands," says warrior.
Obama stops new oil drilling
In front of the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The government in Washington has adopted a ban on this subject, thereby definitively revoking its previous plans.
New drills are prohibited before the Atlantic coast.
This was communicated by Minister of Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April is triggered by the strict ban, which will apply for at least five years.
Before the disaster, which cost 11 workers the lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure of the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever bears responsibility for the devastating oil in the Gulf has not yet been finally clarified.
The UK energy group BP is at the centre of its criticism, which is facing billions of demands.
An investigation commission on behalf of Obama is expected to present its results during December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies had submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which had been dismissed after numerous allegations of corruption, is undergoing a fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax lockholes for the oil and gas companies.
Industry now publicly warns that the amount of support in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than previously.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consultant company - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't stop," the ecoactivist calms the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to light a boy waving up to the chest in the water with the sleeves surrounding him: in the rainbow water shine, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not visible that brown crude oil swans float under the surface.
Earlier she had accumulated shrimps here, says Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty river.
In the meantime, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, from a brushed pipeline, unvolumes of crude oil poured into the huge wetlands.
Fishers from the nearby town of Bodo now have to ride six hours to get into fish-containing waters: the ogoniland located in the heart of the Niger delta is considered one of the worst ruined regions in the world.
The entire extent of destruction is visible on the journey through the mangroven muds perceived by rivers.
Rather than light water, the motorboat winds up brown breeze, who dives his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees ripped like black lakrits sticks out of the ground, sadly letting individual palm trees hang their wedges.
Bird swarms, as they are usual in wetlands, are chosen forgively: as soon as the external border is silent, in the former paradise, smelling like a petrol station, there is a splendour of tranquility.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly, "we live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorators from Europe entered, here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance, and here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still unable to return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipes, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the group is too unstable.
All a few hundred meters of steels like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christbooms" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded up to the mark.
Recurrently, such a drilling head breaks apart, according to Akpobari, then a constant current crude oil rip into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have flown into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year by year the amount of oil, as it pushed 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska at the Havarie of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing Eco-GAU will be disputed.
While the Shell Group is responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see drilling heads and leak pipes as the main polluter.
Shell puts far lower security standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner put forward to the Group in 2008: alone the rate of defects on the lines is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks out of the distance like a abandoned, oil-smeeded workshop under the open sky, emerge from the mangrove shapes: they are split and to the neck oil-smeed.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flakes: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First the gasoline pushes through the pipes into the pick-up top, later taps out at the end of the line Kerosin and finally diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter diesel barrels every day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low diesel price of nearly 40 euros per litre can still be subordinated by the illegal cookers: because their raw material is for free.
It comes from "bunkerers" that run the pipeline network across Ogoniland: this way, according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil daily throughout the Niger delta.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally intermediate raw material is illegally refined: filling the lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tankers and distorting it in the world market.
The debate whether the environmental disaster is more due to the movements of the population or to the lax production method, the activist Akpobari considers it to be purely academic.
"If oil companies had not perceived as intruders and had not thoroughly destroyed the life base of fishermen, there would be neither sabotage nor stealing or illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell was so destroyed that only one deduction from the group would be possible: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese become better."
That's where Michael gets nervous.
"Most time for you to disappear," says the musculoskeletal oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil breeders are caught by the special unit of the forces, they are not threatened by arrest, but are likely to be a painful lubricant.
The soldiers, mainly from the north of the country, also want to benefit from the raw material, like all Nigerians.
"This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible defect in the construction of a notified machine, which could lead to a "catatrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of the notified Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November seem to have known much more happiness than so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines during their investigations - and now warns against possible construction errors.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce tiredness and leaks, as stated in an opinion of the ATSB Authority published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Motors produced by Rolls-Royce were affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a plea before an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
When the engine was burned, parts had been dissolved and the carrier surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
At an A380 the Lufthansa switched the engine as a precautionary measure.
The double-floor plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany completely in White: overnight snow has fallen almost all over the country.
Chaos, trains and flights run out on many streets.
In the event of car accidents, at least three people died.
The winter frosts Germany: At ice temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowed on Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are partly 15 centimeters of thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is very limited.
At the A7 at Flensburg, winter service was in continuous operation, but the ever-new snow was not finished.
Heavy bows also swept over the Baltic coast.
The Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) expects from the morning on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein to flood storms with 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow damage on the highways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the Weather Center Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxony Switzerland the level of alert was violet - the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused decay.
There were several trucks and cars left in the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police reported major disruptions on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to storing traffic and stash.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to German railways, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed upper lines and softness are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds blew over the streets.
At large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight crashes.
In Munich, according to a speaker of the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights were already removed in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in permanent use.
Although only a few beached passengers are at the airport, they would still be ready for almost 400 field beds.
There were accidents on many streets on Wednesday evening.
In the evening a truck driver died during the collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly wounded.
Near Nuremberg, due to snow-covered roads, a similar accident occurred: even here a truck was recorded on a train crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore locked up to the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after having beaten herself on a smooth street with her car at Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow is still relaxing and powdery, it is already swinging up with light boars.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is affected by rapid and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its true mark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The German Bank has just made its corporate seat beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; then the bankers have been allowed to return to their old work.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the costs of renovation - and seek a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes on a speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check if it is more useful to own or sell real estate and then rent back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution returns its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers for 272 million euros from the investors of a home fund in the middle of 2007 and then thoroughly repaired.
The energy conversion resulted in about EUR 200 million.
I think a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now called "Greentowers" to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the Bank or to an independent investor, is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands of mourning for dead mate
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the ruined miners who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be secured because the security situation in the accident box is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, there was a violent explosion.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were drained underground.
A probe had been dropped into the unfortunate box, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance for the mate to survive.
The bodies have not been secured until now.
Now family and friends with a commemorative celebration reminded the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island at the raying sunlight.
They've been silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the friends could be seen.
Images and personal objects, including clothing and surf boards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags weighed half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not end with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was cast into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been scattered.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were extinguished, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn, with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising", relocates old genre limits.
What audience could the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his pity and with almost overhuman forces rows his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabies killing methods and his enemies have already ripped the guts out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, one eye, as it is actually called, does not say the whole film about a word, and the other figures can be screamed at most to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, it will be silenced and swelled in the terribly beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world has been offering the scenery of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera tours.
Nice if a movie has multiple target groups, only harm if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses stoically to make his works with a little more humor available to the main stream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse.
Most cino-friends are expected to be dissuaded by the injection of brain mass and guts around.
The action fans die no later than before boring when, for freely interpretable reasons, one eye breaks up with a force of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and holds an eternity in flush and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to silence there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a pity especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hiding, which has earned some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a stringent act, it's all the atmosphere, a film-based fever room.
And from it there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and sniffs him slowly to the throat with his glacial images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but especially with the unbelievable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blurred boy who faithfully stands at the side of the eye keeps himself like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never declared, but who eventually becomes a warrior of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the Devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for those who have been corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to trouble, excitement and astonishment.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new indications on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is opposed to taking a position - it still allows controls.
By midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft attack a mysterious, cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrat; the next largest city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Sauur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the quad with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that departs from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence service CIA from the end of April 2008, the common reactor would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built, even under the name of the nearby village of El-Kibar.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the 1950s is hardly dying.
The CIA performed a video presentation with uncharved satellite images.
By computer animation, she blended in where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just prior to commissioning, said it, but had not yet been equipped with burning bars.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly more known than then, yes, the puzzles became more bigger over time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was quite sure before the attack, Syria built a reactor in El-Kibar, but did not see any evidence that there was a "active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "probable reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diploma answered only lapidar in summer, the IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions".
The fire of the alleged "unused military building" was created by the Syrians in a hurry and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen was found in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, via a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial suppliers directly after the attack, which is likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always cost to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium stems from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors of a second inspection in el-Kibar and the access to the ruins of the broken building.
But Israel also silences iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has gone without results since June 2008 and "has become increasingly a serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a high-level Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - a serious violation of the nuclear blocking treaty is in the space over which the IAEA is waiting.
As a key to progress in informing, the IAEA seems to see three other institutions "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and otherwise still exist.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are, what function they have or what they are suspicious of.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and discovered a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this reason Syria denies IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to send out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported between the three locations and the quad at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes required for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are credible assumptions to these central issues.
It is also unclear whether dams, which could mountain valuable traces, were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the shot was left.
The only few kilometres from El-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, the salt mine al-Tibni, which in 1998 examined Syria as a radioactive waste warehouse, is considered to be unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley recently contacted her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, recordings from the Orbit show that Syria was working on earth in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to eliminating the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months to develop an inspection plan there to allow Syria to keep any military secrets - just the effort to demonstrate the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats had weakened a year ago the reactor was destroyed, so the matter had no high urgency, for example, US ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months has brought into play so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Atomic Authority has to carry out controls.
While the IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and on the other hand, some of the 35 countries represented there are nothing but escalation.
On the other hand, how does a diplomat say, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless debut in summer, there are problems.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
That's much more you don't know about it, but that's enough for unrest.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim, persists in falling in love with her Serbian rapers during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some of the round days planned in Sarajevo have been moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is turned off in Hungary and in post production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female victims of war wrote about UNHCR refugee assistance to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie himself is ambassador of UN refugee assistance.
It is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps had not existed, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee mission, your organization recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who got to read her script, has given Sarajevo, after a few times, a tour permit - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author himself deplores that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
So a second synopsis on the film on the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers already knew about it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds much different than the variant " rape victims are blurred in torture servant".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on her, according to Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now, I guess only the hackers of Hollywood can bring peace: by placing the script illegally on the net, as so many people have done before.
Nothing like getting out of here
This evening it's finally going right again for the Irish.
No trace of grief.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans roared for joy in crawling loud music, they stamped with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the South Irish Cork is busy because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Beerpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro win premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this screaming drink game and the reluctant computerist, which doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to have fun in distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play fun in Las Vegas, he will hold applications in New Zealand in January.
"I have a feeling of mouth," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have a job there."
After all: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a crack, tock her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, says experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015 they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a huge loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of immigration similar to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of revival, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, sadness is now spread again.
The economic crisis is predominantly uncertain to the young, well-trained Irish people for whom it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in the abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are more readers' letters from young immigrants who complain: "All goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one then turns out the light."
Jura-student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future, because the government is only doing eyewashing and no longer offering young people prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-olds.
She observes how her compatriots hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is it to have to emigrate itself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a round service on work abroad.
"For professional beginners, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gala service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has been aware for six months.
Because there was nothing to do with the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just pull up a fashion house.
In January it will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home is now rarely seen by O'Donovan because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is a little crazy already," he says, "when after a long time he comes over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am as good as never again."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with maintained gardens, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 4 years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% credit funding.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid he might be wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, casts hot tea after and says, "I don't have any children I have to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The engineer does not like the grievance he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we only feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how things go with life elsewhere.
He has a few years of work in London, and why shouldn't he and his girlfriend run well in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that concerns him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could be a good-bye party.
"Don't blow too many emotions," he says and drinks a big drink of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a party, quite relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results included the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995, showing the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly in mind in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic supporters increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is so simple as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This lasted during the world economic crisis, perhaps because the Latin America countries only experienced a short phase of recession and recovered rapidly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
But there are strong mood differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the departing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents reported that the private sector is essential for development, with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% explained that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
Brazil has, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Choice Sleep
No one had expected that the elections on November 28 would be perfect in Haiti.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the voters who hurried the land to help.
Overloaded ballots, multiple votes, ballots in the rhinnstone, destroyed ballots and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, strived around for a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, called for the withdrawal of election results due to alleged fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as quite good in many matters".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is supposed to be obliged to the unpopular president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected stitch selection is available for January.
There is hope for the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, Rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claim.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, declares the poller to the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, there was a fear of a low participation.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organisation in voting.
Just before the election began, about 250,000 IDs required for the election were not yet issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are in the same opinion.
Homely in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, the Argentinian president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you will help this again next year depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often made budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president's couple to spend the extra revenue on their own discretion.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further extinctions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian struck another face and others rejected the government of bribery), the Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget will now apply to the next year, which will give the President even more opportunity to spend money on its own.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11.1%, but a number of private estimates - and wage demands from trade unions - raise the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as its main objectives, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scarced the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which then beautifuld official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
And official statements suggest that wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth rate by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government concluded an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt repayment in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to insist on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected an IMF review, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the first step to cleanse the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of which has enough of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to them will be deciduous.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she will lift many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly.
Lack of applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the seaside?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million electors, which are 70% of all electors, took place to elect mayors and councils in the five districts. This is considered as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland through the development of breakthrough business relations, including a partial free trade agreement. Her policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Mom's been through the test, but it's just a little bit short.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In the event of a presidential election, this would have meant my problems.
Since his election two years ago, the percentage of his party's votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved to the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with crabs, flag-swinging mass moves and only scarcely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempt to murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT held a speech on a KMT candidate on the evening before the election,
When a man shot him from the crowd in the face. Lien was wounded and a neighboring spectator killed.
Crazyly, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more voices.
China may have been the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not the subject.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the Beijing government in the forefront.
But this time, the DPP also avoided the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It thus responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Mum, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese people are in favour of China's policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipeh to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now been re-invented.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he insisted on absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai, as the presidential candidate of the DPP, found great support, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea smitting as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires unprecedented discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "reliable alternative" to Mas' early approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he stated that the candidates of the DPP had better done to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the Pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his infamousness seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between poor and rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of realignment.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Award. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was awesomely nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules whereby an artist may have released no more than three albums before the release of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her swinged voice and a good sense for pop, radio and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003 whose great success in 2003 comes nearest as a jazz interpreter in this category of nominating Spaldings.
In addition, the album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This was a huge success for the critics.
Among the competitors of Iyers are, among others, "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbed favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, where more albums from Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well deserved attention in the category large group. He thus confronts Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leading into the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53th Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Two Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra work, with three votes.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and released in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandoline concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, mountains "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a grammar.
Pärt's symphony No. 4 was staged and recorded in the Disney Hall on 4 January by the L.A. Philharmonics under the leadership of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Mandolin artist Avi Avital who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category orchestra presentation for a recording of the works of Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental soldiers, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harfinistin Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, Sopranist Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took the unanimity of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Criticists rejected the project to promote both terrorism and traffic.
However, according to a statement made by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre corresponds to the local rules and will become an esthetic eyecatcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahies, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being distributed fairly uniformly according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America anymore," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic Centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud called Harmoush for non-violence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wished for a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filters.
The new mosque of about 2.300 m2 in the Mediterranean style should have two miniatures and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic resistant microbe could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien bacterial species that can live, among other things, from arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is in their opinion a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it's almost a kind of 'extraordinary' form of life," Paul C.W. Davies from the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, published on Thursday in the online edition of the magazine Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"Then one wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to too widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act on discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start biochemical processes using other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily specified," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery wasn't random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes that are both exposed may replace one element by another.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the chemical similarity of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it is almost all dirty," explains Anbar.
The researchers put the bacterium GFAJ-1 into an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally either on the earth or on another planet or on the moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsen occurred more often in the early years of the earth, she says, therefore science has assumed that early forms of life have used it.
"This gives reason to assume that life may have evolved differently from in the early Earth Age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dog found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen before a Bellflower motel were found, according to the statement of the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown stealed the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower motel 6 nights, according to the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well on," Whitmore says.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information on the location of the dogs, nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still under way."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We're following a few traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district pet home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the truck and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old Rüde, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were uninfected according to the official statement.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppet, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window open a wide fragment, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised to anyone who could give a hint to the Corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder's wage was paid.
The lion is crying again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptor formally blessed the "prepared" creditor plan to offset the debts of $5 billion and to open the way to the 86-year entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer be in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be presided over the slightly spicy studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself brings $75 million, is managing the company. The funding is expected to be by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management that fought with interest payments of $300 million per year, solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, known by his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and pay the more than 140 creditors of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything began from the beginning of the MGM team with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which have already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who has been paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year the studio only released one film and created a plan of seven or eight films to come to cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that are to be created under Peter Jackson's leadership.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can break a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic spring lines or about 48 doses of play doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost at the same time a little less than last year.
And even though less new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cell-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plucking figures, as large as sea pigs who sing a note when pushing their stomach.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several singing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have started pressing once, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new shark feet with wheel blocking it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Player Coal, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can make a car ride to a classroom, with a better wiper with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't like to trust your child your smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included therein are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8).The five blocks are not larger than a sticker box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before time goes on. It is great for an improvised bookboard competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy shops on your own, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important ones.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy for example a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figures Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child gets enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be wheel shoes or a puffle stick.
The latest head cell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The pot moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an irrigated garden of clums.
And he's endured a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become more gentle
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checked his nervous subordinates and issued commands with military authority and humid voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary racing and their hanging to violence - to impress the viewers.
"Just stand!"
"Click straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are like them!"
Four girls, hardly grown away from the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight row.
Four regular hats were perfectly sitting on the hair held with blue-white loops.
"For me they look average," Mr. Tang notes little value.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a shining blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-stars: According to reports in 2009, 50 officials circled an unspecified snack car and stared at the operator until it packed and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a town district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police. They have been selected specially due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials may only enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different image.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei's province fought a spectator to death when he filmed her with his phone when they smote a protest against a garbage.
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, which describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghain watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A video game that can be downloaded from the Internet, which is violent, shows trained officials in China in an attack on road dealers.
"Chhengguan is scaring the government," the China Daily national newspaper complained last year, after further controversies about the tactics.
The newspaper called for "really thorough cleansing".
Scepticists believe that the current approach is clearly insufficient.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by ad in October, a editorial at the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job report, women between 18 and 22 years of age were searched for with a good figure and "harmonic facets".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment ratio ends with the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physical.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district officer at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facials, etc."
Then come temperament and "internal qualities".
"Women Chengguans are like flower vases," he said and added, "but in addition they have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Administration, does not wish to agree with this description:
However, it was admitted that in China sizes are not unusual in job advertisements for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facets.
It is controversial in China whether this is a good appearance.
But people with disabilities or physical depositions do not need to apply.
"We can't use lame or buckly here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrouilled on the Baoguang place near a monastery, is 22, has apple bag and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel sexual that her appearance was so much valued.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the caves, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, because they have more ambitious career plans than simply cheating dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip is concerned with about twelve road dealers who try to sell as many sandwiches and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before being hunted.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so often," explains Fr. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and who had temporarily abandoned his nut kitchen fixed on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than energetic.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in leisure distribution.
"All routine."
One reason is that female officials cannot confiscate the goods of the dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report to their male supervisor.
This is intended to protect them from public hostilities to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, randalized after the rumour that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured during the night's incident, 14 government vehicles were convicted or fired.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
However, unrests are not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang place, where the female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired against the rules on the bargain instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials went on the way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male streak, remained behind, turning his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're acting verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," explains Mr. Li.
"Most of the time people start fighting."
Attorney will not accuse Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the charges brought against him after his deal with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most severe legal claim against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which provided headlines across the country and made his career a damper, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the judgement after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were terminated and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgement was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had failed to respect the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published for the first time in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, was able to purchase lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during an Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign took contact with some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interrogations he took over for them after the Hampton lobbying work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friendly before the deal, violated the so-called ban on the door-to-door lobby.
According to the published indices, "it seems to be an agreement and a violation of the rotary door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defence of clients in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethics Attorneys said that the Ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Attorneys "is apparently frightening," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington" (a organization whose goal is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another one on the next day, when he was informed that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I am not happy to go into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to terminate investigations for a separate complaint by the Ethics Group, after which a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act had been infringed.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was at the Ministry of the Interior for a matter of "anglofs".
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister for Transport to agree on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
Last year, when for the first time information about this relationship came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologised to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the ranking of the Republicans.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigation, his press speaker Jennifer Cooper, who hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal alerts on Twitter
Half a dozen of them fell away in the crabs in the courtroom.
In the minute tact, they sent their reports of cruel witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter notifications about the process of rape and children chained on beds in a house that occurred in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's conviction of the jury's death falls.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed applications to the court, which provide reasons for an appeal and which the courts will deal with for years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread and immediate permeation of intrusive details, so that the jury had been influenced in an unacceptable manner by public disarmament.
This opposition could cause appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I experienced it during this process, I think it is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of everyone to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's chief defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue, from the Supreme Court, rejected the requests by decision last week, when he said that the New Media would be "controlled carefully" and that there would be no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on famous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States repealed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who should have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the court room" due to the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the movie "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court proceedings, which Mr. Haye's convictions were considered half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of the case with Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that the limitation of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes more fair.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes might have been prejudicial when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurys by showing them cruel photographs of the crime site during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their tutor, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, they would have filled with disgusting.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, and argue that the judge had wrongly exchanged a judge who had been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he would have inadmissiblely put pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurys were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a judgment contest that they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had constantly re-enriched the flames of emotions over the case.
"A day-to-day change of media pipsers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "was not experienced in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the assertion that these direct messages are more reluctant than reports that are slower refunded is a technically hostile view that weakens reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument, that social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their opposition they referred to the Supreme Court's decision of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," she wrote, "Sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness connect the separator?
After a campaign of shy words and negativeity, little politeness has been broken out this week in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions were taken.
After all that is heard, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partyal point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems to be clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that hides the ideological gap that continues to separate the members from each other.
That is hardly enough to claim it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one in which one of the other calls for cooperation and compromise, while one attempts itself to balance the boundaries of the public opinion and the patientness of the voters after another party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or responsibilities, the two sides are kilometers away from each other.
Finally, the November election Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the Lame Duck Session, the Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is expected with regard to increased unemployment allowances, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of Brooking's Introduction warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of inconsistency is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see much that happens from today to 2012 as a fight, or shadow boxes, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
As concerned as the Republican leaders may be that they are too high poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and eliminate health reform.
These party lines are already reflected in the first reactions to the Commission's recommendations on deficits, which include fiscal reform and the increase of some taxes, the increase of retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own opinion, have pushed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they struggle very much to get close to this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes and the health system, followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Anyone who is convicted of losing will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic viewpoint.
Partiality and polarization are larger today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure precedent for a far more consequential election in 2012.
In this way, many Americans may welcome the courtesy that is being shown this week.
However, there will be much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that are still separated from each other.
Transmitted US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control lies in the hands of the "cleptokraty" and it gives a part of the bribery and protection money that it collects to Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are extorting high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate shops, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leaders move upwards.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his website.
The memo is based on sources whose name has been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow Mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime he would have been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous lawsuits against such charges.
In September he explained to a Russian television station when asked for a documentation suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as happens in the Ambassador's report, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government to crime has led some to call it "disrupted" and to conclude that the government acts more like a clergy than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, meaning literally "top" or protection), which extends through the police, the state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Attorney General as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lower level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source is, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer the same as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to some pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The Memo of the Embassy contains descriptions of men who go into the Kreml with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Over the country, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks at 154 a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International ( countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The disclosure of the memo of the American Embassy, which took place late in the evening of Moscow, will certainly cause discomfort within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a falsification and responded angryly to the disclosure that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a weakly illuminated, concrete classroom with dirty and blazing walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge Führer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg, northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of Khmer Rouge to the government, long-standing followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to confront publicly with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former head of the famous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, difficult their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they do not have the power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illnesses, revisions or hunger.
When the Vietnamese entered and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and his military fled to Thailand to the border of Cambodia.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to Anlong Veng next generation.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to government, leading to the kapitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their sons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although some of Khmer Rouge's elite officers kept their local government positions because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager of the Rhône Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice grower.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, to court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the horror acts, but it has not been said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years old, which had been district head in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told commissioners of the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project in which thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, In Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun long shades on the dried grass, the Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court invites them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodge lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodscha must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The center created the first school book on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia", approved by the government.
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are sentenced by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek mountains, a path overwhelmed by shrubs and disturbed with plastic waste leads to a rectangular of black rush, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here on a tyre pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone seller on the street side, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last place of rest, where she will lay a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to further collect weapon-able uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign on global nuclear security, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that a high-enriched uranium will no longer be collected, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years the U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached an obstacle last spring.
However, US government officials told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements were concluded with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapon-friendly uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuklear Security Summit of 47 Nations" in April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms, which is fundamentally capable of weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said then.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs from it, and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it expressed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first start to remove the Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, says official.
It was loaded into a special train that is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory, says official.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to the official.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Providing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapon-shaped uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its warehouse by 2012 according to the common agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's severe disrespect of human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcome to the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across the Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as indicated by a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents cast by Wikileaks and forwarded to the newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former Deputy Head of Government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid for human rights disastrous practices was accused in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the report of the Council "has taken Zapatero offside" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to the Spanish state's services flights."
"They just want to be informed" in order not to be "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because they lie in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the Attorney General Vicente González said that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the Ambassador explained after a conversation with the Attorney General.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts for discreet handling between governments," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, at which the US Ambassador and the Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely concerned with their independence and would do what they thought appropriate", he had directed his employees to " avoid blown rhetoric comments in order to disrupt tension."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, because of a hint that the government of Zapatero's actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, or have deliberately ignored, will tolerate capital, even if these disclosures could have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasises.

Shortly after that, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen man was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the young woman stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the contents of her news, it can be concluded that her love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy for the whole day and not be free, do and let what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine myself for a job on the 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she's taking her firstborn when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him again with someone other than my mother," a doubtful intention, if you consider their bad relationship.
In July there is another email.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and allegedly was murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place he likes a little bit, but on the other he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the babysitter."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss of Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See if he wants, he finds me such a shit."
On 30th, one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in Anime- and Mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser".
"Terror a la gallega (heading)".
The last man who lived with her, an obedient hunting overseer, explains to have a bit of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she hadn't told him that she was a single parent.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca to Palma Province Prison.
The duty defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the outcome of the matter, "and she did not intend to harm the little one."
Previously, however, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and to spoiling his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections - preferably or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the Catalonia elections.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's electorate - should persist, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congress members in the parliamentary elections, while CiU will also win four (it has now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party analysis, the ERC would lose a member - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its member or win one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Even the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to the socialist dominance, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the largest urban administrations: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists do not achieve a majority or rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debacle, it is not fair that this party will lose its representation in the City Council of Barcelona, in which it would have to reach 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its proportion of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's changeover, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida lies only 500 votes behind the PSC. Mayor, Engel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party had a significant increase.
Currently, PP is represented in 34 Catalonian urban administrations and aims to establish lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers arrested by the Barcelona Police Station formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Motion for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Attacks in Bombay, who demanded 106 deaths in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches a great importance to these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that the "Operation Campai" has been " weakened" by Al Qaida's counterfeiting device worldwide and "sometimes their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years when the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was formed, so that their "fighters" could penally cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only jihadist network that was active in Europe, so other European police units have also been involved in the investigation in addition to the Thai investigation bodies. It is not possible to exclude the fact that in the area of the EU in the next few days there will be attacks similar to those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another person was arrested in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourist passports according to the terms of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
Research circles stress that no connections have yet been established between the Catalonian arrested and the Attack in Bombay, although the author of this Attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the falsified passports stolen in Spain and subsequently in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousands of dollars had been sent from a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid mobile phone cards, which later were used by the members of the "commando", which put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls for a suspension of the tax agreement from Mas
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas's conditions to support his accession as Prime Minister of the Generality, which are not different from those already made during the election campaign, and which can be summarised with the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence deterrents, such as a financial balance agreement that the regionalist leader intends to propose at the top of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party turned with security to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who had won her last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel essential, because the candidate of the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party is dependent on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties will abstain from voting when he enters office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible appendix with the PP. However, the discussions that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders are turning around Catalonia.
As far as the PPC's party president is concerned, he calls for "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to that of the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even intends to be subjected to a referendum.
Both political leaders are common to make the built-up political device of regional administration narrower and to abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's office are addressed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he meets with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old-age care home reaffirms that deaths are not due to "deficiency" measures.
The owners of the old house in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than eleven elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat Hospital in Olot, Gerona, held yesterday a press conference in which they highlighted the damage caused by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work.
Joan Sala, head of the Old Care House, joined his lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible for the deaths", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a social loss of reputation because it had not found the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but also now pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime went back to August 2009 and that he continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients in the old care home - since he suspected that no doctor had investigated the deceased personally, but that the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illnesses.
The leader of La Caritat denied this point all the way and said that "remaining measures could not have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute there would be no evidence of negligence of any person other than the accused."
The already baptized as "Death Angel" was 11 murders yesterday and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquillisants.
The director of La Caritat stated that the access of the staff to the medicines was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail used the nurse in six out of nine crimes to release patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from inside by giving them bleach, as he had confessed to three women who he murdered between October 12 and 17th.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the caregiver's statements, even in terms of the number of murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the judiciary.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk increases in the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has hardly been devoted to issues that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers to the extent that it collapses, however due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, which the ECB will have to revoke tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of public debts, as they were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program for the purchase of bonds to continue and send out a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday will be thrown back and if it is firmly insisted that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed that the purchase of government debt securities was not considered and the markets collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and perseverant.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt gap were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10,000 million in the short term and possible further 15,000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are being nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will have to receive parliamentary approval for its new budget, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There is a need for political unity to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions as well as in financial institutions, reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures, measures that sound like four years in the ears of investors like Vivaldis.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has invested 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is an important auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debtability.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a sacrifice for itself.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury Office has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed for no time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be consistent with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now counts not only the being, but also the appearance."
Just courage, we can do that!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen appeals to Vega Sicilia.
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, the owners of the societies of Eulen and El Enebro, does not fail.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's gorge, will challenge El Enebro's joint venture, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, since he considers them "absolutely nullity". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company, the owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute about the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company services seems to be not willing to give up the control of the institutions of El Enebro in his dispute.
He was expelled from the board of directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the board at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which was already registered in the trade register as contested.
The joint venture of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Madrid Trade Court No. 2 for the 16th, triggered a new thunderstorm in the Álvarez family.
The referral of the judge to the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - in order to allow the assembly of 18 January to be recognized by legal seizures, fraud and legal abuse", as official speakers have explained.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent appeal of the assembly to declare it "absolutely void".
In June, the same protagonists, who kept themselves in discreet silence, tried in vain to convene a congregation in a judicial way.
With El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, besides other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the proceedings for appeal, for which no date has yet been laid down.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since Red Bull ended up in the world of Formula 1, her history has been characterised by the speed of surprises and successes in this glorious universe.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newer and despite his steep upward course during the last season, at the end of the season, all of them were on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso in November.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands and thus created a team of winners has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with car races.
This computer program called PLM has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and highly precise instruments.
The purpose is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens Industry Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and tests.
Russworm concludes that in 1992, on average ten technicians worked in the race stations, who were able to introduce up to three or four improvements in a season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull's team. With powerful computer systems, they carry out analyses and any possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault exclusively declares itself responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff comprise 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the Energy Drinker puts into the services of his participation on the race routes, other protagonists are hiding, whose support is invaluable and their familiarity is zero.
Steve Nevey, the technologist of the plant, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in the R&E field for racing cars contributed 50% to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of a sales network of twenty shops with each 80 to 100 square meters, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agreed on this initiative with the 16 existing multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example the rebuilt shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, which has been working with HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice-chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of loading opening was always the same. It was based on a local distributor with experience and industry skills.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive loading equipment (with interactive products for handling). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of laden staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive sales office network was intended to "optimize the customer service and consulting small and micro-enterprises when buying and afterward, yes, even the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilgrim program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as for private customers, since large companies already have their technical customer service contracts," Helena Herroro explained yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals to 'clave' a million customers in three years
The CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a break in the interest rates that banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and loans prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - an over-existing trade.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the public aid from FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 when deducting the customers that will lose the bank - which is the great challenge that this bank is facing, because so far it has devoted more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers account for more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. outterity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the Bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Only a few banks are dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks' plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its guideline Optima four years ago this year, which was originally designed to be three years old, but due to the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the Bank.
At a breakfast organised by APIE Guardiola, 2011 would be a "stricky" year "with great range".
The manager assumes that Spain would only get out of the crisis "slowly".
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities - which will punish the interest margins - will flourish, the risk supplements that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already be used as a compensation for declining profit margins to the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We haven't turned off the hen, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued on Thursday the order to its branch network to restrict long-term loans and increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of November 22 and 27).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks currently pursued the stategie "to increase fees", but "in a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not in vain he assures that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"The next year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasises that the need for capital is currently "enormally increasing" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will abort in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of capital stockpiles.
Having assured that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he discouraged the argument of some bankers who already foretell a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put in circulation, but, unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be achieved through repo transactions and thus the crisis could be resolved.
ECSC excludes a second merger wave of savings funds
The ECSC Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected yesterday the possibility of a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed of restructuring the industry.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not take part in the first phase.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be seen as a second round, rather than adjustments."
"The majority of this is completed. It may be that instead of seventeen, threeteen or fourteen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that "the concentration process was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit set in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17, each 75,500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 per cent and are now much larger, which we have achieved the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a number of unspoken opinions on the slowness of the process, which revealed our own unity and insaneness", because "Banco de España urges us to conclude in time before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financial systems in Europe and "maybe" in the world, and added that those who doubted would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy we need to "do not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks who have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also reminded the Spanish banks that the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July had been very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to maintain the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the cancellation of 426 Euro support for unemployed unemployed who do not receive unemployment allowances, and the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former President of the Government, Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It was presumed that Merkel's position was not a mistake in public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of re-definition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the past traditions of a majority of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, we begin to speculate over three possible ways out of the crisis in Germany.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of German Mark - although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Thirdly, a reform of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; penalties for countries that fail to comply with the requirements; possibly the termination of payments in some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been marked for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German government moved a constitutional reform out of the sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of disparity between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country as Merkel pushed the decision to rescue Greece painfully.
That was strongly criticised at that time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely opposed to a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel emerges with a clear position and calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time to oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European position, as it led the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, although some sweetened, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that - even if unpleasant measures now need to be taken - the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area, in which the infringing countries will be severely punished, to be forced to declare themselves ineligible and in this case the private sector will have to take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a tough growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external economic balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as pointed out by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad about not understanding it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is betray ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will pass more quietly.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the possibilities considered, we should not exclude the euro area, which has been completely stuck with less serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the 23rd November game against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was a sporty act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (her team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the required sanctions in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the club trainer José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten rules but followed in this sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is based on the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which in his hymn has presented nobleness and honour and had punished its players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the main role in this process, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, which has added a more episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate turns about whether this non-expressly banned behaviour is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention. In fact, this approach is consistent with the rules of sport, but it seems to be circumventing its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not jeopardized by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players benefit unjustifiedly from the counter team. Nor did that happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by misplay or circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited down and accepted the sanction joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders took from the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasised here that the rival has not been brought into a more disadvantaged situation or benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree unconscious advantage, as the team could eventually quit. In addition, players with this approach receive a sanction and pass into the second card cycle, in which they quit with a card accumulated less than in the first cycle.
It is therefore not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they would rather choose when they would be subjected to them.
They made a strategic decision without a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the limit between invention and the regulatory environment is misguided, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemic has arisen due to two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage to the principles of sport caused by these acts is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer opening for customer catch for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops a lawn of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are again group evening meals that deliver oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurant and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they are launching a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the big mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirms the interviewed entrepreneurs and associations.
In order to make the bookkeeping even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of dinner reservations to two top tenants (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group evening meals for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it from their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation is, the lowest prices are required, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Restaurant Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Dachverband dares not yet to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"The people think about it ten times before they book."
"They would like to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he stressed.
The business will go well with those "to offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most demanding by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 will lead the suppliers to a collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, who maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the originality of the calendar has led to precedented reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, who manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 locals in total, you do not lose optimism after the revenues have flourished again and good since the second quarter, although a few days focused prospects for the Christmas business are awaited.
Sources of the Group stress that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends groups that celebrate Christmas.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu has been added for 30 euros or more than price hit. It has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and, in return, want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprinkles spread, so the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the group meals are back in recovery.
On the side of the Dachverband Fecasarm (with mergers such as the Bar, Restaurant and Recreation Association of Barcelona), the Vice-President, Enric Gomà, trusts in seeing the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "live" as a whole, even though the customers "expose a maximum".
However, the fun in celebrating was not reduced, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is causing great concern in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks' revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, unveiled by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington.
At the edge of the clearing and juicy details that provide the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not strengthened, but rather "reduces" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the specific nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not compiled, but that their parts are stored in order to complicate their destruction in a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the territory attacked by the Taliban, the likely dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered not only by the United States but also by Russia as exquisite and reason to be careful.
"Pakistan must recruit highly believers to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or rocket programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American official colleagues.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in nuclear proliferation declines and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", explains: "There is often no transparency; we will not receive any answers to aid offers or they will be rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, State Secret Service Officer for South Asia, confirms that "because of the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington, during a visit to the Chief Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to the responsible person that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent support from terrorist groups."
In hunting for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol gives a red warning for the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complex labyrinth in which things are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" for Assange's "invention and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from November 20.
It has nothing to do with the last disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australians must face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of Wikileaks' founder, Mark Stephens, assures "the police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority with its headquarters in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had received the authority.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to arrest and deliver him provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organization, many Member States consider the red warning to be a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be present.
Assange's lawyers who published a letter informing them that Wikileak's 39-year-old founder is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and was compared with Stalin's security manager, Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, who received the permission.
"This is like a hunting, not like a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia bears the innocence of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he interviewed the director of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location. He asked for the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy out the United Nations and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the Press Secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "laughterful and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should focus on the opinion of a guy using a website," he explained to the broadcaster CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by the speaker of President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by Conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congress member Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies from January, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of placing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to seize their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, adviser of Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to "be murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Everyone who has sent through information in the government is guilty of treason, and everything that is not executed is an oath to mild punishment," he explained to the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a blind eye to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on his persistence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the principle of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the twentieth time of an internal revolt in the rows of 11 Members and half of the electorate's votes to the ERC without direction.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient to the close-up of the former leader of the party Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor itself and will not cause him the same headbreaks as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a blind eye, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
At the beginning yesterday, more than 200 regional council members of the ERC announced that they would be able to express themselves secretly on their stay in office.
With polling lists, not with lifted hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss the President a penal penalty, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subjection among his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod neighbours demand from the President more than just to make his office available to the party. An inadequate gesture because Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the congresses.
However, as they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Executive Board on an action plan from now to May.
To this end, they expect the management to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council for vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, the party promises to present the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party's tip already considers to be a fact.
The ERC party president believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and seeks to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors forever.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party president was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He counted five of them, two of which are in the forefront.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general assembly principle as a function.
He thus advocates a reform of the statutes to allow the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, who had already fought for it at the last two congresses, is as obsessed.
In fact, at the 2008 bebossing assembly, party leadership was commissioned to review the principle of the Assembly at a congress to review the statutes.
This date is still due, since the information of the internal rest of recent years has not been advisable to deal with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time could have come to take up this matter again and to close it forever.

On the skin of the woman tattoos were discovered by Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding images.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle in the municipality of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies were discovered by two men whose heads were covered with adhesive tape and a communication in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In contrast to the body, there was a message probably signed by a criminal organization, saying, "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies attached to hands and feet with torture traces were found inside a taxi posted behind the judicial centre of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month the bodies were discovered by two men in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been bought in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and sniffed in black plastic bags, along with a message. The second was tortured and was found in the streets of the Juárez settlement in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain his offer to reduce its greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at the COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and to transform its industry.
He concluded that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community on this matter.
He stated that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which contains the targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the federal authorities had worked with the central government and the municipalities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he explained that a number of multiannual plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional bulbs through energy-saving bulbs and another on the weakening and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, a scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much greater than generally accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China amount to six tonnes per person, while in the United States it was 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a 9% total contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 per cent over the last five years and is expected to take place by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion from Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party Chairman had the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right would give him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento had been right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to refer to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right would give him.
In an interview, which took place before the filing of the complaint, Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the Federal State, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Committee in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to refer to Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional through the way of appeal in his case in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidates had never been sitting at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The panistic leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, therefore "does not scare us internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best or best chairperson that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the fats "to those whom the Council would decide."
"I'm completely unsettled and open. I'd be proud to transfer to each of the Five the office of party president."
He predicted that the resurrection of the party during the last elections of July 4 would reflect in the next elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about assisting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore "very hopes and desires are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his four-year speech in his government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could make expressions like those he could make in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no mouth ban in this country and even less a censorship.
Obama is committed to the law in favour of undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on the Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you're for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of the Act," Obama tweeted.
Its short communication contains a cyberlink to a wider document that calls on the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was disseminated after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes in favour of each law, except the extension of the tax reductions from Bush's times and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a schedule could be drawn up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest of it," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize about 800 000 young people who entered the United States when they were not sixteen years old, while the last five years have lived in that country and have been registered in a higher education institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need 60 votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the sponsors of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn the initiative back.
Among the most encumbered Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past were Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust to the Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and used the subtitle of her question (on another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "provokes us in trouble," the Argentine writer spit sweetly to the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa first tells and is the protagonist who is looking for to learn what a "wait" is, and goes from a doctor to a doctor, who does not receive any answer, but she receives instructions for the guide to her story.
She believes the infectologists: "Path is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who took her breath in the middle of the gang, but who explains her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the mystery: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story is soothingly eased and concluded that "from the wound it only learned that it is really open and not exist." But it is convinced that the desire for the language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely story, which he called 'Lobby of Invention', and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound but is discovered.
With references to magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-reached men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and reported from America, the great novel, which did not miss his own Chronists from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spotted the fake witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imaginative power that even lost the feeling of shame."
However, he stresses, "is it the crazy and liars who imagine things best," and there reality and lies are approaching each other, where one no longer knows where the story belongs, where the fictive literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the run, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL to the round table 'The Finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentionally planned commitment," she said, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided, whose contribution also healed "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-live world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also go beyond dogmatism, and will forget, "that behind each confirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thought and reality, we need to nuance: and nuances often mean to put the finger in the wound and to trouble those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to trouble the mighty who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final game, two different styles, set by their respective trainers, are faced, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
With the medal to the second champion, the Argentinian left a step behind the winners and, as amazement, with the same team he played successive final games.
The Santist Stratege reached the first final game as a trainer at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the cliffs in hand with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a backshot again, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out indefinitely after 210 minutes of game, but at the eleven meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be chased again by the unfortunateness and free himself from the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens earlier is the most important," the taxman commented when he was asked about the lost final games.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures him of having learned much from it: "The only lesson that we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator doesn't pep the end, we can't celebrate, we're prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two eleven meters to quit, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is finished, there's no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by 11-meter shooting doesn't worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at 11-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense desire to hold the title in hand, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso's power not only to be the second champion, but also to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
USA changes the rules for receiving a visa
Persons must present themselves to the consulate at the visa application offices before they talk; the cost of waiting is reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the Embassy of the United States and in the Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves in the Consulate at the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the processing of the visa will decrease, since it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is provided.
The applicant shall make only one single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the countervalue of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa must not have a conversation in the consulate; they must only imagine themselves at the next ASC where they present their documents and their fingerprints.
Since biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for a visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the 26-dollar service fee.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, see: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in the universe.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) announces an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from astrobiology, which is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for alien life", which triggered speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that were previously considered inhabitable, human-like creatures can exist. It was raised the hypothesis that they could become intelligent living beings - like human beings - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all possible forms of life, since the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbial uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere are increased.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, "there is a real life form, a second life form that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency announces the actual range of its findings at the press conference tomorrow, on Thursday.
The conference is attended by Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and the Biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studyes Titan (the largest moon Saturns) in the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organic Law on the Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun and an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined themselves as an independent one, had already been set up.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo were fighting against the reform of the Organic Law before the opening of the 60th parliamentary session.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling the Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only members who voted against the Bureau chaired by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the schema, and that they would be based on their political will, and if they had not, they would be subjected again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were compliance with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in the Congress."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five members and speaks with other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT argued that the Congress has currently transformed itself into a 'stock' for two.
"Previously it was only a party, now they split these into two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to give them their place at the bargaining tables.
"The five, which are currently seen as split into different groups, have decided to join in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because due to the reform carried out and dated by the others, we have stayed outside and we are not in agreement with this reform."
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the electrical material company.
A further cheque on something more than 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This amounts to 1 200 000 pesos paid to the company's owner in the second half of the year.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued at 200.144.56 Peso was issued with the number 9258447 last November with the purpose of "clearing open bills".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already forwarded that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is monitored by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she was sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and consequently the number of cheques that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It was nothing bought from her, it's just paid the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal as required by law when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid that other administrations request their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be recovered.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the review of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers on July 25, it was known that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also business with Jumapam, where she received cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in the invasion of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay particular attention to areas in poor condition and to throw a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of Zona Dorada's Traders' Association, recalled that it was requested at various occasions to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and walkways had had a negative effect, as tourists would come to sneak and see the disorder, and then they would turn their back to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work slowly and unplannedly in this way."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist would have brought attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How should it do that? Well, by a preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afterhand," he said.
"We look forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we also residents have a right to a clean habitat. Urban administration has to change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that are also unfit and unfinished," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleanses its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly in fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents are just what is obvious for everyone: maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places to be brought to the foreman together with the city. The city to make clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned up and cleaned in order to make them attractive for tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that the MEPs should assume the great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 by PAN, three by Partido Nueva Alianza, two by PRD, one by PT, one by Convergencia and another by PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean work, feel committed to society and to the various social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Co-ordination Board of Entrepreneurs, suggested that the new MEPs should assume the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the MEPs will exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming them into carnival counterparts of the governors and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and, above all, work for society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the necessary importance to the government budget to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industrial industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is searched
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys, the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want to be enthusiastic.
For the parents it will be difficult to meet these wishes on the next three-king day, because the household is not more and not less than twelve persons and a goatbock.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give them the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes are hard times because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go to the street with the goats for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús Cayetana proposes one-year-old clothing.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster so much', but I answered him, 'Let us wait, boy', because it was very expensive," said Cayetana sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaac the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple of sizes 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help to realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Heilige König will be sought' by spending a toy or cash in the reception room of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the demolition of a cannabis production and sales network, the ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the main drug production had been served.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschisch, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two of the men considered to be the main drug wire of the ring came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have appeared hours after their arrest in Sherbrooke's judicial building.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a long-lasting investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Ruel.
Around the 70 police officers of the Estrian regional investigation unit of the Quebec security police, Sherbrooke police and Memphrémagog police had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be easily persecuted
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be stepped up after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly stand against this Charter."
"I am holding with a party that has put your feet on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting before the MEPs gathered.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows each person who comes from a sea ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to one year, violates the proposed Canadian Constitution for Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, Head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the bill because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will wait for what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has dismissed the critics who demand that their party did not stand up enough to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against blind passengers, and that is precisely what we are trying to implement by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because he seeks the guilt of refugees and keeps children in prison for at least one year," said Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the Canadian will.
"The Canadians strongly inform MEPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal events affecting Canada and treating the country as a footpath."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenney's response.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative said to the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opponent would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
In spite of the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and coalition by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea was not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It should be said that, despite the presence of Robert Dutils, this measure was not the least discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "a canine enchanted from the hat" and "a solution rightly based on a table end".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the questionable future unity.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he pleased to confirm.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer of ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this gap, he proposes to Quebec to grant financial auditing a special mandate to enable Quebec to carry out appropriate research through corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of auditing," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant audit control the same authority as Commissioners, which would allow them to commit people to their statements.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government drawers.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This request comes from the Supreme Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, in turn, confirmed his colleague from Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain new developments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several river runs remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has elapsed in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, on Wednesday afternoon there was an earthquake.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening another groundbreaking event took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has fallen together.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall has shed from 40 to 70 millilitres of rain in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimetres of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The northern areas of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimetres of rain.
In addition to these precipitations, the snow melting that has already been accumulated in certain sub-areas is feared to pass several watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings on the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The river runs in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has attracted the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a evacuation bridge was ripped up due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be alerted and monitors the situation most closely, says Security Council Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec High Water Centre, for its part, issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular from Machines, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
Quebec's radio moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial reluctance before the Canadian Radio Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as because of his pending speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that although Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own views, certain statements would have "inaccurate information on social care and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such unresolved speech that is inappropriate to broadcasts throughout the day".
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violated the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts broadcast in 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was filed as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Instead, the moderators should provide sound as misleading information.
With regard to the topic of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide was an expression of cowardlyness.
The majority of members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the mediated message was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the affected consequences of the "Dupont le midi" broadcast would have addressed a sensitive subject in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was no offense against his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had conducted a media-effective discussion in this regard that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated for Haiti's aid, because you wouldn't know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already lost my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board advocates the dissemination of an undisputed expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "in addition to its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which had, among other things, had to inform its decisions once during the main termination period within a three-day period, are minor.
A King of King Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Algerian Montreal, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now rises in the search for new challenges to the tatami and to the box rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports like Kung Fu and Kickboxes in Algeria 12 years ago," Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the struggle of all places, because for those who do not like the ground struggle, such as the mixed artes, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the person working as a security officer and employed in the company UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship of Amateures held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"For the time being, I prepare myself for the world pokal in San Shou, China."
"The fighters from each category were invited to be placed among the first four at the last world championship."
"I picked up babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"In 2005 I got back in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I became third in Toronto," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where flips and footsteps are allowed as well as ground throws.
The two fights usually play on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious box fighter, which has emerged from this kind of combat sport, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of combat arts.
If Nacer Zemmal kept only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the sympathic pound guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"That was a super-experience."
Ten times in the semifinal of his category (80kg) had won his first fight before he lost in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the front to crown a single champion, the king of King Fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has, in mutual agreement, approved $450 million of contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this lawn of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely the project management, to a total of 295 million dollars without a call for tender.
This consortium, known as "Energy gérance", was formed in 2004 as a accompanying event of Hydro-Québec's decision, the private sector's responsibility to overpay this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" signed the profitable contract without a public invitation to tender.
For the Québécois party, the use of corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition and increases prices.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and deters competition."
"This means that instead of playing cards, you are now in a secret manner," Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, explained yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the public's interest can be used in this way.
In the afternoon, the Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to it by saying in Abrede that this contract had been a game that had been a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered by strengthening that the PQ had been "unreasonable" and "missing her hardship".
She said it's "the minimum", that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on one bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its working size.
The construction process is in progress and is expected to be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition; negotiations had already been held.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects, is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium applied in the field of engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflow of the Quebec company register allows for more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works together with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozens, returns to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
With regard to the "Energy gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has taken into account this fact in a particular way since the 1970s".
Real Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has led the nose to the fact that the contract on project management was approved by agreement.
"If you make an alert and there are few candidates, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you, they will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract approved by the consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" had more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts which were awarded to companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts in itself, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Energy gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,44, including the contract with "Energy gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had declared that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had announced that the PQ was equally connected to the companies that she "financed" before she clarified that it was rather their leadership.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not credible
Greener, but unwavered, skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but not even in the labels or eco-labels to control his choice.
Shame, even though it baths in a media-efficient universe, where information in favour of a more responsible consumption is just so bad: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an insufficiency that reveals itself as a brake on his commitment, as shown by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population admits, in fact, to give little faith to the environmental commitment of companies as well as green business advertising, the instrument of measurement that is sophisticated by the responsible consumer centre at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates, which are supposed to be fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Information on responsible consumption seems, however, important for stimulating this consumer segment, which is currently driven by almost one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, the emptyness and doubtful nature of the information weakened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious about the stated performance of the green products and services that are attempted to help them.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to barometers, they had also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their district and promoted the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and responsible - the index of environmental consumption had reached 64 of the maximum of 100 this year - Quebec's homo consumus loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, social and environmental awareness seems to stop his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated, in 2010 used public transport or preferred the co-car centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The follow-up and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the clichés.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a seven million dollars donation from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to respond again to its actual cinestic function, do not seem to receive what they demanded.
Although the government has accepted to be involved in this matter, it has accepted its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a loan at a lower level than initially hoped, which could create a viable solution at beneficial conditions, at least according to the sources that can be removed from the state's rumour kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the bidt request has been redressed in sum since then again.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, head of the eXcentris file.
A few days ago he had given her a last factual report.
However, the counterproposal of the Cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to respond to these until 31 December.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have been really pushed to the side.
Let's remember that the Quebec community of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he had not allowed to provide to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained substantially of economic aid.
The film manager Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the rooms of his cinema complex in great difficulties after the self-financed design of the cinema for ten years, which could justify the exception of the public fund.
The lack of cinemas that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle at the top of Christian Yaccarini, for their part, manage a privately funded campaign from which they expect a sum of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not revoke the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignored what he and his group thought about the proposals that they made downwardly corrected.
Mystery of complexly shaken Canada ventilated
The new American diplomats, which were disseminated by WikiLeaks, ventilated the secret of what the United Nations thinks of under the Canadian inferiority complex to the Americans, but they open up the feeling of superiority to Canada with the same blow.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter does not have the meaning of Canadian-American relations during the election process, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disseminated yesterday, offer even more pikant details than the mere substantial content that you have to brittle on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period during which the federal election campaign was in full progress, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador set up in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various ways of explaining this situation.
"A low-value complex almost inhabited to Canadians may lead Canadian political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to the Black Peter in this election (as in 1988 during the free trade campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concluded, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "earing silence" less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the elector has in mind as a key factor in the process of urning."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, Managing Director in Ottawa, on January 22, 2009 to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government continues to vote for confidence in the federal budget in early February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, resulting from a boosting programme of $30 to $40 billion," Breese describes.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary meeting before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from falling from the coalition and having an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme by the opposition parties as a result of the continued existence of the opposition parties.
Another communication, dating from January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, agrees with Washington from the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast by CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle appeals to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or abductions for the purpose of hearings carried out by CIA muscle prots.
Another communication explains in detail how Hillary Clint asked at his first bilateral meeting with his French colleagues Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was willing to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he gave the State Secretary a paper about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to re-examine the file."
Finally, let us note that the minds are warming up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had said about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "surprised".
He referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
The United Nations in Cancun yesterday proposed a plan to renew lighting for households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (FCKWs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of CFCs released to the ground due to lighting if the white glowing pearls, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by lightdiodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to 70% of the exhaust gases of the world's fleet.
Last year, in Copenhagen, large emissions of gases such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it would be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilise the 2 degree Celsius climate increase from today to 2020 to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces light.
With the compact fluorescent boulders, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED boulders, this energy demand is reduced twice.
The compact luminous beams are between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED lights, such as those put on the market by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glossy birne, giving an indication of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new lamps give very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent beams have reserves because they contain mercury and that they have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless producers provide a place of acceptance.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal plants are producing 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report describes in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year when buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants whose construction in Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of election results excited
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "unimpeded" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Côte d'Ivoire immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press speaker of the UN Chief.
"He invites all parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibilities and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI on television had confirmed that the Commission would "continue" work in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara, who retired from the office.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraud" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, achieved by the ex-rebellion camp of the Forces Nouvelles (UN) during the failure of the coupe in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Côte d'Ivoire Presidency campaign, had confirmed that the UN practiced manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had discouraged the president's supporters to go to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the lawsuits filed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North, who dismisses any connection to the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in the proclamation of the election results as "inadmissible" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and submits a complaint to the Constitutional Court after the election commission has been prevented from publishing the results, be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the association and reconciliation process of a country which had been divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the politicians of the Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for any outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo held the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9,7 %) in the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the Metropole, according to the preliminary seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including the overseas departments.
Over the year the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In addition, 3.4 million French metropolitan workers were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find work, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the Metropole (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25%, including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed according to the IAA.
For their part, older people have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years of age had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to pursue this method and announced a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) on Tuesday, compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation process on public and fraud-reasoned markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with the bribery of social assets, the bribery of general goods, hedgeship, meditation in corruption, unauthorized bribery and arms ownership, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, rather than spread brain spins."
"It is easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the department, had valued sending a memo to the judge before he was heard by his lawyers.
A family member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to the lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keeping his deposition, which he had to lead.
Simon said he would never have known about the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday for oppression and complicity, but then re-enforced under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to explain the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more persons were charged and were released from detention on Tuesday's night on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to the Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne district, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one due to the title "Intrusion and disproportion of public property by an official of the public service", and the other due to "Parliament in disproportion of public funds".
The lifetime companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "Healing and Abuse of Society assets".
Among the people confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained for a similar case of fraudulent acts of public nature that had affected Corsica.
The flag suspected his company to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
It is clear from close sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the award and operation of a site in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Clotilde rice: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "Spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alarm and accentuated the worsening of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All of this under the attention of the U.S. diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans that went so far to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of "hospital" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not provide for the release of Majid Kakavand, a Iranian who was detained in France and sought by American justice for trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible to the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde rice, in a glossy light.
In truth, he had not done anything in this respect.
A diplomat telegram published in Paris on August 12, 2009 bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée adviser on strategy issues, spoke with Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They urged the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who would be violently detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulated loudly and clearly and without neglect" the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into embarrassment that is very sensitive to its image.
"Behave this the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "Shutlessness does not solve anything," past the attempts to discuss over inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in avoidance manoeuvres".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "hospital for political extortion".
He announces that the release of Clotilde rice from prison (which should be made on 16 August, on the day she flees to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that will "create itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde rice was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this worrying coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French ?
In a re-interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "soundly surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to resist.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "true" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée adviser selects a phone number, reinstalls, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde rice in Iran, the Elysée does not help to make its efforts to believe, through statements and media-organized "escape attempts", that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influencing middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from 25 August 2009 raises "the media flash of the French authorities".
On which is so much "Thanks" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
"Despite their praiseful statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then discusses the reasons for the Elysée to fail this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "prematurely and unforgettablely perceived by many critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian Role Building" attempts to show Paris "Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seed the dwarf between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier had entrusted her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée.
In a communication, he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the ash bread", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, states government officials.
A bill to call on online gambling operators to refuse access to these games for young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, painted representatives of ministers of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties learning at school and also having a normal day-to-day life."
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, a ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have had a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government also intends to ask manufacturers to cut down the daily time limit for access to these games to young people whose parents ask for it, added the responsible person.
It will also provide free programmes to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA nominates the country of publishing
The FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which ranking for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the Royal Discipline of FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Catar, Australia) in 2010, after the premiere on the African continent, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the extent of the economic and political involvement of a world championship.
So the creations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) documents offer more specific arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, which stood at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the weight of football, which was only allowed to carry out the World Championship once, namely 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had given him the food floor again by broadcasting a documentary report that fired three influential members of the Committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to piss the FIFA and embarrass the English responsible, who had conducted an intensive lobbying with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of his predecessor Tony Blair's chess track, which had achieved the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack drums with its already completed stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympics 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repression against the British and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the opportunities of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotels, transport), has become a major outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the Committee members should blame the unwavered impression of the repressions of the English press "a unfair competition in preparing the vote".
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, reinforced by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of benefits compared to Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem early for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the permit of the 2026 World Cup for China, which is expected by the FIFA, which will end the Asian opportunities in 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all records with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA pursued its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries posed a greater risk because of certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights accumulated by European countries (due to time shifts), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really stuck.
The middle edge had made him believe he punched.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current Head of State will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not the side of the mystery that is responsible for the presidential role.
So you have to pretend that there is doubt in the future.
On the one hand, as well as on the other.
In 2006, the followers Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without faith.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision "sometimes in the fall of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians he would make the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidateship?
Far missing.
The President reminded me only that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five years of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new thing in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the next phase."
His words from before yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the previous day, but not less.
Should they produce comments, then for a double reason.
Acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to manifest itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidateship in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS earlier than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer a candidate from François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it," immediately and cautiously responded to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found itself with the openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to emerge from the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy measures to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of European government debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt, without doubt, to have the opportunity to influence the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in favour of the resolution of European public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the Central Bank could do even more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchasing public bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the hearing of the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, the previous day in Brussels, had not expressed much interest in his intentions, but rather was pleased to point out that the programme of purchase of state papers on the secondary market would be "extended" and that we would see at the Assembly on Thursday "how decisions are to be taken".
The ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB has doubled the bond purchases of the Treasury Board to approximately EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to indiscretion of some dealers, it was supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese papers yesterday.
Overall, since May 2010, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
There is no doubt among the dealers about the prediction of a follow-up of the purchase price (see page 29).
The economy is no longer expecting a remarkable change in the course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months will have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will continue to create the full funds reserves in a freely available way over a period of one week to three months.
The economy is already committed to the extension of this measure by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will significantly amend its programme."
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," foretold Norbert Brems, Volkswirt bei Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB had to maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that stimulated the market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the relevance of the exposure of European banks to the markets of public debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must take place on the market at any price to replace the lack of investors and act so to prevent the fastest enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest countries," yesterday a major bondholder testified.
In fact, if the interest rates were to start to fly upwards, States would be even more prevented from reducing or stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi Government goes to Italy
After a weekly start for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the fall in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to cheating silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecisive" and heard him expect a "indecisive" weekend, but immediately demented the person concerned.
On Tuesday, however, the squeeze with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that Spain's disparity with the German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed its "heavy concern" about the "market turbulences" and a potential risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, sweeping tax inputs that threaten the state to be unable to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 will be expected... although the budget available at the Senate is expected to be 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (compared to 2.7%).
Therefore, the uprising of a new budget collection, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings measures need to be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The main festivals of Italy's economy are fine and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy by the IMF.
"There are currently no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), Italy is required to achieve less stability than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD's leader of the population.
Stay the question of political inconsistency.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be confronted with a motion of censure from the House of Members, which would allow the previous elections to be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anti-crisis measures
At a press conference in Paris yesterday, Christine Lagarde had explicitly emphasised this: "I believe it has been proven on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly holding together, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday on the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, a start to normalization cannot yet be mentioned.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May there is a real lack of clarity and political vigilance, which is particularly burdened on banking systems," says the opinion of the peoples of the Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, 'the political time goes much slower than the markets'.
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that it hides, intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and in the broader sense with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
This is also the case with the Eurogroups and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan is the loss of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the countries of the euro area in the cross of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicitly fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for it.
The first Werpapier expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the IMF fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the first-class countries, on their part, are engaging in structural reforms, in particular in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that will go to the savings measures, but which are intended to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other at all costs is to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budgetary corrections and decided on indispensable structural reforms that will bring them back to confidence.
In turn, European investors are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of public bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the passage to Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-take its own pocket.
Barclays Capital's nationals, with regard to the market for European debt, believe that an extension of EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, preferably in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This funding exists: the European financial stability mechanism, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
An advisory council that has all the chances of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions increase.
Snow and glaze ice: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow-episodes continue to create traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now at the orange alarm level due to the threat of snow and glaze risk.
The regions Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have added to the 20 departments already in orange alarm; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to the Weather France, the intense snow viewers swing the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow blankets are expected from 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is considerable enough to create barriers to traffic and to affect certain economic activities, says Weather France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tons are blocked, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac transport axes.
The transport situation of secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who are not advised to use their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been eliminated all day.
In Picardia, school traffic was abolished for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to remove 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport and 10% from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in south London and Edinburgh airports in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full progress, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the start of the SGP, the state has announced a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give on the markets a part of the financial sum to its double.
Today it has finally come to the first credits.
The supplementary budget for 2010, followed by the National Assembly Financial Commission this morning, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on the opening and the higher taxation of the offices at the Ile-de-France.
First, you can read article 15 of the bill, "in favour of the Public Law Institute Société du Grand Paris".
This is quoted: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it, to increase the product resulting from it and to rely on this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not quoted in the text.
Of the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is carried out that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation that is generated by the state and the Société du Grand Paris is gradually made for the project," explains the explanation.
In the SGP, this system is not found to be controversial.
"Since the moment when you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e.), you can cover projection for three years and then only build out of the 4 billion," explains.
"This is listed in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which will be able to look for four billions promised for a long time, is at risk of triggering a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revengeful hackers and emsious spies
The WikiLeaks business has a double meaning.
On one side, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of hypocriteity that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a presumption to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (a x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary" American disclosures about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do not throw anything more away than what one has been able to read over months in any x-any journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the horrifying cartoon profile Gaddafis has been offering cabaret artists material for a long time.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, not only this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to Esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (over the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosenkreuzers) exactly repeats what has already been written in previous works.
This is not just because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (not yet knowing where news about the non-existent would be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
And the secret records.
The informant is cowardly, and cowardly (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service ( otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy sent to the State Department in Rome, was the same as those that published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a resignation made about the disclosures of these files?
On one side, they say what each trained person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned, with the exception of some small representation tasks, into spy centers.
Every spectator of investigation films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen from hypocriticality that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that a x-what hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the significant blow against the prestige of the state district.
In addition, the scandal brings the victims less in trouble than the "scharfers".
But let us devote ourselves to the deep nature of what happened.
Previously, at Orwell's times, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one sees what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape from the control of a hacker, the control course ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the reproach of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secret, since it awards the public sphere; but to reveal in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this offense, which has been attributed to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer provide any reserved information online - that would be like a hanger attached to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is forgiven with the current technologies to hope to be able to keep confidential phone reports secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see it necessary to imagine the government agents moving in a secret way on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their messages anywhere other than in the mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe kit.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate's spying attempt had been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today the technology progresses like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for bands by swiping backwards and ventilating all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numbery) CDs today do not allow anything other than jumping from chapters to chapters, i.e. in macroportions.
With high-speed trains you can drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what kinds of secrets were swept between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France loves its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-solved funding promises (also called "short-starting" or early financing) that have been realised by the developing countries.
And the rough French speeches have already been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start funding: a detailed report of the Member States' action, a press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and valued to its actual value: developing countries and civil society would like to see if all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which brings it in the right way to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional use has been made without the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guide value that he considers best.
For example, the European Commission has identified itself as an indicative value for those of 2009: international funding is maintained and provides 150 million for the "Fast Start" funding for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar indicative values, either in respect of a year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the funding "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative values for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France states that it is committed to complying with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There is still no rule on this, and everyone chooses its calculation mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 loaned € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to understand: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often committed to emission control projects based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it is fraudulent to present the euro that is collected as equivalent to a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be charged as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following thinking: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking up EUR 91.5% loans (389.8 million) and spending EUR 8.5 million) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU in which loans are used to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (e.g.) meet their 100% commitments with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends €1 on fulfilling its commitments, France just gives 10 cents and understands a similar use.
Beautiful Hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial contribution.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be too much in UNFCCC's huge machinery.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Anyway, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year's early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of compensating justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, crucial and currently discussed subject): the question of "reasonability" or the type of accounting of its loans is not solved.
France could change its position in order to be as advanced as in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "predictability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international confidence base which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes up various chemicals over day 81, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of generations coming).
The association, which states that its results "represent no statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but represent the illustration character of the problem treated," had usually purchased foods consumed in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September, from about a ten-year-old child to meals.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been studied by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is low: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine disruptive factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in the approximating whole of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually consumed substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-provoking substances or substances with endocrinine disorder factor is alarming," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended for the study as an interim meal, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included at lunch, where the study has identified traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spiced.
In the pipeline water, the analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" of 34 chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer is likely to be "underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, on its part, proposed "in the light of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "creation of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
