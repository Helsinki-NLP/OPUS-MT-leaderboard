Changes in business aid practices - Province - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business support, national business support management will also be centralised from mid-September to four Ely Centres.
In Eastern Finland, the activity is responsible for the South Savo ely center in Mikkeli.
According to the new company aid law, which entered into force in July, the EU Structural Funds should no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is a whole new activity.
The subsidiaries of municipalities with more than five thousand inhabitants are also listed as large municipalities.
Instead, EU support will continue to be granted for investments that improve the conditions of the municipalities' business.
In Eastern Finland, the EU and national aid management unit will have a strength of about 30 people.
At least so far, they all continue to work in their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölöse, Head of the Structural Fund Unit of the Southern Savo Ely Centre, is in Joensu.
Researcher: Russia is now trying to do this in Ukraine
Russia works consistently, even if it doesn't always look like it.
Chief of the Department of Defence High School Strategy, Colonel, Docteur Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting Ukraine news of Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its scooter forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmations (read more here).
Mr Lavrov insisted that the Minsk negotiations should bring about an immediate fire break without any conditions.
Russia contests its involvement and must immediately get the outcome of the negotiations in order to establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: we need to start negotiating quickly, and precisely so that Russia gets its own control over the areas of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair externalizes cabin services to Norwegian company, vacations people
Finnair starts buying cabin services from the Norwegian crew service company from OSM Aviation.
The agreement concerns the routes in Hong Kong and Singapore at first stage, but it is intended to be extended later.
In Finland, the two-way outlet results in a total reduction of about a hundred years of work, which will be carried out at the first stage by holidays, the company reported in its newsletter.
In addition, the work of some 80 Asian tenants will end at the time the routes are being extinguished.
Finnair already told in June that it intends to externalize approximately 20 routes of passenger cabin services over the next two years.
Outsourcing ended when there was no agreement with staff on savings.
The outbursts are scheduled to begin next year in January to March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also be continued with other partner candidates.
According to the study, Union problems multiply the risk of nervous spinal pain, i.e. stroke pain, in those who work hard.
The Labour Health Agency's research followed firemen for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders to the Ice Pain must be surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good musculoskeletal strength and durability of firemen, which are regularly tested, does not seem to protect from pain, says the research manager, the doser Sirpa Lusa in the Labour Health Department’s bulletin.
Firemen's work is an irregular shift, where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the Ministry of Occupational Health, Union problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on the survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you feel the surprising new causes of water damage?
Easily causing destruction to other dwellings
Water damages Water damage is not always caused by a leaking pipe or hemp," reminds the expert of the hosting association.
We have been contacted when the breach of the aquarium has caused damage to the water company that it is possible to deny the aquariums, says the law expert Marina Furuhjelm.
Furjölm reminds us that only pipes and sewers are not common causes of water damage, but today more and more new machines, such as ice breakers, have caused water leaks in the dwellings.
Many do not know that machines such as the washing machine or the washing machine must not be uncontrolled.
The water handle must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the pipes can lead to a leakage of water.
The resident may be considered guilty of carelessness if these obligations have been neglected, resulting in the liability of the resident for damages.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for damage, depending on the conditions and the case of the insurance.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused harm by carelessness, there is a liability for the resident.
If the resident has turned off on the floor vessel, failure can often be witnessed because in these cases water has generally flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes to an apartment where an outlawed resident is found.
Furuhelm tells me that due to the occurrence of the extinguishing of the floor mines, many student apartments have now been installed in two floor mines in shower rooms.
Water damages have also caused water beds, although no longer to the extent that they were more popular.
Even the dog’s cup of water and the fall of home wine can become real water damage.
I also know the case where there were many cats in the apartment that had pissed on the ladder so that there were large damages, says Furuhjelm.
The principle of repair liability always goes in the same way if the company's company's statute does not prescribe otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of surface material and for the damage to the structure and other housing.
Water damage easily causes damage to other apartments, because the concrete structure is really easy to absorb water.
According to the Furry, the leakage of the apartments is particularly difficult, because the batteries are easily leaking into the structures.
Water damages can now be caused by generalised air heat pumps that produce condensed water.
Water should lead to solid sewers or to a rainwater network, not just to a barrel.
The partner also has the responsibility to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, the legal expert advises.
For example, although the rules of the house company do not require a flat-drop hose of the washing machine, the insurance may be subject to a condition for which compensation is not granted.
You should be careful with your own terms of home insurance.
However, I consider the disconnection of washing machines, for example, of water removal pipes derived into a bathtub, a major risk that has caused many damages.
I recommend that the discharge waters should always be led firmly to the sewer pipe.
Snow and water removal on the balcony
Control of washing machine, washing machine, etc., when they are on.
Close water handles (dishwasher and dishwasher)
Cleaning of the floor vessel in visible parts twice in six months.
The recommendation is to connect the wastewater to the sewers firmly.
Check the hens and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experiences in the commentary?
FC Honka lost again and illuminated as a serial goddamn
At the Tapioola sports park on Sunday night, two of the weakest teams in this moment were encountered at the gymnastics club.
In June, the last victory celebrated by FC Honka hosted seven games in the unwinning pipeline of Vasan Palloseura.
VPS just received his previous victory in Honka in July.
The meeting with the Espoo team on Sunday came into a good sleeve, because VPS returned to the payroll for a long time, reading 2-1.
Prior to the game, Vasa's main coach Olli Huttunen complained about the inefficiency of his team, but the mixed Honka defense facilitated VPS's painting problems.
It's a very nervous performance.
We couldn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't keep the ball," Huttunen evaluates their own performance.
In the first half of the time, Hong Kong's top taxi Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played really uncertainly.
Both Vaasans paints were born as a result of the loose play of the top players.
The opening hall of the match was only seen after five minutes of the game when Steven Morrissey directed Sebastian Strandvall's shot by the foolish Honka Guard Walter Viitan.
I'm sorry for the first half of the time.
By the way, the team did the contrary of what was agreed before the game," Hong's main coach Shefki Kuqi managed.
After the initial shock, the Espools got their game together and rounded the ball at the head of the attack.
Especially the midfield player Carlos Portela and the attacker Roni Porokara were enthusiastically looking for places to do, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly bad.
The nearest goal was Hong Kong's middlefield man, Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre shot, however, was slightly past the VPS paint.
The VPS hit effectively using its fast attackers and Honga's crazy top pair.
In half an hour, the Vaasans made a 2-0 hit when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through alone.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good game head during the opening period and created situations on the left side repeatedly.
Stewart's speed again seemed to be too much for Espoo defense.
"I cried half-time, that if we lose, then we lose with honor," Kuqi told.
Inspired by Honka, during the second period, he was rageous to apply for a depletion painting.
The team was twice close to hits until the third attempt succeeded.
The attacker Yerai Vilaboa finalized the goal in the middle of the penalty area.
After Vilaboa goal, Hong Kong had half an hour to compensate for the match.
The Espoo team took more risks all the time, giving VPS the opportunity to take dangerous counter-attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were able to come back with Viitala, but the Honka Guard's rays kept the home team involved in the game.
At the end, Honka was a little tired and didn't get any extra paints.
As a result of the killing, Honka turned out to be the last member of the Wraith League, when there are still seven matches left.
Newspaper: Putin threatened to take Kiev in two weeks
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite hard-speaking in a phone discussion with the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, says the Italian La Repubblica.
Mr Putin expressed his irritation over the European Union's plans to extort sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica says Putin said.
According to the paper, the message from Putin to Barroso was this: it is not worth annoying Russia with new sanctions.
Putin interviewed the Russian television channel 1 on the Ukraine crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said in the interview that he considered the conflict entirely within Ukraine and urged the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the fire in East Ukraine.
Russia "can't look by the side" if people are shot to death from the nearest distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The work of the actor destroyed the family
Hard work The Konkar-Actor and the theater family raised to recognize how the actor's profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actress Esko Roine will be 70 years old next Friday, but I think she's in the case of a saying that age is just a number.
I don't notice any difference compared to a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine's been retired for years, but he's still working for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was joked that in this country there were no many plays without Esko Roinetta.
Roinee currently plays a role in the Helsinki City Interess drama How to Success in Business, Tampere Workers' Theatre's Plotsman and Tampere's Comedia Theatre Quartet.
Roine will also be seen in the coming Risto Rappapper movie.
Photo: Reijo Hietanen
The King's actress career didn't start promisingly.
I didn't fit in a funeral picture at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said that I was so bad.
Esko Roine wasn't disappointed.
The choice of career was clear. There was no choice.
It felt close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and went to a volunteer army just to try to get to the theatre school as quickly as possible.
Roine has made about 200 plays and 300 TV shows a little depending on how to calculate.
If it's counted like Englishman, that every part of the TV series is their own show, then there's more than 600 TV stuff.
I was three years in the New Day, which was done for three episodes a week.
Last spring, I was killed when I had no time to do it.
Commitments in autumn 2016
The Esko's big sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full attack and do the Tampere Workers theater Still in a play that takes the gorgeous roles in anarchism.
The little brother's still on stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
You always have to make a little reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
Calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
It's been years to leave the man behind, too.
Age's not coming alone.
The knees are operated, the hip whispered, and the arthritis is troubled, but when you don't let it get too disturbed, you'll get these heads, Esko Roine says.
Roine became acquainted with the TV audience.
From the pirate radio, and a show with Antti Einio, where he distributed hundreds of cents of banknotes.
It was Antti Einiö who shared hundreds.
I tried to thirst that they were hundreds and not hundreds.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was an insignificant Lieutenant Eisenkallio.
He became the favorite policeman in Tampere, at the department when it happened that he was in the same position as a detective.
A policeman stopped the car on the street, pulled the window open and screamed to me, "The Iron Curtain is great!"
Working Group Successful
From the theatre work, Roine's mind has been left, for example.
Producer and Master Class of Helsinki City Intester, Death of Tampere Workers' Theatre Commercial Passenger and Trip to Tampere's Long-Day Theatre at night.
All are related to the fact that the presentations have been popular.
It's not for me, it's the team that's been successful.
It's been rimanials, too.
The role of Pekka Puppa in the movie is one of those.
There's more.
The reason is that I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome isn't me or the viewers satisfying.
As a liner, you can't choose your own job.
It's just kindly done what's ordered.
Besides the theater work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It didn't make any sense when I tried to be the director of the Tampere Theatre at the same time, an actress and then a restaurant editor.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it became clear that these cannot be reconciled.
Typically, when the show was at the end or in the middle of the day and I had time to think about whether I would put on the sauna, the restaurant came to call that there were your friends here who hoped to see you after the show.
Memories for Birthday
On the birthday of Esko Roine, memories appear as ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of bow they've made a face-twister's memory.
Sometime in Zoom, when I was playing, they called me a face-provoker.
They didn't feel like I was.
The book has been made for years.
Once Roine told me that there's no news bomb on the floor because she hasn't done anything so bad, or if she does, you don't tell me.
I made a little first sentence in the book.
I'm saying that if someone is waiting for skandal rays or good rags, you should stop reading here.
There's a lot of work in there, as an actress as a theater leader.
The publisher is keen that there is also a turmoil for an unpleasant theater school time.
It was a pretty normal student life, but it was a kid who made all sorts of tricks.
It wasn't as ugly as it was at Turkey's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much I got from there but self-confidence that when the school has gone it knows that it doesn't at least depend on it if it doesn't improve.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I had gone to school.
Roine also remembers National Theatre legends.
I was friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrise and got to work with them.
Yes, there were legends from my first stepfather, Kaarlo Halttus.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him at school.
The middle boy of the fire, Martti, was on the same course with me.
At the theatre school Roine met her first wife Marjukka Halttuse.
As a painful thing, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long fight, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to my mother and son.
I didn't think it was a good solution, and I think the children are pretty much in agreement now as adults.
It's not rare in the theatre that silver is distributed.
In the case of me, some part was that I worked pretty much at the time.
I was at the theater almost all the time.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I spent a long day and a family life suffered.
On the day of the party, maybe the night of the holiday.
Esko Roine celebrates at the Tampere Workers theater at the Condoleant 7 September.
The celebration will continue at the Helsinki City Institute on 21 and 28 September.
I'm sorry, too.
I was 50 at work and 60 at work.
When such an easy - to - move play happened, I thought that then, even the seventy - seven, they would be removed with one rhythm.
The King says there's no festivities on the real birthday.
I remember it's free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I might've done some work for that day.
Or it's weird for the night I'm going to take the night off, Roine says.
Air companies concerned about the production chain
Some of the smaller UK aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the problems in the manufacturing of the supply chain may hinder the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In the UK, thousands of aircraft production companies currently enjoy the unexpected number of aircraft and engine deficiency plans to be carried out.
Aviation and defence
At the same time, while some enjoy the order sum, there have been warnings on the capacity and price problems in the production chain.
"It is absolutely true that there is a price approach, especially now that the production volume poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, CEO of MB Aerospace, among the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, Managing Director of the North West Aerospace Alliance, representing the supplier of aircraft in the northwestern England, more capacity is needed.
"Are strategies and investment plans in line with these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure about it.
First of all, we need more investment in new production equipment and machines that are needed to carry out these production volumes," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft construction is part of the problem.
According to JJ Chrurchilli’s CEO, who produces gas turbines, Andrew Churchill, the company has a "demanding time" when several new construction plans started to be implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
We moved from very small production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterward, and we had to try to push forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing GBP 800 000 in new machines and by hiring 26 new employees.
Several stakeholders believe that more investment and coordination of small suppliers are needed if the United Kingdom wants to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
Ford Aerospace and Tyneside Fine Mechanical Engineer Geoff Ford say that the order sum should increase the confidence of producers and want to expand and increase production capacity, as the work will be sufficient.
"If this doesn't happen, we lose in the competition against other countries," Ford says.
Some major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The FTSE 250 aircraft and engine parts manufacturer Senior purchased UPECA’s parts in Malaysia for 75 million pounds.
Last year, MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland.
"It is possible to buy new business start-ups, but in reality the most slow-down design limitations and the number of engineers," says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned their prices, which have shifted from major aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of operators in the production chain are exaggerated.
Mr Marcus Bryson, Director of the GKN Aircraft Manufacturing Unit, who also operates as a representative of British Aircraft Trade, is of the opinion of the President of the ADS that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There's pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"Beyond the volumes, the introduction of new technology and advanced processes is more important," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from errors and are now more cautious so that the building volumes are not increased too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it was faced with great difficulties when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, Head of the Rolls Royce Aircraft Manufacturing Unit, says that the company has not yet faced any problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18 000 parts required for the production of the engine.
"It will certainly be a hole, but we believe that we have done more thorough work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and by keeping contact with suppliers while preparing for more activities," says Wood.
According to the CEO of Boeing, James McNerney, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling of the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly with journalists, which is very important.
The Managing Director of the Airbus Passenger Showers Unit, Fabrice Brégier, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines per month by 2018.
"Maybe one of the journalists will not succeed, and our task is to try to prevent this situation as well as supporting journalists and looking for options, but it is waiting for great problems," Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for sins: "The quality of the product is the responsibility of the main editor.
So this is my and Airbus' work."
Hong Kong’s protest groups start "the era of national disobedience" in Beijing’s language open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Democracy-supporting activists are spreading to Hong Kong’s streets after the demands for their open elections have been rejected by China.
The Hong Kong Democracy Groups emphasise that demonstrations can stamp and swear to ensure that the city begins the "time of disobedience" in order to resist the reforms proposed by the Chinese government on the elections.
Thousands of protesters robbed the coming rain against the glorious horizon of Hong Kong when they walked to the protest of the Occupy Central Group in front of the Council for Law Enforcement on Sunday night, in which they urged people to participate in a large session in order to depress the city's financial card.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it denied the right of voters to propose candidates publicly at the 2017 City Presidential Elections, thus threatening months of expressions that further increase the city's two-way division.
In front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong, the protest of the Occupy Central will be launched.
"We want fair and decent elections," says 24-year-old website maintainer Dion Tse, who participated in a demonstration on Sunday with her 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect the Hong Kong voice.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
The Chinese People's Congress adopted plans for election changes to allow only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the proposal requires the approval of the 1200-century Appointment Committee, which, in the opinion of opposition politicians, effectively prevents the participation of a different political viewpointer in the election flags.
In the context of the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, the protesters take part in the protest that was conducted in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
According to police estimates, more than 2,600 people were currently involved in the expression.
A large number of cops followed when about 100 demonstrators led by the Scholarism student group gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where the Communist Party member Li Fein was supposed to stay overnight after his arrival in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, participated in a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order not to comply with the law, the exact date when blocking the roads is being implemented, but urged the participants to closely monitor the development of the situation in "the next few weeks" while adding that the city is officially shifting to "the era of national disobedience".
Benny Or answer the press's questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at the demonstration on Sunday in front of the advertisement board of two standings in China representing disobedience.
That man takes control of the center with you!
The 17-year-old meeting of Scholarism Joshua Wong earlier said that the preparations for high school students’ demonstrations are underway and are designed to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their minds by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, the Vice-General of the Congress of the People's Party, Li Fei, told journalists that defending the "international requirements" of the general right of vote is "timeless" and originated from some Hong Kong politicians who "strive to mix society and lead it to misleading".
"Inpractical proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, demanding that the electoral method should be created in such a way that it is compatible with the real situation and the legal framework of each society.
The draft legislation on general voting rights can only be adopted if a large majority, or two thirds of the 70-person legislative body in Hong Kong, supports the fact that 27 members of the government of the opposition can stop the initiative.
Mr Li warned that Hong Kong could be dragged into a prolonged political debate if the reform proposal was rejected under veto law.
"It would affect business and city development," he says.
Nearly 800 000 people voted in an informal survey organised by the Occupy Central in June to object to the demands of China, which states that the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Up to 172,000 people marched on behalf of democracy on 1 July, at the same time as on 17 August, the Beijing-supporting and Opposing the Occupy Central march attracted about 88 000 participants. Estimates of the figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although the estimates of police and organizers differ considerably from those figures.
Three injured lightning strikes on the New York beach
In a lightning attack on a New York beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire station, men were injured on Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay in the Bronx on Sunday night when the heavy storms passed across the area.
The wounded men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning hit when the heavy storms wiped over the city.
The storm rains, the thunderstorm and the lightning of the Lab Day were interrupted by the celebration of the weekend and the U.S. Open race in Queens, and forced the music festival to close early on on East River Island.
Ten commercial flights to city airports were late due to bad weather.
The new idea should not be pleasant
This is the latest guide for network users to employees and managers, and it is shared by the author Harvey Schachter of the Monday Morning Manager website.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, the good idea is to identify comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
Unless so, the idea is probably popular and clear – so boring and everyday – or the benefits that it brings with it are so small that it is not worth achieving them.
As a history scientist, Drew Gilpin at Harvard never repeated anything that had already been published so that people wouldn't think he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as a university director, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message would be widely understood.
Ad Consultant Bob Hoffman thinks TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read news from the network does not mean that the Internet would be good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad choice for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson says that there is one word to motivate workers: together.
In a study, participants were told that they solved the problem in cooperation, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than those who were not told about the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a recurrent pattern or relationship between two units, the performance expert Dave Paradi advises to forget about Microsoft SmartArt and instead use the Diagrammer.com program, which can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart Hospital Prohibitions due to a security risk
The special doctor has been temporarily dismissed, and the British national health system NHS ceased to direct patients to the private hospital after the hospital problems emerged.
Two people applied to the Torbay Hospital after being in charge at the Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that it has been associated with 19 patients on 26 July and has called them "unanimity clinical trial".
The Mount Stuart hospital regretted the matter and said that it had begun to be investigated after the doctor was taken off.
This came to the attention of the Torbay Hospital when two patients treated at Mount Stuart were seeking the first aid because of eye problems.
According to the Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, all investigated on the same day, had to be remedied.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District have not directed patients to treatment since the emergence of the problems of Mount Stuart.
President David Sinclair of the South Devon Healthcare Foundation, head of the Torbay Hospital, said: "We have identified the problem at the beginning and we have been able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the service provider, we carry out quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legislative requirements and that its licensing matters are in order.
According to Gill Gant, Head of Health Care in South Devon and Torbay, “the safety of patients is always at absolute level, so it is important that these noise attacks are not carried out until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe.”
The Ramsay Health Care UK company, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, "warrantly apologize to all patients with complications".
The company was announced that "on the moment we learned about the possible problem, we and later Torbay Hospital were called to all the patients in question".
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date, he has carried out 4,537 cross-sections of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he has carried out have been excellent and the percentage of complications has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily dismissed until the matter has been investigated.
What's "4chan"?
The badly anonymous communication site published first celebrities leaked naked pictures
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the first option of the hacker when he published stolen pictures?
"4chan" was established in 2003. It has been a debated communication site, which is called as much as it is praised.
The site is divided into a number of sections, so-called notification tables, which allow anonymous users to discuss everything possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other web forums, users do not create a profile that is constantly used and their publications are not preserved.
In the most popular notice tables, comments may disappear in less than a minute when newer publications cut them off at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchistic and surprising creative atmosphere in "4chan".
Anonymous community members have created some of the most famous members of the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the website has also led to the fact that the website has a lot of questionable or actually criminal content.
The most popular notification table on the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and for which NSFW content is regularly published (Not Safe For Work).
This may contain summer porn, but also raw and shocking pictures. The anonymous hacker published the famous stolen pictures on this announcement board in the weekend.
American CytRx invests in research and development of anticancer medicines
The aim of the CytRx company is to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company that produces biological medicines in Los Angeles, which recently became subject to an increase in sales of shares, specializes in research and development of anticancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldoxorubicin, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx is conducting clinical trials with aldoxorubicins of soft tissue carcinoma, Kapos sarcoma associated with AIDS and recurrent glioblastoma or brain tumour.
It's like a controlled missile that passes directly into the tumour and not into the other body, says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx from Aldoxorubicin.
Aldoxorubicin contains so-called unit technology that works like a trojan horse.
It is bound directly in the blood to protein, which is also collected to tumours, which means that the medicine flows directly into cancer cells.
I united to give the medicine only in an acidic environment, i.e. in cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to be given more and more doses of the anticancer medicine.
"It's like a missile that goes directly into the tumour and not into the other body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of the CytRx company.
Like many other biotechnology companies focusing on the development of medicines, CytRx does not make profits.
This year, the company sold shares and thus collected $86 million for the maintenance and research of operations.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for a critical 3-phase clinical trial of alternative treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
The soft tissue fracture is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as in the blood vessels, muscles and fat tissues.
Alternative treatment is used for cancer treatment when original treatment does not result in results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply for authorisation from the U.S. Food and Medicinal Products Management Branch already in 2016, Kriegsman says.
The medicinal product could then be authorised for use in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published by CytRx in December from the previous clinical trial showed that aldoxorubicin was a promising treatment for soft tissue scrubs.
"For a long time the question was: "We haven't seen clinical information how different it is from the medicine itself," says H.C. Wainwright & Co. investor analyst Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
Fein, however, says that it is difficult to predict the results and timetable of the current clinical study, as it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"Many things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines to the mining industry.
"In the first place, a lot of money is invested in finding that one golden cup, and the investment will continue as long as my gold cup is found," he says.
The money is spent on research and development so long that the medicine can be marketed.
Several shareholders have called for the CytRx company to be brought to justice because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the case of claims, the company was accused of hired by the DreamTeam Group, which then claimed to hire people to write positive comments on the CytRx company and the other biotechnology company in articles such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the claims, the articles did not reveal that companies paid awards to writers.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that he had deleted the articles "which were contrary to practice".
Several companies were also removed from other websites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the charges.
The company has hired an external lawyer to answer the claims.
"I don't have time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to work in biotechnology centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways wilderness from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Analyst's views
The price of the shares of CytRx rose to $8.08 on January 10, and then fell to less than $3 in April when the charges for advertising of the shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, claims and negative publicity have lowered the price of the shares than their actual value.
"It's regrettable," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there is any easy way to miss this matter as long as the idea is valid."
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of the descriptions
The photographer of the Act series based on real events, also presented in Finland, died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident.
The cameraman photographed the shooting between the suspect when he was hit by the bullets.
He died of the injuries he had.
According to the TMZ site, the police reported that a person who was suspected of a armed robbery died in the shooting incident, in addition to a cameraman.
The first series of real TV programmes in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an external factor arises in a crucial role in the court trial of Ulvila's death today.
Anneli Auer is charged with the murder of her husband, Jukka S. Lahde, in 2006.
The Court of Justice of Vaasa is now dealing with the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the court with new evidence.
The purpose of the Court of Justice is that the judgment will still be issued on the side of this year.
The Court of Justice of Vaasa released Auer in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an external factor to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, prosecutor Kalle Kulmala told me about the prosecutor’s view of the night of murder and the facts that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether an outsider has come to the house, who has killed Jukka Lahden Anneli Auer in a way and in time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the Church began a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek divorce.
At some point, we moved to the kitchen where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to stop this from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen towel," the corner described the events of the death night on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, a number of things prove that there was no outsider.
For example, the emergency call device does not include voices from an external factor.
Auer's oldest child, daughter, told me in the interrogation that he saw the perpetrator when the man left the door of the wardrobe.
The vaasa court judgment in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, the observation of the daughter cannot be true.
"The daughter didn't see an external maker in the parents' bedroom, even though she went there twice watching," Kulmala said.
The prosecutor's new witness is just related to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahde's sister has told me about the events since the night of murder in the hospital.
According to a woman, the daughter told me in the hospital that she only saw Lahti's body when she was at the killer's place in the wardrobe.
Auer's defence intends to present a legal investigation line, which, according to the defense, has not been sufficiently investigated by the police.
When the Court of Justice of Vaasa released Auer three years ago from the charges, the court considered the strange man's DNA found in the throat as one of the references to an outsider.
The sample later proved to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
At the time, 700 people took DNA samples as a mass sample.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded", said the defendant Juha Manner.
One of the new witnesses of the defense tells us about a possible outsider.
The U.S. woman told the police about a pornist man who, according to a woman, had confessed the act.
The police interrogated the man in the summer.
The prosecutor made a decision that a pornist has nothing to do with a life crime.
The prosecutor made an inquiry on a woman, because the prosecutor suspects that she was lying in her report.
One of the new Witnesses in the defense is a nurse who worked the night of death at the Satakunta Central Hospital.
A hundred-century court sentenced Auer to lifetime imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice, there were wars against the possibility of an outsider, among other things, the reports of Auer's children, the voices of an outsider from the emergency centre record, and the time required by the events.
The sentence came with 2-1 votes.
The judge in the minority wrote that conflicting evidence in the criminal case must be interpreted for the benefit of the accused.
Therefore, the report of the daughter must be interpreted in such a way that, despite the contradictions in the report, it had found that the outsider had left the door of the locker room.
The two oldest children of Auer have been called for court hearing.
The daughter was first personally heard last year in Satakunta District Court.
He didn't remember what happened in the night of murder.
Auer's second oldest child named his mother as a killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the murder night events behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
As the owner of the case, the boy has no obligation to pronounce anything in court.
The court proceedings will continue today with Anneli Auer's hearing.
If necessary, the hearing of Auer will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently sitting in prison for more than seven years for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to participate in the G20?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him a number of first enemy.
Putin is expected to participate in the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is discussing whether or not his entry should be allowed or not.
The Punkrock Activist Group Pussy Riot called for Australia to ban the participation of Putin at the summit, involving more than 4,000 representatives of the world’s most influential states.
"This person does not have anything to do with the G20 meeting," Maria Alyokhina said to the audience in a full-packed opera house in Sydney during the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiova has warned that he is on the edge of the "perfect war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossi" or "new Russia". So is it necessary to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said he's weighing the decision.
According to Mike Callaghan, Director of the G20 Research Centre of Lowy Institute, Australians cannot decide who to participate in the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Austria can decide who it will let down, but it is an international meeting," he says.
Just as in the UN hosts of New York or Washington hosts of the International Monetary Fund, "the host's task is not to ban anyone called from coming," Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said "weighing the decision" after the disgusting actions of Russia in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
As Putin is coming to an extremely important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on it alone.
"However, it is important that I will weigh a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so in the next few weeks," he says.
People participate in the anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, East Ukraine.
The event takes two days and involves a wide range of representatives of the world's largest and fastest developing economies, living around two thirds of the world's people, representing 85 per cent of global GDP and 75 per cent of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few specially invited guests from non-G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a questionable task to balance various interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the best way for the Prime Minister to deal with the matter is to take advantage of the opportunity to press Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to use this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, his duty is to give an account of his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly a rise in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world expects them to talk about these things.
Russian rebels are preparing weapons for the attack on the Ukrainian military base at Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Put is taking part in the meeting, and Callaghan says that this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in the mind of Putin.
He hardly notes that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
President of the opposition Bill Shorten views Putin's arrival in Australia "very reservational", but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Heads of State and Foreign Affairs to discuss with other countries and the G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events that followed Malaysian Airlines, as well as the lack of sympathy, responsibility and decent cooperation in connection with a flight accident, and now, as thousands of Russian soldiers bargain at the border with Ukraine, I believe that most Australians are very reservational to welcome Putin to Australia.
Germany's business world criticizes Berlin's "self-sufficient"
Some of Germany's top entrepreneurial leaders warn that Germany has become "too reliable" and "ego-sufficient" because government policy threatens the competitiveness achieved by the country's efforts.
The criticism of the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is at the same time when the largest economy in Europe shows signs of slowdown, which raises concerns about whether it is able to drive economic growth in the euro area.
The criticism of corporate managers is the result of political decisions strongly opposed by the German business sector, including the introduction of minimum wages and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term workers for 63 years.
"I think the greatest threat is now too much trust in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-sufficiency," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world's largest chemical manufacturer.
EU economy
He feels this: "Generally speaking, there is a feeling that we are doing well, we have money for use and unemployment at a relatively low level, so what is the problem?"
I think there is a great danger here.
The German government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not a favourable environment for companies, but we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German Industry Association, "German situation is now good.
In the next ten years, however, every developed economy will have to change. ...[Germany] the reform programme will not make as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce, DIHK, has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and even the slowdown in consumption is growing again.
However, the second quarter of GDP has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2 per cent over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
The weakened performance of Germany threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation more difficult and may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "go from public consumption back to public investment", for example by focusing on the increase in future consumption on infrastructure rather than on pensions.
Mr Kerber believes that the Merkel government will destroy the fruits of his social-democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder in the early 21st century with rigorous policies.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, Managing Director of the Family Enterprise Foundation, "Germany's situation is still good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to businesses and not even government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Neighbourhood France's example has shown that the use of funds for social assistance and the restriction of the freedom of business management is a wrong way of doing so.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more directly, saying that the government's recent decisions are "disaster".
Germany threatens to lose everything that it has done so much work for, just to please the voters.
This is now my main concern," says the banker.
According to Mr Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to resolve the fundamental weaknesses of policy which have caused industrial costs to undermine competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher with music festivals, prevented by security officers from accessing a fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach Canary Music Festival in Indio, California, where he was told to have had a dispute with a strict security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is told to fight with a securityman at the cantrimus festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the backstage at the Stagecoach Canary Music Festival in California, after which the situation was robbed by hands, the TMZ site tells.
Kutcher was in VIP when a young woman approached her to greet and hand her.
When the star of the "Menpuoliks" series went to greet the fan, the super-enthusiastic securityman went between and caused a sniff.
The actor and securityman ran into a grip, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to stop Kutcher, says TMZ.
After his ex-wife, Demi Moore Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who is like Kutcher's former 70's show stars.
Soon after Angus T. Jones had practically been removed from a set of hits from the standard actors card, he published a video in which he calls the series "chuck" and urges the fans not to look at it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher is taking part in the Stagecoach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the series "chuckle" and urges people not to look.
The Baltic's bacteria killed a vacationer
The bacteria from the Caribbean, placed in a popular German tourist destination, have been infected by six people.
One of the sick is in a coma.
The Vibrio Vulnificus bacteria are found in parts of the Baltic Sea and in other parts of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria spread the most effectively in more than 20 degrees of breakwater.
"The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Agency for Health and Security of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (LAGuS) told The Local.
The bacteria can be found in Denmark, Poland and along the coast of Germany.
According to LAGuS, the sick person had been on vacation on Usedom Island at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his legs must be shot.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop, a little wound in his leg.
The sick man went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his leg has turned blue.
The doctors found a blood poison caused by Vibrio vulnificus at the leg.
"My husband would not have spent time in the Baltic Sea if he had known the danger," said the sick wife Sonja Bruehl to the Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious disease and the damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and the family could have been avoided if the information had been better available.
LAGuS told the dpa news office that doctors were advised the following infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official information was provided.
Cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"[Manantain] test results showed that the stock of V. vulnificus has declined significantly," says Dr. Will.
It's cool weather.
Vibrio vulnificus, a parent of a cholera bacteria, is particularly dangerous in patients with chronic liver disease and impaired immune response, such as HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
Men's risk of disease is greater than women because oestrogen has been observed to protect from pathogens.
If a bacteria gets ill, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
After the bacteria's injury, the probability of death is approximately 25%.
V. vulnificus may also be infected by eating marine life that it contaminates, although Dr. Will says that in these cases it is not infectible.
Contamination of foods from the sea is more common in the southern half of the ball.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died.
Vinno Kekkonen: The chest was removed due to cancer suspicion
The 80-year-old revelation singer Vino Kekkonen works and exercises hard, but has also had to fear for his health.
I can't believe that the radiant Vinno Kekkonen is 80 years old.
He himself is astonished at how many years of age there may be suddenly.
I didn't realize I was so old.
80 years sounds so much, Vinno Kekkonen laughs.
Her birthday, Vino Kekkonen spends with her family.
At the end of August, a birthday celebration was held for him by the People's Music and Pensionary Association in Karttula, where he lived in his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, at the same place my grandfather was born.
I was totally disturbed by the party, the birthday hero tells me about the occasion in which the three hundred-cent stage was filled with congratulations.
A few days later, Muhokse was gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers having followed as a young man.
And now we're both ages of this!
Vinno Kekkonen is laughing.
During their long career there are only few sides of Vino Kekkose that have not been seen in public.
One thing he has never told in public before: in 2006, another breast was removed from him.
There was an unclear discovery in my chest in such a point that it was decided to remove it completely.
Then it wasn't cancer at last, which of course I was happy of.
There was a new chest in the same operation, so it was a very big measure.
Vinno Kekkonen has not thought that he has lost his own chest in a way in vain, because the information about the unclear finding would have been a heavy stance and cannot be missed.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vinno Kekkonen tells and notes that the loss of my own breast is certainly more difficult for younger people.

The farmer is being made guilty of the sea’s state
The debate on the poor state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically intentional opinions.
In particular, during the summer, the Helsinki News and the Yle have continued the responsibility for agriculture for food emissions into the Baltic Sea.
At the same time, rapid action has been required to eradicate emissions.
The average farmer influences a few environmental researchers and with their help as compared with experienced suppliers from a superior nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that no nutrient drainage can come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients has been sowed into the field as the harvest is carried out.
In Finland, almost all farms have committed themselves to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires careful monitoring and reporting to the nutritional balance.
The authorities monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been rinsed into water after draining restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for years.
Farmers have the will and willingness to continue to work to reduce food emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero level is impossible.
"If we want to have a quantity of agricultural production equivalent to consumption, we must only accept that this is the case," says Jyrki Aakkula, Director of MTT's Environmental Research (MT 29.8.).
The past summer brought large blue folks to the Gulf of Finland.
Scientists were quite unanimity about the growth power of the rest of the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
Phosphor stored in the bottom of the sea is part of the farming of the past decades of coastal states, but it alone does not explain stocks.
The cleansing of the wastewater of the growing cities of the Baltic Sea was on the reef until the end of the 1900s.
The problem also concerned the waste water of Helsinki and was not seen as a problem as regards the pollution of its own beaches.
Pollution of beaches was prevented by building a wastewater pipe in the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of the water that is directed there has improved over the years.
The nutrients that ended up in the sea in the past will not be removed, even if agriculture would be completely discontinued from Finland.
Nevertheless, every summer's blue-winding debate and the accusations presented are always directed towards agriculture today.
The public debate marks the farmer's guilt for the Baltic Sea.
The charge is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to implement political passions.
The Greens are driving major changes to the environmental standards of agriculture under the leadership of their chairman, Mr Ville Niinisto.
As a pressing board, sociistö has used the summer resting debate.
It has very much said that it has accused the producer's association of interests of MTK of being old and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
Some limit should be on political rhetoric, too.
Most specific water protection projects are based specifically on cooperation between MTC, farmers and environmental management.
An attacking style of the societ serves more to fish for urban green voices than to protect waters.
I think that's the point.
In hard talks, the Greens are prepared to leave the government.
In the context of political changes, the MTK is responsible for ensuring the success of its members.
It is difficult to sell expensive changes for farmers unless there is a substitute for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is cuts from other agricultural funds.
Repealing the mining tax is not going through: Palmer
The last attempt by Abbott's government to throw the mining tax in the garbage basket seems to be devastating, because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the government has included in the new initiative a rule to limit employers' increases to compulsory pension contributions until 2034.
On Monday, the government used a qualified majority in the House of Parliament to hurry through the process of annulment in the power of general confusion and in the face of a clear enrage of the Labour Party.
It put aside the original revocation initiative, which had previously been substantially changed by the Senate, and replaced it with a new legislative proposal, which it described primarily in relation to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Initially, it was an initiative aimed at repealing the "failed" mining tax and other decisions, such as a low-income pension fee ($3.6 billion savings), a earnings support bonus ($1.3 billion) and a school-aged bonus ($4.7 billion).
The leader of the Palmer United Party (PUP) Clive Palmer did not accept the government transfer.
"The poorly planned mining tax revocation initiative is not accepted in the Senate without a pension fee for low-income workers, a pay-back bonus and a bonus for school-age children," he tweeted.
The government needs support from independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not object to the initiative in the Senate.
Mr Bowen, the shadow finance minister, blamed the government for trying to remove the power of Parliament to decide on the compulsory amount of pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance all the decision-making powers.
"This is unprecedented," he said to the journalists in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay further increases, with the target of 12% of the pension contributions guaranteed by the Labour Party moving even to 2034.
"It is in no way acceptable, and the Labour Party will of course resist with all means," says Bowen.
The guarantee is now 9.5 per cent, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future additions.
The man's body found on the Brighton beach
The Sussex police picked up the unidentified man's body before the waters of two afternoons, and the police closed the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist sight.
The police and the death scientist are working to figure out the conditions under which the body was found on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers will review the list of missing persons to determine whether missing persons have contact with the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, an accidentally occurring explosion at the border was one death victim.
According to the police of Piedras Negras, the accidental explosion in the customs building at the border of Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas operates as the operational leader of the local police of the city border with Texas.
He told the Associated Press news office that the woman who died of the explosion on Sunday had headaches and five other fire injuries.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred in customs officers' nights in the morning.
The cause of the explosion is being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion has resulted from the accumulation of gases.
The explosion didn't affect border security.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
Man's client plays at Showboat Casino, which is intended to close his door, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
The month of September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City in the state of New Jersey, which means, at the same time, that this neon-light, well-known metropolis of money machines can no longer count on gambling revenues.
More than 5,000 employees are unemployed when Showboat and Revel casinos are closed this weekend, the Associated Press news office told me.
There will be more unemployed people when Trump Plaza turns their lights off.
Three casinos, one of which had been operating for only two years, the expected closure of the city is the last disaster after the Atlantic Club’s story ended only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice to Atlantic City, the AP news office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has received a lot more competitors when the casinos in New York, Delawaren and Pennsylvania block a large part of Atlantic City once so huge casino gains.
Even previously opposed to gambling, Massachusetts looks at its own share of the amount of money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule difficult to accept
According to the Power of Industry (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by the company supplier Areva that the Olkiluo's third reactor is only commercially available in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction works are already largely ready and the number of work in progress is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the data received from Areva.
In the press release, Mr Silvenno notes that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with the updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 that three-reactor construction works will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva Bulletin, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of the reactor automation systems, which was obtained in April.
Four years before this, negotiations with TVO took place.
Olkiluoto 3 was originally scheduled to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been delayed once after another.
TVO and Areva have been fighting for years for who is responsible for delay.
It is disputed by a court of arbitration in which Areva has demanded compensation from TVO of EUR 2.7 billion.
TVO, for its part, considers the requirements of Areva unfounded and demands about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water operators is needed in the face of global challenges
Today, international leaders met in Stockholm in the context of the 24th International Water Week, calling on energy and water operators to cooperate to meet the greatest challenges we have in our time, to ensure sufficient water and energy production for the growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storage, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it affects the other immediately.
These two funds are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, who organised the Water Week, said at the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are enormous".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to grow by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore there is urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water operators to find solutions that will enable all peoples in the world to flourish.
This year, Professor John Briscoe described the water as a basis for growth that needs both society as a whole and other sectors. Briscoe said that "developing countries face great challenges.
They must mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that "[the water crisis] there is no permanent solution anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
During the week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during over 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King of Sweden, Charles XVI Kustasta, in the Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research information and provides information to decision-makers so that they can make sound decisions for water and sustainable development.
Exploration of dead alien bodies home in Miami: Costs of expedition of dead aliens
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees transported a ship to Miami fell, and 14 people were reported to have died.
The same has happened to hundreds of years ago, and this certainly was not the last of its quality.
Every year, more than 1,000 Central American immigrants die when attempting illegally to cross the U.S. border.
Because of the first city, we're ready to die.
It is, however, ironic that, after reaching the first city in the country, few are planning to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, pressure board upwards or a time-catering place while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they're dying there, and when death is approaching, many plan to return to their homeland.
In popular cities of migrants, there is a disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily residing in the country and death and return to the country of residence are continuing to work.
It is estimated that 20% of the dead in the South of Florida are flying elsewhere, and that is more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human residues (HR, the short form of the professional slang of words of human residues) are shipped to the home country from Miami International Airport.
From 1964 onwards, according to the CEO of Pierson, the largest company in the sector, approximately 80% of this traffic is being transported abroad. The company is flying bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, the return home has its costs.
Miami is the main airport of the American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures in the table describe the remains of humans that the airline has returned to the country of origin in 2013.
The return of bodies to the homeland is not cheap: prices can vary from $5 to $100 thousand.
The religious, cultural and public health requirements related to the flight and delivery of human residues also vary.
Migrant communities in popular cities sometimes organise funeral communities to help them with their costs, because returning bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process and the dead are often young people who have no insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance schemes have been created in the past from such communities that were founded by the Italian, Jewish and Greek residents in New York, the first groups of immigrants in the United States.
The new generations of Mexican, Chinese, Philippines and Bangladeshian immigrants now operate the same in many of their popular cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, because few people who move abroad plan to make the settlement city their last restor.
For example, in Dubai, without a will for dead foreigners, the Sharia Act is respected, even if the laws governing the inheritance of a dead country would be different.
The entire property of the dead will be frozen, then distributed in accordance with the Sharia Court decision.
A network of human residue transporting the Aer Lingus airline as its central location in Dublin (
2013) reflects the multicultural demographic structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline interrupted the service, but re-started it in 2004, after receiving negative feedback from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when a man passes through a city that is preferred by the immigrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to the migrant city is an open declaration of the way the migrant sees life, not death.
However, death in a city of migrants abroad means making the most powerful and irreversible decisions for an immigrant — decisions whether to belong to a local or global community, the universe or the country, short-term or eternal.
The Centre and the Left Association make a matter of inequality
The opposition parties in the centre and the Left Union intend to make an interim question to the government about the survival of small incomes and the growth of inequalities.
The parties want to raise the debate on people's livelihood problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
There is also a growing inequality between the various parts of the country and within large cities, the parties comment in their press release.
The government's next year budget will focus on cuts and tax increases, according to the parties, on low incomes, such as students, unemployed and retired, family and ordinary workers, while food, medicines and housing continue to be costly.
In reality, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their press release.
The livelihoods of workers have also increased.
The Parliamentary groups of the Centre and the Left Union will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The Third Opposition Party of the Basic Finns has previously announced that they will leave an interim question on the resources of the police and internal security.
Parliament's September part-session begins tomorrow Tuesday.
New York City West Indian Day Paradise will soon begin
The Caribbean culture will return to the light in New York City, where the West Indian Day Paradise is one of the largest outdoor events of the year, and there politicians will see each other and be seen.
The annual paradise will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It depicts the celebrations of the carnivals prior to the traditional fasting, and some of them are dancers who wear complex, often sealed clothing.
The president of the Brooklyn region Eric Adams is the festival champion this year, but there are also many other faces known for politics.
Paradise is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to greet the audience a week before the pre-election.
Despite celebrities, violence has also been involved in the end of the paraphrase in recent years.
The police have said they are trying to keep the event safe through additional measures, including monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Would you like to ask some rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, right?
That question should not be answered.
This language picture, which is a question that is not expected to answer, but which suggests a certain answer, tastes both high-air speeches and more daily exchange of words.
The original words of Ciceron's famous Catilina accusation are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, are you going to use our patience?"
The same applies to the questions that my wife asked: "Why shouldn't I heat the kids five days old chickens?"
Why are you so tense?
The distinction is a nicer word for the rhetorical question.
The strength of the rhetorical issue lies in the openness of the question and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
Confusedly, the rhetorical question suggests that no full sense could agree.
In the 1800s, the writer David Williams described the question of the rhetoric as "one of the demonstrated words that are admirably designed to produce a strong feeling of something about the truth, and at the same time the challenge they pose is inadmissible to disagree".
Tampering Skills
Rhetorical questions can be asked in a postposture if they want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several subsequent rhetorical questions, designed to express grief or anger, are called epiples.
Job, for example, uses them when he appeals to the Almighty: "What benefit do you have from oppressing me?"
Do you have the same eyes as ours?
Do you see the same way man sees?
The chains of rhetorical questions are also found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you crazy?
You can't do anything right?
In addition, there is also a so-called hypophora, which is the case when a question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex monster for all women?
Parru!
True mooses!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
Add more examples from my wife, "What is the only food that the children have eaten, and from where they may have suffered?"
This chicken.
Who's the idiot who fed it to them?
You.
Wonderfully, the rhetorical question does not usually try to conspire, even though rhetoric means conspiracy skills.
If you are trying to talk to someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already turned out to be stubborn, you should use rhetorical questions with a sparseness.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one another to accept his own opinion.
If the audience agrees with the claim "Isn't it nice when it's so sunny outside?", the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of his assertion, which makes the speaker and the audience better bound together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
Assuming unanimity has been achieved instead of seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-sufficient.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weakness of argumentation.
In the titles of the magazines, the rhetorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in the very weak case: "Did aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a danger that the question may lead to an answer which differs from that suggested.
"Do you think the same as we?" was part of the British Conservative Party's risky campaign statement in the general elections in 2005.
The party lost.
Some such cases have become an hobby, and the so-called QTWAIN questions (the British journalist John Rentoul's known concept Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions with no answer) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition for best examples.
The competition clearly won the song "Do You Want to Be In My Gang?" singed by Popstar Gary Glitter before she became a sexual abuser of children.
The writer has also written the book "You Talkin' to Us?"
Researcher: Federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal state could be some kind of compromise on the conflict, says the island.
In an interview with the Russian Channel, Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said that the establishment of peace in Eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of people living in the east.
According to the island, Ukraine's transformation into a federal state is a priority for Russia in a certain way.
Ukraine certainly has reason to doubt that Russia would thereby seek to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If the federal solution could not be reached, another option could be, from the Russian point of view, some kind of frozen conflict where Russia would practically control Luhanski and Donetski, the island assesses.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has challenged the claims, even though, for example, Russian rebels have themselves said that among them they have fought "free, voluntary Russian soldiers".
Director of Upi: A Powerful Mission Planned for Kata
The tiilikainen reminds us that the picture of the action is new and is still being designed.
He said that the idea was that Katainen would, in some way, coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment issues.
Of course, one of the Commission's priorities for the new period of the programme is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
Tiilikainen believes that Kataise's background, economic knowledge and role in the course of the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to have a good position within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be unpublished, i.e., Katailla would not have its own Directorate-General.
On the other hand, Kata would be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment field, where he could have other portfolios related to the sector, in addition to the Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
In practice, management of the team could mean, for example, design and guidance.
Mums of soldiers: in Ukraine up to 15,000 Russian soldiers
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organisation, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine over the past two months, and there are currently more than 7 000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the hospital near the border of Ukraine, Rostov City, is full of wounded in the war of Ukraine.
The mothers of the soldiers collect their information from their own soldiers.
NATO has estimated that there are over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte about his alcoholic use: "A little drink after a drink will come up with a story"
Big brother Jussi and Andte drove on Monday night to consider the life of the BB house.
On Monday night, Jussi, who was on the basement, walked on a fitness bike with the Ande of the residents of the Kartano.
The twin wondered what they were doing in the view of the program.
Not that way until you've seen it, Andte said.
Jussi believes that most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or missions are only a break-up part of the BB house's life.
It's more of it, and we wonder, we talk and live.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of the Kartano spent the night in wet marks, and especially alcohol was brought on to Ande's phone.
Jussi asked Andtle if the party had made a man’s life more meaningful in the house now that he had been able to talk to them with the other inhabitants.
Take a little drink, and then there'll be a case, Andte admits.
Look at Ande's interview on the ISTV video!
Let Abreu reveal his body hands in We Women
Anna Abreu tells us in the "We Women" magazine that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she stayed at the concert break.
At that time, the tired Anna thought she would get more energy with the loss.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Anna dreamed a couple of years ago about the type of crow of Victoria's Secret models.
My body glove was like the Victoria's Secret model.
I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight, Anna tells the newspaper.
Anna, a performer of her body with gigs and music videos, says he's not a lustreener, even though he's named like that.
Export the Kytöjoki
Anna in Timm is training at the gym and is doing boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I get a certain amount of weight in the gym, let me point out.
Sometimes the pop star allows himself to taste.
If I delicate, I really delicate.
Sometimes I'm pulling out unhealthy overheads, and I'm not wondering if there were more pounds.
Instead, I'm thinking about what my body thinks.
I'm disgusting if I do something bad to my throat.

Anna says she's enjoying the chrome.
The profit distribution of companies pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Are the leaders of the Australian stock exchange companies today just trying to favour a large crowd by giving the shareholders the hopes of a greater distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power in transition from corporate governments to shareholders served by the government?
The distribution of profits is the most important, shown last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of the shares of companies that have rewarded investors in the form of re-purchase programmes and through the distribution of more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is declining faster than the analysis has predicted, which makes many ask whether over-weighted short-term preference is being placed and whether the focus is sufficiently focused on the near future and long-term growth.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
For example, more funding is obtained from cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this is reasonable because the loan is currently cheap, while capital is not.
However, even if the funds obtained from the loan market were not taken into account, it is clear that generosity towards shareholders is financed primarily by the fact that the company uses less money to invest.
The net result of this purchasing programme wave (and the cancellation of profit investment plans) is a reduction in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period a "capacity depreciation period" during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the recovery programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of the expected unrealised capital acquisition programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it sees the consumption of capital as a curse in a headline of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has existed for months.
Glenn Stevens, head of the Australian Central Bank, thought it was enough to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "fighting spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects of individual companies, but rather about the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital consumption usually leads to negative effects on economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "the own estimates of the consumption of their capital by reporting companies have fallen by an average of 4% over the past two years.
Estimates of the volumes of free cash flow have risen by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This rapid look seems good from the point of view of the current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of evidence of obedience to companies.
If I get the coin every time the CEO has said that the short-term price of the stock is not important, I'd... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this claim is not true.
Executive directors are very closely following the prices of the shares and are very concerned about price changes.
The short and long-term bonus packages of the managing directors are defined by the value of the shares, and the position of the directors depends on them.
The Executive Directors would like to say that some decisions (or business sales, increased investment in organisation or profit sharing) are not necessarily immediately recommended, but are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, managers often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach to investment markets.
Therefore, the current effort of conservativeness seems to be a commitment to the short-term objectives.
However, it was too clear for those who assessed the cheap stock market and supported the savings of capital that there was no concern, but at the end of the reporting period it was too clear that the weight was on reducing the consumption of future capital, and the most saving companies were encouraged.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the first in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also act the same way — part of the obligation and part of the fear of the shareholders’ reaction.
Then why are investors pressing companies to share profit?
According to the Credit Suisse strategyman Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more revenue, since the profits of other, more traditional fixed-win investment products have declined when, as a surprise, the central banks have calculated interest rates worldwide to produce more money on the market.
In this way, investors are forced to seek profits on the capital market and, in turn, they are pressing companies to share more profits.
The shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer the money at the same time as more and more investors approach the retirement age.
Statistics from the previous reporting period clearly show that the profit distribution had a significant impact on corporate cost cuts rather than on the increase in turnover.
Cases of leakage of celebrity nasty images appear to be an intrusion or an e-mail account
Jennifer Lawrence's pictures and some sources show that a unknown hacker has leaked videos on the internet astonished by data security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female publicity in one chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of the illustrated have reported that their pictures are fake, while others have said that it was pictures removed long ago.
There's a lot of pictures and there's been a number of people who have been told to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the most important question is how the attack was done.
And were the pictures and videos authentic and where were they loaded?
The most important source of images in the news – an unshamed and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service – is the most unlikely option.
Apple-like large companies have invested in inside-house data security teams, whose task is to try to intrude regularly in the company's own systems.
"A large scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim is true," notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Trend Micro IT Research Unit.
The simpler and more likely explanation of hacks related to these publicity individuals (and of hacks involving less famous people every day) is the leaking of an e-mail address and password, either by guessing or fishing information, i.e. by deceiving the person to log in to a genuinely-looking site, then using this information against them.
Apple will continue to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used on the iPhone phone to save settings and, above all, the backup of images when transferred to the cloud server.
The user account can be logged in in the iCloud service by giving this e-mail address and password, then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step identification ("two factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. an additional protection against entry into the account, in which case a code is sent to the account owner's mobile phone before you can log in.
However, relatively few use the 2FA feature either because it is not known, or because it is considered difficult.
Apple will continue to examine whether all the information is derived from its iCloud service, and if so, how extensively the user's accounts were invaded.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this issue at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forgot password" link in Apple's iCloud service by collecting the e-mail addresses of individuals, for example from the address book of the second hacked device.
It is also possible that the celebrities have used the same password in several services, thereby capturing passwords through them.
Lawrence's picture publisher claims that the pictures are real, but don't tell me when they're taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a terrible effort.
I feel sympathy for all the others who have been hacked," he wrote in his tweets.
However, the independent information security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have believed that he has removed the images from his mobile phone, but the removal of the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Today’s smartphones regularly record images in the cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones save images to OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic images and data storage services.
"Humans take and remove pictures, but don't understand that pictures are loaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "The pressed does not always mean the erased," he says.
Pictures and videos can be kept for years.
If someone gets access to the user's e-mail address and password, he can reload all the images and videos sent by email.
Apple service images can be downloaded for Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was alleged to show up videos and images taken from Windows PC, unpublished so far.
Two-step identification protects against such hacking because it requires all those who try to copy an existing account to another device to give the original user device, usually the code sent to the mobile phone.
Without a code, access to the account is prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo provide two-step identification to the account, but yet it is not known whether the public service was used by those individuals or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures they claim to be are not authentic.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the images in which Grande is claimed to be are "completionally fake".
Victoria Justice wrote in his tweets: "I think the naken pictures that I have taken are Wrong, you don't understand.
Let me break the shouts from the roots right to the beginning.
Cluley's giving us another option.
Because the hacking was the subject of publicity, their accounts could have broken into someone who handled their social media accounts or regularly handled their emails.
"I would like to know whether the actors' agents or some representative are involved," he wonders.
However, these publicity persons do not use one publisher or agent.
The second option is that someone who installed or helped configure a security attack victim's one or more systems, and changed the system secretly so that all the information can be returned.
This happened in the case of the Floridian Christopher Chaney, where the hacker spread pictures from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunisi's e-mail accounts in 2011, and he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of invading more than 50 people in the entertainment industry's e-mail accounts secretly between November 2010 and October 2011. In some cases, she asked Aguiler for pictures of the star in the name of the stylist, and then published them online.
Chaney later apologizes, saying that his actions were "uncertainly one of the worst insults of privacy that can be imagined."
Chaney was also claimed to spy two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Chaney, Stars' e-mail accounts were broken and changed so that someone sent their information forward also after changing their password."
Cluley says that the obsessive activity of hackers breaking into these accounts "remembers the collection of butterflies."
They just want to collect such information.
It is possible that in this case someone had encountered information and login information on these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
The hackers have also been trying to intrude for a long time.
or they got access to any e-mail account information, such as the address book, and then fished the information of other persons.
I don't think it would be a simple iCloud security gap.
Australia has provided its intelligence service to help the United Nations track 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by terrorists in Al-Qaeda in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusran is believed to hold 44 Fiji peacekeepers in prison, and this terrorist group conquered the crossing site on the Golan hills last week and forced the UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there is no information about their location.
At the same time, the Ministers participating in the UN Small Developing Island Conference, including the Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about the events.
Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General Banki-Moon at the summit and has provided Australia with help to save the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured that Australia will help the UN wherever you can, by providing, inter alia, intelligence assistance," he said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We keep very close contact with all the contacts and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already convinced the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, and the Foreign Minister, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Filipino peacekeeper group held in its military armies was reported to have escaped from the same controversial area.
The UN has overseeed Golan's hills since the fire break in Syria and Israel in 1974.
Trotkers are trying to steal your money by using the carbon tax waiver initiative, warn Australian Competition Authority ACCC
The fraudulents use the carbon tax revocation initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch Unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses to trust the government agencies' too good-hearing offers that offer compensation for thousands of dollars.
Trotkers may use the media figures to prove to the consumer how much he can save on buying goods after the revocation of the carbon tax and offering him up to $7,000, says the warning.
The fraud may sound very convincing because they have investigated the victim’s personal information that they use in trying to get bank information or in trying to get the victim to pay the reward.
They're discussing topical issues to cheat on the victim.
They use non-carbon fraud to access money, and their stories are more developed, and they use current things to build a fraud around them.
The missing plane and the death of Robin Williams on the MH370 flight from Malaysia Airlines have also inspired fraud.
The ACCC advises to contact the company by means of the contact information itself, instead of the contact information provided by the caller, if there is minimal suspicion of the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or e-mail from someone who claims to represent the government agency or company, such as the energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the carbon tax, be careful.
If you think you've been cheated and given personal information or transferred money to the cheater's account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money shared by the government — it is likely.
Economic messages: Lipponen blames the EU’s Russian sanctions
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticizes the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia in the interview with economic messages.
Russia's priority in politics is to drive its own interests.
This is not necessarily the effect of sanctions," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started his work as an explorator of the business of the Arctic Regions of the Economic Central Union of the EC.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have suspended Russia's project funding as part of the EU's economic burden.
"It means, for example, that environmental projects of the Northern Dimension, with clear views, go to ice", says Lipponen in the interview.
The freezing of funding now hampers cooperation which, according to Lippose, may be difficult to rebuild if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in co-operation projects in the Ice Sea region will continue as much as previously.
He is currently studying the Arctic policy of Finland and the opportunities of businesses in the north.
This does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report looks far forward, talks about ten years," he says.
It is rare that the norp gets into low water or close to housing, says Naturtopedagogy Vesa Heinonen Northeastern Museum Reading Centre.
On Sunday at Vasa Suvilahde, a cliff was seen swimming near the beach.
According to Heinose, the norp is likely to have come after the food of the Suvilate.
It's not messed up.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinone's tip.
He says, for example, that the Sundom Bridge is especially seen in the spring and autumn of the Norwegian, which arrives precisely after the fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Vasa Sea area.
We'll see the Norv at the frontiers of the villas, he'll continue.
Norppia lives in the North Sea and the Saarvik Sea, among other things.
According to the South Australian Court, a pizzeriano killer Robert Vallelonga acted aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
Murdered a South Australian pizzeriano artist Robert Vallelonga.
The court's hearing has found that the pizzeriano artist Robert Vallelonga was acting aggressively against both his partner and the security officer just minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers charged with the killing of Vallelonga asked at the lower court of Adelai to release their client against guarantees because it was "clear" for self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to hold her client, whose identity has not been published, behind the trial.
"According to the evidence, the dead acted so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, the sniff started, and then that 40-year-old drunken man... broke the securityman's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, death caused one blow, which clearly refers to self-defense or another's defence.
A 25-year-old man is only accused of killing.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconsciously near the crossing of Rundle St and Synagogue Place on about 2.25 May 4. He had serious head injuries.
He died of his injuries at the Royal Hospital of Adela early the next day. Friends and pizzeria customers remained to mourn the "local legend of One Tree Hill".
According to the prosecutors, there was no reason for the murder of the accused, and after the case, he had told the taxi driver "he had put someone to sleep for a few days".
But the security camera video now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead acted aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his own part of the hard and violent behaviour," he says.
Our client has both a presumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors objected to the release of the man, because only one of the three security officers who were in the turmoil night had intervened in Vallelonga's behaviour.
According to them, other security officers did not consider him a threat because "he was short," and he used a big man's vocabulary, because he wanted to avoid physical congestion.
They said that, too, the case clearly seen by the taxi driver would prove that Vallelonga was "powerfully beaten," he had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be arrested until the next week he would declare his decision.
The disputed dolphin hunt began in Japan - based on tradition - Outward news - Night Messages
The bad weather was expected to delay the start of the widespread chasing in the world.
In the Japanese city of Taij, the annual dolphin hunting season began again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
Abundant opposition to the hunts worldwide is reported by British Guardian, among others.
In hunting, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote bay, where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable individuals have been selected to be transported to dolphinaries and theme plants around the world.
Delphin meat also ends up as food.
However, according to the local authorities, the start of hunting was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
The information on the practice was disseminated to the world through a documentary film called The Cove in 2009.
During the previous hunting seasons, the hunting has criticised not only animal protectors but also diplomats.
According to the opponents, the dolphin meat is in any case a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to the Japanese government, the hunting defenders are a tradition.
The defenders have also reminded us that the dolphins are not threatened.
Delfine hunting was already resisted by demonstrations in several countries during the weekend.
According to Protestants in Tokyo, the hunt will damage Japan's reputation in the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some NATO Member States are uncertain about the investment of new troops in Eastern Europe
The military union within the NATO will share views on whether to establish NATO bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States as a response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the Military Union to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraina has given a new perspective on Russia's policy, which threatens to undermine European security," said the director of the Royal United Services Institute of London, Michael Clarke Financial Times.
NATO Member States will be meeting in a week, and the Military Union will publish its new preparedness plan.
The main question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the TAE Agreement signed in 1990.
That is where NATO and the Warsaw League agree how they place armed forces in the area between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains.
According to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military support in Eastern Europe and the Baltic.
Russia itself freeze its participation in the agreement in 2007, but it did not actually resign from the agreement.
As a result of the tension in Ukraine, NATO is wondering whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"The NATO's resources must be available in all the NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, President of the British Parliament's Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller flew the youngest in the world
When other teenagers learned to drive a car, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
19-year-old Guthmiller was just the youngest in the world – and still alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young person in the state of South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, 23 times 15 in five different continents.
On a trip, Guthmiller was treated as a rock star thanks to his record air performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "somebody silly, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Mr Guthmiller did not have much to say to the speakers of such comments.
Of course I had a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that with my record I will also encourage other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight starts when he was young, and he first asked his parents to go to the airport cafés.
Later, he called for flight hours.
My parents let me go on a short, 20-dollar, 20-minute flight of acquaintance, but I think they thought at that time that my enthusiasm would end.
He didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon thereafter made a contract with his parents to give him more time in the steering room.
I agreed to share my father's car all the high school time instead of having my own car.
In the exchange shop, I could fly airplanes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight licence and two years later he added a single-engine Beechcraft plane for his single flight around the world.
A young man studying at the MIT University took care of the maintenance of the aircraft and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the high mail also meant that he himself needed a further test.
practically a lot of coffee and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he had eaten a few biscuits completely during a long flight.
Flying to the clouds was both great and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no regulations to help him navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane, and which of them were 45 000 feet high and cut into pieces of the plane.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressured and had no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly over the clouds.
The fuel volume of the machine would not have been higher.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman died after his plane dropped on a flight between Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his journey the most difficult part.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he considered the rise phase technically challenging due to the high amount of fuel required for 16 hours of flight.
However, despite the risks and even the high level, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for ATK training through the Code.org website.
He's himself a coder, and he founded his own company at the age of 12 years.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
Well, it would be great to set up the next Apple, but let's see how it's going to happen.
Well, in any case, Guthmiller's going to target the high.
Target the sky and you can achieve something great.
It's harder to find a real franchise entrepreneur than you think.
Lori Joyce was thrilled by the fans in the line of his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the Canadian W-TV channel began to show the Cupcake Girls TV program in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
"My Francoise entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers would run outside the store ready to buy a cupcake and he couldn't stand the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes, because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the selection process of franchise partners to emphasise the management skills of the company's culture rather than baking skills.
"Everyone can shine in the interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, "and he added that he has held about 100 interviews for each 11 franchise movement.
We start with six weeks of training, but the workers themselves operate completely differently in the working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult. Therefore, we stress the relevance of training for business culture.
Finding a real franchise entrepreneur is vital to the development of any small company.
A strong and honest director is able to edit and educate the organization, while a poorly suited manager can cause expensive damage to the company.
"Before I thought that looking for a franchise entrepreneur is like having a date, but it isn't true at all, during the date you can do a lot to get to know another before you get married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a contract will be signed, a security will be obtained and a new store will be built.
Engaging in partnership with someone before you see how the person works is a huge step and a significant test of confidence.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchise partners resembles strong marriage, as they have common objectives, explains Lorraine McLachlan, President and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan also believes that the franchise entrepreneur should be careful when choosing the future franchise provider before entering such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as for human relations: if a date partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he is in marriage?", he says.
It is equally important for both parties to carefully select and assess the future contracting partner and to draw attention to the smallest alarm signals from both sides.
McLachlan adds that franchise donors like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time the franchise donors must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the other hand, the new franchise providers must conclude on the basis of the allegedly successful parent company, the challenges they have had to face and the skills that a new franchise entrepreneur needs to face in the face of similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as franchise providers may also request the assistance of the franchise advisor to create a profile based on the practice of the sector.
McLachlan also recalls that for the first time there is much help for franchise providers and entrepreneurs on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later because franchise providers will learn to assess the potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs can provide advice and help in the evaluation.
"The contribution of the first franchise partner significantly helped Brian (Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK? company founder and CEO) to create this company and franchise system," says Erik Church, the operational director of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Church has 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a Toronto franchise partner for You Move Me.
The method of finding a real franchise partner for Chruch is simple.
"Although we use the test of confidence to ask ourselves, would I call this person to the weekend barbecue?", he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'no', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day looking with them for solutions to major business challenges."
In addition, Church notes that the O2E Brands company owes a great deal of thanks to its franchise structure for its success.
In the business organisation, managers often see their position as a short-term and lower management level as a very official, while franchise entrepreneurs enter into a partnership relationship with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"The Francoise partnership has much more good sides than the traditional business structure, but it is also much more intensive," he says.
It is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such partnership is more difficult, but well managed it produces better results.
Rail delays lower grain prices in the North of the United States
Delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in the prices of cereals in the north of the United States, weeks before the huge harvest is expected to be under the new pressure of the transport network.
Commercial cereals in the North Dakota state offer farmers only $2.7 per bushel - about $ less than control prices - for the cost of securing the capacity of the trains to be transported, as traders and agricultural organisations say.
IN raw materials
The most acute problems are the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific railway company.
The Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains have to use railways in the transport of agricultural products because they are far from river networks.
The delay in rail transport increased as the heavy harvest in 2013 followed a very cold winter, which caused the slowdown and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that increased crude oil transport from North Dakotan Bakken oil milling systems has excluded the transport of cereals, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to a director of an international cereals trade company, the costs of ensuring the use of the train by storage and transferring of cereals have risen from zero to up to $2 000 per car per year.
Somebody has to pay the costs.
"These costs will be borne either by the farmer or by the customer," says the Director of the grain business.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota soya saddle will grow by more than one third and 16 per cent for spring crops.
Randy Gordon, President of the National Grain and Feed Association (National Grain and Feed Association), says that "normally we are trying to start a new harvest from a clean table, i.e., enough storage space has been emptyed for the harvest and cereals have been sold and transferred.
However, we are now beginning late due to last year's service problems.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle this year's harvest transport smoothly.
The BNSF Vice-President, John Miller, responsible for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the amount of long-lasted transport (trailers ordered by customers, which have passed more than four days) from the beginning of April, 16 500 to about two thousand.
"We have moved almost everything from the old harvest that we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the last harvest of surplus cereals.
However, the latest rates reported for the BNSF grain trains were 9% lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Mr Miller admits that development is "inequal" but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the capacity of all types of transportable products, such as the handling of grain crumbs.
Due to the second sum, the train speeds of the Canadian Pacific railway company affected by the problem are 11 per cent lower than at the same time last year, but clearly higher than those of the early year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company (Surface Transportation Board) has said that the changes to its car ordering system should improve its ability to deal with traffic by 15-20% in the future harvest period.
"The action plan for the Canadian Pacific railway company in autumn will focus on continuous improvements in train speed and efficient use of trains, so that we can deliver more and more train wagons every week," said the railway company's representative.
Ukraine's crisis could solve NATO's "identity crisis"
The leaders, diplomats and experts in the major countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO's Afghanistan mission also means the end of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident at the NATO Summit this week in Wales in Cardiff, with 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of the world's crisis on the agenda of politicians and diplomats, even to the extent that the withdrawal of the Afghan forces, which had previously been a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
On the other hand, the 28 state alliances are needed after the re-invasion of Russia into Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that threatening Europe's independence is not necessarily just a part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also transfer troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and reengagement in defence cooperation.
In some sense NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was looking for its purpose in some way -- and it was currently under way with a rather significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, Head of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, it has also become stronger.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to bring world leaders into a common strategy to defeat the militants of the Islamic State who are rapidly popular in Iraq and Syria.
According to the official opinion, the President will face significant challenges in trying to encourage his tired partners in the war to respond to the military response, in particular to those who would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama has pressures to show that he leads the world to find a strategy that will win extremist Muslims, first of all straightforwardly saying that "we have no strategy".
Western experts have set careful expectations for the summit as to whether Ukraine or the Islamic State are being reached during the discussion of breakthroughs.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main sanction for the event called the attack by Ukraine on Russia.
Officials of the European Union discussed the matter this weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries of which Obama hopes to be the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily NATO members.
Two years ago, when the previous NATO Summit was held in Chicago, the debate was governed by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, Robert M. Gates used his last speech in his position to say that the organisation has almost reached the "common military insignificance" point.
United States officials continually complained that other countries were unable to reach their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this objective last year.
Now, however, officials of the White House say they noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff, in which they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire for potential threats in the future of the Member States in their actual size.
Following Russia's entry into Ukraine, "the promises of defence are more significant and important than once after the end of the cold war," says Charles Kupfa, President of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hoped that we will reach agreement between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of its journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation for the concerned neighbours of Russia.
The President will start his trip of three days with a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he meets both the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its forces in Estonia since Russia joined the Ukrainian Peninsula this year, and NATO forces will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new preparedness plan, which will be published this week, is introduced.
The plan is aimed at shortening the time needed by NATO to respond to attacks in border countries, officials say.
The plan includes an increase in air control and other visible defence cooperation marks.
There is a small risk for NATO, who refrained from establishing permanent bases as a sign of the kindness of Eastern and Central Europe to Russia.
According to officials, the new plan does not actually violate the agreement, but it can also be a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to be named public in the course of the debates before official information.
The presence of NATO is likely to be described as long-lasting, not permanent, said the diplomat.
Putin's effective "talviase" is he using it in Ukraine?
The Russian president Vladimir Putin has one of his sleeves in relation to Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of armsing the rebels in Eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukraine.
That is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
When the situation in Ukraine has been pressed, the Western countries are planning harder sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a map: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the U.S. authorities, the primary sources of energy in Ukraine are natural gas (40 per cent) and carbon (28 per cent), Geysar Gurbanov, which is active at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When winter arrives in Ukraine within less than four months and the coal mines are located in the eastern part of the conflict of the country, the Ukrainians will freeze into their homes when the supply of gas from Russia stops.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin win the war in the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July because of unpaid bills.
Previously this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine’s depreciation of gas was already $ 5.3 billion (approximately €4 billion) by August 1.
According to the New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one thinks about it (winter) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to facilitate the resolution of the matter.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
The necessary corrections must be made and prepared for a cold period in order to re-exhaust stocks.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat before the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company from Nomuraa, pointed out last month that Russia's talks about intervention in humanitarian matters and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened within a few months if Russia can maintain the separatist's activities until then.
Moscow has already become a declaration that Ukraine must pay in advance for future gas supplies unless the Kiev sector pays the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement which would allow for the continuation of the gas imports on a provisional basis.
Last week, the Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenjuk said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy, Alexander Novak, said that the speeches were inconsistent.
He said that Russia would do all it can to deliver gas to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger got 10 years in prison and a thousand rabbies
The Saudi Arabian Court has held a ten-year imprisonment sentence for Raif Badaw, founded by the Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The sentence, as an additional penalty, includes thousands of rapaces and fines of a million rituals (approximately EUR 200 000).
The judgement was justified by the fact that he had established an Islamic degrading website.
On Monday, the AFP told the other founder of the organisation Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi itself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced in July 2013 to seven years of imprisonment and 600 years of imprisonment, but the judgment was complained and re-dismissed.
The judgment was also complained in May, when it also noted the injustice of Amnesty International.
Madventures' Riku Rantala's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the changing human encounters"
Madventures today published a new book World Exploration - Adventure Explanation for everything.
We asked Riku Rantala about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Rikus also tells us about the most important human encounter in his life.
The writer, the editor, the other party of Madventures, Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday was a filmapiknik at the Citizenstore and Wednesday begins the second production season of the Yle Docventures.
Since the morning, he's been running from place to place.
From the morning TV of the farmer to take the child to the day care and from there to the weekly breakfast.
The most facially agreed interview must be transferred to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, we can't.
In the middle of all the hurry he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write the World Exploration Book, which is the book's book of the adventurer's handbook for everything.
Everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book examines several themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than the other, why we are here and who we are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
There are both professors and artists in the book.
Actively we worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS on your phone.
You've got a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the key message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and great questions is worth thinking, because then we can do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book’s idea is to be a good travel reading, but its purpose is also to make people at home discuss and share ideas.
The debate can even lead to action, Riku says.
Photo: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
How does it look?
We concluded that the human species is optimistic.
Despite the warming up of the climate and the current state of the earth, we must believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The world is some sort of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, only then can happen a change, Riku philosophy.
Riku reports that some studies show that Western humanity has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
It can therefore be concluded that when there is enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't add happiness.
That is why we want to raise people to discuss what is enough.
The use of our natural resources will not be enough for a long time, says Riku.
You also thought about the differences in culture in your book.
How does the Indian person differ from the Finnish?
People aren't much different from each other.
Of course, the starting points for education, health and hygiene are different.
The greatest cultural difference is that the Community's importance in India is much greater in both good and bad.
When the Western countries are prosperous, people live more alone.
Isolate others and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we found an appropriate balance between communality and isolation, we would be pretty close to happiness, says Riku.
Riku has been confronted with a lot of different people in the world.
What is the best way to find a person in his mind?
It's my childhood, when I was with my family on my first bigger trip abroad.
We lived a year in India and Pakistan when my father was there in the United Nations.
I was 7 years old, and my two smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku's bottom.
Home to Finland came with a big moving car.
We drove a war in Afghanistan when there was a huge number of refugees on the road.
On the road, the girl of my age walked on her little brother's arms.
I sat on the bench of a big merch with a coke stick in my hand.
Our eyes were confronted, Riku describes.
You know, a child of your age will understand the situation.
It was one of the changing human encounters that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunne in 2013 at book fairs.
Then Rikus "go into the choir" that other people must be respected, even though they would be much poorer or they would not have the same conditions of life as we.
At that time, the Rikki realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of an adult to the surface, people encountered in New Guinea.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditional people live there.
They use natural materials for the benefit of everything, not just use money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think about it.
And to think about it, he wants Tuna and his new book to be readers.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch and listen more.
That it makes people work from a warm love to a conversation or even to a fist fight, Riku throws.
It's about the Kauhajoki magazine.
The events moved from when the couple arrived by bus to the station and they ordered a taxi.
When the taxi moved, the man on the yard threw a piece of something after the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, as was the passenger.
The man who threw the object stuck a man’s passenger in the head and in the hand and left the place.
The drummer is 170-175 centimetres, a short-haired man.
According to the magazine, there has been a young, light pony woman near the site.
They're hoping he's contacting the police.
The police also ask for advice from all those who may have made observations of events or persons related to the case.
The bombing took place on Wednesday, August 27, at 19.50 hours.
"I!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first telepathic message passed through the net
The scientific publication PLoS ONE has published an article that the International Research Group has succeeded in conveying the message directly in mind.
The first messages sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. in Spanish and Italian "moi".
In the experimental arrangement, the electric brain curve of the transmitter was monitored.
The sender was trained by the program to send bitters either by a hand or a foot movement.
The imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands to one.
This information encoded as bits was sent through the web to the receiver.
The respondent was observed by magnetic stimulation from the light lighting per one-coded bit.
The recipient had been taught to interpret the gaps as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still a field of research in their children's shoes, but they believe that computer-assisted telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Sanctions - Point - Rural Future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also extorting its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible that the EU and the United States would not react when Russia wards in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international policy action follows reaction, action responses.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be depleted in the long term.
Iran was only able to bend negotiations on its nuclear programme after years.
The South African Racial Orgues Government sat in its seat for decades, although trade was banned by UN decisions.
Sanctions have also been applied against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export state-of-the-art electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has set barriers to trade on the world side.
The last missing ones were freezing the raw wood trade.
It is clear that sanctions do not bring Russia on the knees.
The Russians have been accustomed to in bad times, and the disappearance of Viola from the trade will not cause panic.
When the EU intends to ban imports of vodka from Russia, it is essentially a joke.
The Russians prefer to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export air carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not to stop imports of cheese or vodka exports.
The biggest disadvantages are the limitations of the financial sector.
They will only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on an international loan market.
It needs to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Even though Russia has huge reserves, they will not last forever.
Russian companies get credit and money gets more expensive.
Your own banks are not able to finance everyone.
We need to put more weight on the money, or we're going to have to get companies in trouble with payment.
Bankruptcies are bankrupt in Russia too, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia’s modernization will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsinki’s Sanom.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Slowly Russia would return again to Russia and walk inward.
An exceptional free pressure event in North Korea was organised
Approximately 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international free printing in Pjongjang on Saturday.
The event organized by the Japanese Antonio Inoki from a lawyer to a free printer took part of the pressors from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free printing, taekwondo matches were also seen by local athletes.
According to Inok, the aim of the event was to bring together conflicting states through sport and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, the politicians hoped to improve between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of the japanese abductions in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, for its part, promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
The last international free pressure in North Korea was seen in 1995.
SOK reduces around 110 people from the organisation of the goods trade.
The Yt negotiations began in June, with a reduction of not more than 130.
According to the company, overlapping activities have now been dismantled from its organisation and the responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK states that it is seeking a clear better cost-effectiveness and synergy between different sectors.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, the restructuring of trade has shaken, in particular, the trade in goods of use.
The result of S-group goods trade has been lost for some time.
The Yt-Negotiations concerned all SOK's employees and managers, i.e. approximately 530 people.
Turun Says: Some of the self-treatment medicines behind the dish
According to the magazine, more medicines are being given without a prescription, but only after advice from the pharmacist.
According to the Finnish Pharmaceutical Union, for example, eye drops containing antibiotics could come into the scope of counselling.
After an interview with a pharmaceutical or commissioner and when the predefined criteria are met, the medicine should be given behind the stove, according to Kirsi Kvarnström, President of the Pharmacy Association in Turun Sanom.
There are already a few medicines available without a prescription in Finland, but there is a need for advice.
One of these is a contraception.
Corruption for more detailed reasons
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended both by the OECD and by the Council of Europe, as the world is astonished by the smallness of donations and sentences in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice's working group will consider whether the provisions of the Criminal Law on trade and abuse of influence would be necessary.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the case of Patria's donation in the Slovenian court in Hämeenlinnan a year ago.
Trading power in Slovenia brought to the former Prime Minister of the two-year sentence, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal name.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has intensified its cooperation as required by the government programme.
According to the recently completed survey, corruption is hardly being investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and from the University of Police and the University of Occupational Sciences on corruption in various areas.
Messi potee rib injury - Sports - Karjalainen
Captain Lionel Messi of the Argentinian Football Country Team will leave Wednesday's race against Germany.
The Messiah keeps on the side of the view, told him about his company in Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona keeps Messi on the side as a precaution.
The Messi insulted the leg on Sunday's league fight against Villareal.
Barcelona won the 1-0 game.
The Messiah also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he will be getting racers for the Asian Champions League fight in Korea
Tony Popovic's missing three key players in Korea.
Many of the players in the Western Sydney Wanderers team are on a game ban in the first match, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asian Champions League witchboard in the FC Seoul game.
The Wanderers are at a 10-day training camp in Dubai, including two friendship matches in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match on 17 September.
Due to the excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole miss the Korean journey, but coach Popovic believes in their successors.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players in the ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
It's a retreat, none of the players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Anyone who comes to the place, he must have done a lot of work, and I fully trust the entire team.
I'm not afraid to play against anyone in the semifinals.
The Wanderers also have to be without Spiranovic, which continues to recover from the ankle surgery.
The Socceroos team defender was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in the return game at the Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
"He's back on his career and he's going to recover well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's been exercising a couple of times outside, which's good.
It'll take a while before she's all right, but she'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world's top-level facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic believes that the trip to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get better acquainted with each other after the major changes in last season.
"We know that this will certainly help players create links," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get even better acquainted both on the ground and outside.
So we use camps for many purposes.
Elite's hamburger pays three times the monthly salary of a worker
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to be part of the country's elite.
The Financial Times tells me about the counterfeiting of the economy.
In North Korea, the informal market may grow more than ever.
They offer wealthy or saving ordinary citizens luxury that has not been used to connecting to the dictatorship state.
Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: the entertainment centre, where only a ticket pays up to ten months of normal worker's salary.
You'll get some hamburgers who pay $76.
It's a salary of 3-5 months for the country's normal dunes.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's "westerly market" began in the 1990s, when the country suffered famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies can in the worst way be rough.
Still, in the capital of Pjongjang, many have a mobile phone with a door of $200.
The part of the cause may be in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create himself with energy and a young image.
During his time, the government has emphasised the importance of technology in the flourishing of the earth.

Ormiston House: Stormont’s Council of hopes on sales
The Stormont Council hopes that it has found a buyer at Ormiston House, a building in Belfast, which paid the taxpayers almost 3,000 pounds a week.
The Council bought a building from the 1800s in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid nine million pounds.
The Council was unable to continue selling the building, when the security and maintenance of the building came to pay the Council about GBP 400 a day.
The building was sold recently for $1.25 million.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
In 2001, the Council purchased a building classified in class B of historical value for GBP 9 million, as it needed additional office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was resaled at the price of GBP 2.5 million this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist Party, suggested that Ormiston House might be a new international trauma centre.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will conduct negotiations on the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as long as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate broker remain silent about the buyer's identity and sales price.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are approximately 3,000 pounds.
The Council purchased the building from the police forces preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
The security costs of Ormiston House by the beginning of this year amounted to a total of GBP 885 641 and maintenance costs to GBP 371 379.
The price of professional repair and maintenance services was GBP 250 015 and the fees for development and design professionals were GBP 212.466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was bought by Harland's business partner William Pirrie. Pirries later became president of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after Lord Pirrien's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. It was sold in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-1970s.
"Early Growing": Helsinki intends to reduce school assistants
There's no savings, says JHL.
Helsingfors is preparing for a radical reduction in the number of school assistants per school.
The reduction would not affect the child's personal assistant.
The Helsinki Education Board ended in the spring to present a total of about 2.7 million out of the resources of school assistants.
There are about 600 school attendance assistants in Helsinki.
If the reductions occur, they enter into force in the course of the semester immediately at the beginning of the year.
According to the JHL, the decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, for reasons of savings, it is unfortunate to reduce assistants, as the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings will certainly not be generated, on the contrary, the labour burden of teaching staff will increase.
In schools, savings pose a greater risk of falling from the learning objectives, and it is also hard to handle teachers, stresses the JHL's CEO, Dagen Niemi-Laine.
The city plans in Helsinki are inequality between schools, because small schools and students in need of support will no longer have access to aid resources at all.
The goal of Helsinki city is to prevent exclusion.
Preventive work is carried out by school assistants.
However, the adaptation measures of the Education Agency have been directed for the most part to this group.
This will continue to affect all parties.
The final solution to the resources will be made by the City Council of Helsinki in the autumn, to which I hope the vision and wisdom will look far in the future and act in line with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel Powers Land on the West Bank
Israeli women walk in the Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the Etzion area near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel took over nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank in the Jewish settlement area near Bethlehem, a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, while at the same time defying the Palestinians’ request not to build more dwellings and defying the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which is opposed to the expansion of the West Bank's settlements, felt that Sunday's events could be the largest individual land in the West Bank's region for decades and could 'dramatically change the situation in the region'.
The Palestinians' objective is to establish their own country for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political impetus to assess the situation in the lands came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after they had lifted them in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the main perpetrator of kidnapping and killing.
The timing of taking over the territory suggests that it was intended to be a kind of compensation for the population of housing and a punishment for the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish Gevaot Assignment, the territory of the southern Jerusalem Etzion area has now been officially declared a "state land" when it was previously in the Palestinian private property. This was a necessary step to enable Israel to start planning buildings for the area when it wanted to.
However, Mayor Ahmad Lafi of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news office WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff issued early Sundays orders in which Israel announced to take over the countries of Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin, containing olive trees and other trees.
Any objections should be made within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army to carry out discipline on the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamic Group in Gaza, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
As a result, the tensions at the border between Israel and Gaza marked a 50-day war that ended last week in Egypt's ceasefire.
The take-over of the territory has promptly drawn attention to the West Bank of Israel and revealed the contradictory objectives of the Israeli Government, which hamper the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
Lapland crises are usually multi-pronged
An increasing proportion of the municipalities in Lapland are facing problems, is reflected in the well-being study prepared by the University of Lapland and the University of Lapland.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, it is not enough to reduce the role of municipalities by a billion euros.
The common characteristics of crisis communities include poor municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Asko Suikkase, Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis communities are coming from the western border and East Lapin.
In the survey, the population assesses the situation in their municipality very realistically.
In the study, the inhabitants of well - managed municipalities even took a pessimistic view of the prospects.
High expectations affect consumption.
People hope that today’s ark and well - being will be preserved, perhaps even little healing.
In this time, we are not dare to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The research team surprised the large differences between the municipalities.
For example, expenditure on livelihood support per capita varies from a couple of ten to a large amount of over EUR 100.
The municipal tax revenue per capita varies from EUR 2 000 to EUR 4400 from Ranua's fairness.
The towns of Lapland are different.
How money is used, how much government shares are obtained, and what is the level of debt, is very different even in similar situations in municipalities, he says.

Great Britain may close borders from returning Islamist fighters
The UK may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters to Iraq and Syria.
The BBC tells us about this, referring to government sources.
However, according to BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism could retain their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is being finalised and Prime Minister Cameron is expected to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way could be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they could temporarily confiscate passports for potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, the UK raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes the immediate release of Melinda Taylor from Libyan prison by Australian lawyer
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from Libyan prison today.
The Federal Government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
The representative of Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "all goes well" and that the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released from the Australian authorities this evening, and then he will get into a plane flying into Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased with the news that he is likely to be released today," the representative commented on the issue to the AAP news office from New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for the assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before continuing his journey to Haag.
Taylor and three of his lawyers were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintan on 7 June when they represented Seif al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddaf, former Libyan dictator.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor brought documents to Seif that they thought threatened national security.
Senator Carr has seen a lot of effort to release Taylor, including traveling to Libya's capital in Tripoli last month to drive this matter.
Taylor couldn't have talked to her husband or her little daughter until last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to call a short call home to the Hague soon after the visit to the Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke to the parents of Taylor in Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had appealed to Libya to release her daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other arrested criminal court lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that, following a discussion between a lawyer released in the Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the lawyer of the Criminal Court was sorry and asked for any misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of any mistakes, but has promised to investigate the actions of its team thoroughly after its members have returned home.
"As a result of its investigation by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all who have done wrong will be judged in due course," the Court announced last month in its communication.
The International Criminal Court calls for proceedings against the 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during the administration of his father, which suddenly ended last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and took an initiative on 1 May, stating that he did not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to be held in the Hague.
The young entrant saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took his second victory in the early stages of the Spanish Football League, but it was easy not Villarreal crashed at home.
The Blue Blues swept their heads in the Villarreal guard Sergio Asenjo until the 82th minute finally succeeded.
The winner was a surprising man: 19 years old, the attacker Sandro Ramirez made his first appearance in La Liga had come to the field only 12 minutes earlier.
A young man from Barcelona's 2nd team, who had been invited to attend, finished close after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Mess's company.
The gatherings to Ferguson police ended mysteriously after $433,000 exceeded.
The guards closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after collecting more than $400,000 from the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old Ferguson, Missouri State.
On the GoFundMe website open to the general public, two separate pages bearing similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have collected $235, 750 and $197,620 for the Ferguson police who shot Michael Brown.
Brown's family lawyer's similar website had collected $314,099 after Sunday afternoon.
As a result of the shooting, many weeks of agitation and the demonstration, mostly against the almost white police forces of the black population of Ferguson, forced Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations attempted to decide whether he was shooting Brown for no reason.
Network collection campaigns have brought about some progress in defending Wilson, especially after some of the visitors on the page had written racist comments in the commentary section, which have since been deleted.
Both pages apparently ceased to receive donations at most at the same time on Saturday, and the keepers of the pages did not give reasons for this.
On the page, when a visitor attempts to give a donation, he sees a message saying: "The donations are no longer received!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe website issued a press release to the Los Angeles Times that it did not prevent donations from being given.
"Every GoFundMe campaign organizer decides himself when he wants to stop receiving donations," Kelsea Little said on the GoFundMe website.
Organisers may also continue to receive donations later if they wish.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $197,620, is maintained by the Shield of Hope, a charitable team of St. Louis police, who is the recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe site.
On Sunday, the three police officers, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, registered as official representatives of the Shield of Hope, did not respond to e-mails requesting further information on the collection campaign.
Customs is the official reporter of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the nearby Florence City Council and Roorda Missour's Chamber of Representatives.
The Times also did not immediately contact the founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750. He has not been confirmed as a recipient of donations accepted by the website.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe website, in its press release to The Times, assured that there was an unnamed goodmaker.
The anonymous goodmaker of the collection campaign has been given little information to donors, unlike the maintainers of the other Wilson page or Brown donation site.
The nameless Wilson page goodmaker wrote a message to visitors two weeks ago that the page would cooperate with the Shield of Hope group to become officially accepted recipient of donations.
No approval has yet been granted.
The goodmaker provided additional information to the visitors wishing to receive the password with the Gmail e-mail address, but did not respond to the request immediately on Sunday.
The GoFundMe's representative said in the press release to The Times that the anonymous collection page was removed from the search results of the main site and added that "the questionful campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe's GoFundMe's notification that it should be used to have an effective Facebook account".
In terms of data security practices on the GoFundMe website, users are urged to "donate only to GoFundMe users whom they know personally and whom they trust".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is correct and honest.
According to the representative Little, however, GoFundWe have been "in touch with the organizer of the campaign and have no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to retain all the funds collected if it is necessary to start studies in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe did not consider it appropriate to hold the funds collected by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised Wilson-supporting campaigns, told the followers of the page this weekend that lawyers are trying to find "explanation", why donators on the GoFundMe site have been prevented from giving donations, but the page did not provide further information.
Also on the Facebook page has an anonymous maintainer and an independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal's top attacker on the end of the year's page - Valioliiga - Night Messages
The English Valioliiga Arsenal French attacker Olivier Giroud is likely to be on the side until year round.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday and healing takes months.
Giroud hurt his legs this weekend at the Valioliga fight against Everton.
The surgery went well, but she's on the side until she can play at the top level, the end of December or the beginning of January, Arsenal's main coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports.
Last season, Giroud was Arsenal's best goalmaker with 16 hits, so the loss is noticeable.
Wenger said, however, that he did not necessarily get Giroud any more space during this transfer window.
Wenger played the fresh acquisition of Alexis Sanchez at the top on Wednesday at the Master League's Karsintafinal against Besiktasia.
Arsenal won the 1-0 Sanchez goal.

Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's most famous criminal writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt's popular Bridge series, are preparing a new TV series together.
The tenth series of Advocates is scheduled to start next year.
