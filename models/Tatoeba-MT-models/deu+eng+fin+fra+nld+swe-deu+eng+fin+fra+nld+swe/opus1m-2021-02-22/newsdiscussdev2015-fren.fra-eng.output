Looks like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's common in the rugby is big anything...
Yes, at last, you don't interrupt Muslim prayers and you don't break anyone's nose during the drinking games (finally, unless it's part of the game), but you actually painted yourself black for some dressed evenings.
I've never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme that says.
Yeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the first year's student prospectus seemed quite typical.
In other words, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go far further than the misogyne jokes and jokes under the takeover of alcohol that is often associated with academic rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to cause as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your damages and stereotypes obstruct the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is populated by former students from these schools for whom the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old private boys.
Issus from very different backgrounds from those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So are the "Magogyne jokes" acceptable?
Looks like the rugby club at my university, I've never seen racist behavior, but the naked races through campus, theft, property damage and misogy were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't specify it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: say that your own body itself is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm gonna win in restlessness.
ancestral therefore also this interstellar cloud (or not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of your pastis's water has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yeah, well, we can still consider that the pastis fleet has an average of over 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad already that
A lot of nose to catastrophic and warming of any hair that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
An irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon troppo: What is the evidence that the warming has stopped?
I don't see the link.
I believe Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, what do you have for second degree and irony as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a matter for the "castrophists" as you say to worry about the disparity of the oceans, but rather about the reduction of human consumption water reserves (you know the fresh water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not the climate warming that is most threatening for our species, but above all the reduction of low or not-necessary resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that bear our ever-increasing lifestyles.
As for the study you quote and the generous effort you make to quote the source, we are somewhat naturally doubting the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to the problems of fresh water, I assure you French are far from being concerned xD Then you have to stop considering ecology as a problemless dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimation 100% for 2050 at the current pace).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, no thanks.
"Then you have to stop treating ecology as an unfailing dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly."Yes, finally, it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our earth will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that, through the action of oxygen, will capture heat without liberating it and which in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the least sign that 10,000 good men would have come to the ground to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could it be?
I don't think so!
In the small brain of Abbott, maybe sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're going backwards, it's certain.
When are they gonna get rid of that idiot from the village?
The latest disclosures that vegetation would consume 16 per cent more CO2 than any permitted climate model give priority to replanting.
This is logical not, because CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora throughout the world.
Looks like this scientific fact has never been put on the ground.
Did you see the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels are increasing from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument about plant food is only a fallful distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials may be carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is faint and deserves to be ridiculized.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was the most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most advertising to bring the Liberals back to marginal voters.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, bravo champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants make less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people need to eat them in much greater quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
It is obvious that this Member is a child.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from deviating from the rules of the XVIIst.
However, sanctioning him and not Thevenoud, it is incomprehensible for many people, even though the AN regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady does a whole business is not to her honour, it seems especially hysteria.
If Mitterrand had imposed a fine on all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that in the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academy" had been infused: "Let's say Ms. the guardian or the guardian of the Shells" (post that had never been occupied by a woman until then).
Pure machism!
"The political arena" ....!
The sandy bay, the backyard of the Republic replenishes, the pussy of the operets, the tabling of illusions, etc. ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, please, badly.
Qd the Umpiste phalocrate sits on the label and the parliamentary regulation by making the elementary civility twisted under the false umbrella of good ways, the sanction applies to him "the quality" for his partisan headhead and his misuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He does provocation to make him talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he may be un proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The academy on the right back and we see that the Members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP must strive to solve its internal problems and stop causing cramps and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you make her tell what she doesn't say.
This Member is acting as a college in the middle of a teenage crisis, which makes provocation and whose friends, in delegation, are going to see the Chief to cancel the leading hours.
and defending him on the basis of a text that they haven't even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of the UMP team.
Mr. Judge, I appeal to two experts who have a few thousand years of separation.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, grabs, horses, they all do stupid things for the mere pleasure that it gives them.
On the contrary, it would seem that the majority of our 80-year-olds are passionate to work, move and do shops.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply our lifetime by two, but we pass the majority of it in boring.
How did we get this?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, maybe?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go search, etc.
This is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that we hear a lot of bullshit about animals who are "playing" while they're just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "usable" (it can be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that " there is a principle of playing on the basis of any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have violated her" Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for the hope to give you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to answer an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and would even tend to be rather enthusiastic by those who seem crazy first.
But when one sees what many have learned from their education at school, especially among the most likely public to engage in aggressions against women, my enthusiasm does not find the very beginning of an anchoring point.
"the most likely public to commit aggressions on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's fine, we understood.
And yes, reality doesn't always smell the rose, even if it doesn't necessarily correspond to your thought patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's disargented youth, too!
If the reacs were no longer responding, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko as the first choice.
I didn't learn anything of this at school and I never raped anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Should I feel lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
Family microsociety is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you don't know how to read?
And are young socialists going to suburban schools to teach equality between men and women?
It would be more effective than making moralizing assemblies on Twitter, but we should get out of beautiful neighborhoods...
It's a big campaign.
They're naughty everywhere, but to give moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article doesn't go anywhere.
It's not time to joke about the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a double-linked word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
Sixty pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in retirement.
How does it happen that the more we pay, the less there is in the basement?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by the weight or number of calories, just as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a monk?
That makes no sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more food.
Of course, this should not be the case.
Sportsman at Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini meals.
The more expensive you pay, the more chances you have to receive a child portion prepared with art in your base.
At least, they made efforts to put on boards.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you think I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (Amazing) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good food?
Is Manif for all only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's a kind of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern "child manufacturing" systems.
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by a technology device.
Battery breeding?
Where do you get that from?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in "manufacturing", you must claim the ban on LDCs for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am also surprised that the so-called "for all" manif has not yet this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that it is not the only Catholics who manifest: the other religions too, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is useful to remember that these various churches have been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup rebelled violently against the GVT's willingness to admit girls to school in the name of "the defence of the family".
We're still in the same pattern.
And, more recently, the same currents cried at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be given to these people's positions.
No need to be catho to be inclined to market the stomachs and children...
All this is in the right line of the decade of Western civilization, increasingly contested by others!
For me, freedom ends with others: yes with the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other as well as others.
But it is not a question of tolerating that the child is a furniture object.
And this is also true for the heteros looking for GPA.
I just can't love this guy, or recognize his results.
If he had a better control of the ball and knew to avoid moments of foolishness, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure any other attacker, except Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have marked if he had been given more than 42 selections as a national team...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article speaks of the goals it has marked, I'm not going to talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa did not bring or bring anything), but maybe it would be another reason why he won much more often than, let us say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07, 2014 12h48 Recommended 119 It's in the way to criticize Rooney at the moment so we can forgive you to do so as well.
In other words, it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive passes in 93 games.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive passes in 96 games.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its statistics on the ground are excellent.
By the way, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridiculize it.
I am forced to wonder if you really look at the foot or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would mark as many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticisms about Rooney's capabilities as a footballer come from.
The most difficult is to be selected regularly in the country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's footballer (not even an attacker) qualities with Peter Crouch's?
Do you do this without joking?
There are really people completely in the mass.
Please note also for your government that Rooney has not always been the front center of England's goal machine during his career as a team in England.
Instead, he played the backed front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players like Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch, which was mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that by joking.
In a country where the weapon port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people have a weapon, I find it completely schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way of doing.
Well, the ones in this school are just not at all in agreement with the license of arms port in the United States!
use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the crap, the girl's 5 years old.
How many kids play with factice guns at this age at our home?
Is that actually the murderers in power?
Although the port of arms is in the U.S. constitution and it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that the African children are significantly different from ours.
A bit of good sense and reason kept svp.
It's a disarming process!
Let's see that you've been trapped!
The information on this fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually owns, or does not at all, premices in the taste of the morbidity.
Could we leave the principle that a serial killer can't already have a strange behavior at the age of 5?
If people need a psych follow-up, it's more the bullshits of this school than the students!
Let the parents take their child out of there: she's in danger!
Full agreement.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely sick.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most reprehensible state in the United States but it is part of it.
What a goddamn country!
Her relative youth?
These reluctant blue suits that men wear have nothing of a entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather jacket and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled collar sweater.
I can't comment too much because I never looked at this, but everything sounds so boring and without soul.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Contrary, maybe?
But what does that look depressing!
You've been ahead of me.
I would have thought a thin knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr Bjayou is doing these days.
Perhaps by saying "ostracize", he meant "exile".
That would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he could have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
Worstly, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a grey suit, we could move forward that their intention was to ostracize it.
But here, no.
Looks like it has been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole phrase has been invented!
It's not weird.
haha, who knows what he could say?
Surely nothing, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "ostracize", which absolutely didn't mean anything.
The chomage rate in the United States has still declined by around 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices fall in all States.
The American economy, with Obama, is constantly strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "sustainable"?
To live there right now, I say that the United States is gradually getting closer to the explosion as the inequalities become crazy there.
The political system is literally ruined by the state of funding electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have a scale that is not imagined in Europe, but Americans maintain an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial media said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forget the essence.
The level of consumption in the US economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and banknote boards will not be able to give the change for a long time...
On the ground of exhaustion of land resources and growing needs of the rest of the world.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "drink" or rather scratch.
I can't blame him for that Farage.
Will Labour finally understand that his cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate foreign voters makes him lose even more support at home?
Probably not.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to enjoy our American masters and their ongoing cold war with Russia.
Labour's shameful performance, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, it plays with 617 votes.
Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's mass immigration policy was designed "to put the right nose into diversity"
Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in safe seat against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to this return of manifold, the pendulum has flown very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will go back in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Safety Headquarters of Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who is not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories saw much worse, but for Labour it's a victory at the Pyrrhus.
Search the word "winner" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "deceased", it wins the battle!
I agree with Jack, it's a victory, but it's thin.
Labour should have earned at least a few thousand votes.
If they record such a performance in a secure seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I'm no matter who wins in 2015 until the Lib Dems are not here.
Of course, you don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice creams from Canada, Greenland and northern Russia.
On the other hand, I wonder whether the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered too?
In general, we need to see the Earth more "pigly" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
Some little confusions.
On the other hand, Wylie talks about a "simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice weighing on the earth's road, the pressure on the coat is leaking, which would give/given a) a blow to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the "shoot" or the facilitation of surface access will be (more or less) located.
Difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa With regard to climate warming, I think it is careful to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendlyly, patricedud, does this volcanicism have an impact on our environment?
Does it affect our future or past climate warming?
Is Prudence not to stop warming?
When the complexity is unresolved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe it.
Yeah, but also, when it's night, we see less well.
Hello, the end of the last glacier period has also been accompanied by a higher seismic activity, especially in the "active" mountain chain where on the very enclosed continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
CB Cordial
It is too often not known that the ground road floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, delayed, following its passage to Zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This suggests that the slipping of the tectonic plates, as well as the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bow, especially since the polar coats are reduced by the ironing of ice, which therefore causes changes in the equator's balance of land, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am enjoying this "human," saying himself the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commandor, ridiculizing himself by his stupid action on the environment that created it and which he has so separated, which has become harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature that exceeds him in the organization of his own visceres, by an invention that consists of finding all the means possible to dominate his neighbor, one another, making fun of collaboration, money.
The earth's cradle is not based on magma, but on the earth's coat, which is made of solid rock.
Personally, I find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Surely the next part.
Beautiful story of Wild1
Instead, it reminds me of a totally fantastic 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
It's a shame that you never missed the first impression.
Your loss...
"The geladas, our far-reaching ancestors" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thanks Brian
I'm almost sure that the documentary "History of humanity" has already been realized several times, they're still going to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh, there I can't stand that guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to make a cock-eye in front of a brain in a bocal.
And his narrative...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
There may be a group of support for you, that says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
It therefore requires that it be self-conformed, therefore non-conform.
Certainly, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual interrogation expresses that advent.
But at that time it is just the premisses that appear, today individualism structures the entire society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without making it an irreversible horizon, is there no relative to the Cartesian approach to consider what one receives to believe, what one believes himself.
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter - reform!
By positioning the problem at the level of his paranoid nail, he blocked all progress and reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that supports: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being anticonformist, it's fighting this disguise.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, let's ask ones...
Black and rebels, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, understand the most followed of those who see themselves rebearing in their mirror.
In any case, thank you to his controversial polemics to bring this patient and persevering humanist Marcel Gauchet, who is so educationally illuminating.
David Cameron supports the rise in the inheritance tax threshold
How many further budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase his net value once he's out of power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best-sellers written by a nigger on " serious policy" – it will be £100 once he has passed the weapon to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want any inheritance tax.
Wouldn't it be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay the least inheritance taxes thanks to super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
It'll be £100 once he has passed the weapon to the left.
Anything.
He will probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it's worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650 000 for couples?
Did you also think Brown was thinking only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him the last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only afford to accuse him of lying if he had actually been elected to power.
Like the rest of us, " Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and the imminent collapse will end him and others of his acabit.
His "richness" will be as unnecessary as that of others and will neither save him nor his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded £1,000 million.
We all have to be imposed to pay essential services and reimburse debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that discipline is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "deficits".
Unreasonable statement for the math teacher that she was!
Like what...
Better recruiting and training of teachers is part of a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class has no other approach than quantitative.
There are two possible answers, the first would be to select teachers according to their ability to communicate knowledge => reform of recruitment procedures.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Don't understand them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to creating a defiance relationship that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => one training in skills to teach.
A profession that learns, of course.
But pedagogy is primarily an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings it is not making automotive parts.
Pedagogy it doesn't equate even when you're a mathematics teacher!
The "sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing, rightly, is a real vocation at bcp of those who kiss the professors
If donations exist, pedagogy (I prefer discipline) allows those who have less ease not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real stranger today are the students whose 1/3 tell us: Learning is nothing I already know what I think.
An article by Slate describes quite well the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's restate the old Normal Schools of Instituters..
It ends at 3 a.m. from this week, but it begins at midnight.
If that's true, it's in any way suitable for his time use.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
That's not right for mine!
It's been years that his show begins at midnight.
We have this thing called iplayer and that allows us to listen to programs at demand when we want it!
The Internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlay on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have an USB type adapter on the back of my SKY box that is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated.
Yeah, I think I was wrong in the schedule, I had to hear Richard Lester at about three hours.
Although it's men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would be a pleasure for people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Her show is of any sensational disguised in debate, and she would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular promoters, Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show the evening at the return of the job, is a woman
It's five programs.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows that very well, but don't say anything - for the moment.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached ever.
Jeremy Vine may be returned to the office as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I guess he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get tired or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal that these people vote UN.
For 40 years, we have had the same parties that switched to power and made the keys of the country to the other in a less good condition than they did.
Campaigns are very poor, much poorer than suburbs with insulation.
You need to make miles to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theatre.
But since they don't burn a car, they don't attack, they don't deal, they don't care about politicians...
But for mercy, don't talk about a department where you didn't live.
Yes ,Doclocal , these are sub-men , sociology is good to look at them.
They also have the rate of absenteism and early alcoholism very high...
The UN is prospering on human foolishness, inculture and ignorance as well as saying that it still has a huge growth potential, they really need to be bad in order not to have done better...
Today, the UN is prospering mainly on poverty, the fear of everyday life, the fear of the other, and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a shameful humanity.
Fortunately there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and taught to save honor.

This is what happens.
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" in fact, there is less and less resource =>lower staffing.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean here is that in many developing countries, existing standards, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles, are questioned.
This allows for recognition that women can work in the economic sphere and that is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognition that women will then have a double plague, i.e. they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize the roles of gender.
Money talks, and if a sex isn't high, the next one!
The profits are joking about your life.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The benefits of heroism and children's education are joking.
If it was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women aged 20 to 45.
Well said my sister.
It is very problematic that no one speaks of unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) must be more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it enables our societies to operate and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" out of their homes...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to Mskayadee's point, how can we take into account women's disproportionate responsibilities in gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he will help a lot of people who need to "check a box".
Tiger isn't Russian, it's just Western propaganda.
The Chinese alone are responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger to the right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply running near the border, long-term exercises planned before the present situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-air missile in his possession.
Liberate the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yes, please.
He immediately came up with me the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext found everything to arm some separatists to annex China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, it is China is in Siberia.
It's just time to fix this anomalie.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful rock and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into a bet against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is not a leaf on the Siberian tiger, but a leaf on the suites of a Putin Com operation.
When you are exposed so much to the media, you are also exposed to irony or even to criticism.
The tribute of the perpetual victimization of the Soviet-Poutinian sympathizers.
Holland had also taken full pear with its camel without screaming with the anti-French conspiracy.
At our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg Saint Protector of the Great Russia, he was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
At least the tiger he understood everything, he left...
It's one thing that Hollande's doing basher.
At first sight, it seems to be a terriblely condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems to be both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to say again.
And if only 53% of this sample brushes the teeth before, and 73% after that, it is a little empty sense of complaining about paternalism.
After all, there is no disadvantage of brushing your teeth!
Indeed - in essence, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at unemployed people and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out to be correct, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue from the Department of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better means to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonablely thought.
There is a disadvantage of brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can pierce the teeth and cause an inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guiness record book where someone had tried to brush his teeth the longest and the judges Guiness at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the harmful effects of frequent and prolonged teeth brushing.
' at first sight ' - very funny.
Looks like a messy experimental design.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study would have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioural studies include things like double blind, witnesses, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each young person who feels social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give back information about times when they brush or don't brush their teeth (results easily thrown in the air by people who give their results according to perception expectations).
Is there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have an impact on genetic heritage, not in genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterus transplantation affect this phenomenon?
The nest itself looks like a kind of transplantation.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we don't want to be born of a impossible perfect clone of ourselves, is it a problem at first?
It seems to me that this is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for maternity and paternity must not push to go ever further, without asking itself the question of ethics, risk-taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not very powerful, it is not without limits and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they want.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tran
But let people, women and others, have their body, their notion of love that can go to risk taking and manage your little testiculars to you alone, alone in your little pants to yourself.
of their "confier" this magic bag so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him sterily in my safe if he could still give love?
The current tightened circumstances make PR FRYDMAN careful about its communication, but if "we" agreed to think, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What you're going to do as an anti-argument: see here these all male reactions curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has no anodine.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodin.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I've never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it understands both for the recipient and for the donor), it's a real operation.
Now, as a man, I would not allow to judge in one sense or another, nor to take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: in fact, it has nothing anodine, and it strengthens the act of love that it involves.
Give a kidney to a member of his family who needs it doesn't have any anodine either, and that does!
Please, no messi v Ronaldo combinations.
It's down.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially that there's no real competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Deportivo became a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Segunda but don't have the standard of the League.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all Real Madrid's goals record this season to then return to Old Trafford this summer with the quiet consciousness...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a shit connection so I can't tell you much if it's just Valencia's defending well and without counting on possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid that the field environment would be overrun too quickly, but they played well.
The game of Parejo overall becomes better.
A horrific penalty cowardly claimed but rightly saved by Diego.
A chasing Mestalla atmosphere and it didn't have to be funny for the Atletico bus to be bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the origins of the momification", well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archeologia 524 last September.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and date what you think is intuitive.
Not surprising that before making it complicated we made it simple.
Every science progresses by little steps.
And was the "organ" of the woman that was thus preserved to her?
Passionate!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me a few times ago that a black child momy had been discovered in today's Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I think that momy was earlier than 1000 years old in the first known African momies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little obsessed with reading.
These may not be contaminated in modern times.
Was the desert at that time not less far away than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis pushing where there's only sand right now?
We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scientist to say this, even without any evidence, to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything in their homes.
But the song doesn't tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it's not and is always "his badly known advancers".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal quacks of the free market and preaching against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people affected by the Ebola and on which the Spanish government lies, not to give itself a bad image and to protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they might remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same in tourism, but in particular the right governments (i.e. those of Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, do not hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Although I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good to nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that this is their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say yes, it is important.
If they were to totally return missionaries, I don't see why they could not have sent them to an air military base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalised hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is its base of power, until the courts intervened.
It's nothing but a right-wing officer in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's screwed up in the next elections.
To be right to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far from his right and would well find his place to the religious crazy of the right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had before descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I apologize, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party from right to right.
These are other cases, believe me.
The Spanish government lies about almost everything about it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without placing the work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE bosses - SMEs seem to read The World to take the time to condemn the words of Pr.
Let's go about the anti-intellectualism of the ambient era.
A professor of law at the College of France does not seem to be able to know the labour market unless he is the Nobel Economics Prize and proposes to liberalize it completely.
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villermé noticed the work of children 8 years of age 10 a.m. a day, when the Canuts were shot off because of a signed collective agreement.
Oh, good old times...
Your reaction is just as fascinating by your lack of knowledge of TPE's boss's profession!
Its profession is not to know the law in all its ways, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscripts registered on my youth pay note, more than 100 information today!
Here's an example, there's a lot more to mention, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without any measure of consequences, and which suffocates small businesses.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
To bring the neck to the archi-reset argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code compared to the helmet, a serious academic would have dived into the Swiss texts and would have compared the amount of official texts, then the amount of comments (the absence of the French Labour Code may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By commenting in a Code, whether it is work or not, the case law is addressed in particular...
And yes, in France there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when an employee is dismissed, for example....
Who's this complicated??
Do you think that the rules of law (laws, case law, conventions, contracts) are unsupportable barriers to work and trade?
What's he doing?
How long does that last?

Is this guy still in the wing?
It is probably time for new revolutionary absurdities to make criticisms...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I recently read, you are one of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Go on to something else!
Go see elsewhere, there is no lack of choice in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokespersons of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokespersons of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokespersons are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, this is what you miss.
Thank you for this, you just ruined my breakfast.
I apologize, but you had to explain it at any cost (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who's sparking out of old irreplaceable ceramics and calling it art, isn't it?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to attract attention.
The real artists make the difference.

KARSENTY DEMISSION this man is inappropriate to occupy an elective mandate the extremists from all boards (including Zionists) must be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the conspiracy, which have given him several judicial convictions, are both shamed by Israel and the mayor of Neuilly.
It does not represent either of them.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting the truth alone, marginally.
ASSEMBLE RESEMBLE
What is going to do with the Neuilly Mayor against Philipe Karsenty, who insults a journalist and his family, and who calls publicly to attack this urbanist?
Excuse me for crime?
Can't I find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This type needs care, in the same way as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/Anti-Israel conspiracy and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious distractors.
As many people believe to see in any political decision the hand of the "sionists" (the term of which the sense tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, like the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile the belly of the beast my good lady one would seem to be returning to Russia of the 19th century!"
To note that Karsenty's incredible stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's reportage are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the conspiracy on September 11 are foolish.
And this type has political responsibilities, it is extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy to the theory of the conspiracy of September 11, we are talking about cognitive dissonance about how to address the subject.
Totally blinded by a completely twisted truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is intolerant for this theory to get rid of it (as in the case of extreme religious).
Following a logical and inevitable leak forward, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a complete, but does not pretend to interfere with the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful and not put everyone in the same basket, but that is what you do for September 11.
There are still a fluff of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudien/consortia do not seem to be pressing to answer it.
There are indeed very fierce theories, but the official theories are also, at least on a few points.
Oh no more is funny now...
Health NGOs and public health speakers believe that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, the alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is rising," but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think that's an attack... go get a drink and relax?
Better risk this than put my mental health at risk by abstaining from me.
The Government ends the pleasures when it costs it money.
Here are other alarmistic advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average glasses a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second means that it is a amount more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should work together (about one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure that they agree - whether justified or not.
Now we're going to tax them completely, like smokers!
They already do it - soon it will be grass!
My father didn't drink, and he didn't smoke, and cancer took him at 64.
So I will continue to drink my two bottles of red on Fridays and Saturdays (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is used This is an old news that the Cancer Council deliberately ignored.
What is not related to today's cancer risk???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurrent topic for many years.
Refuses to run when you could run and reciprocally.
Completely agreed.
Whiting is Bernie's blessed yes.
To them two, they destroyed the F1 under the pretext of security.
Let's hope he's better off than Schumi or even worse Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely in agreement with you, but attention to point number 1: it is not the F1, but the circuit boards who refused to advance the departure in order not to miss the TV channels.
Absolutely accurate, +1
I just wish Jules Bianchi a quick and quick recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that almost occurred between cranes of depanning and f1 were free warnings.
We knew that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, said it for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the FIA allow these manoeuvres without getting out of safety because?
I cannot accept invoking the risks of the profession or the fault at no chance when we have not prevented the predictable.
But that accident was the case.
However, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which does not only mean "forbidding to cross in the area" but has the primary purpose of signalling a danger.
It's not ashamed, it's fortunately for the family that had to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just raise their foot.
In changing conditions, the turn can be much more sturdy the turn after and the pilot, who believes to arrive with enough margin, can even have a "reduced" speed compared to a normal pace.
But well, we cause in the vacuum there, until we have seen the images, we can't make a statement.
I don't see what this changes.
Is there any wounded?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happened, which makes me ask what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there's still jobs where we have to be guards 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals such as bears, laundry rats, etc.
I hope it's ironic.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and the Toronto agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In Saskatchewan's countryside, trains do not diverge as delightful and these types of trains often cross urbanly populated areas.
Almost every city of Canada is crossed by a railway line, and trains travel very often in one day.
Moreover, as the trails often follow the rivers in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass in densely populated places, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city because it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a huge potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a reportage on this last night, really shocking.
Of course, did you not read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you have part of the reason.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
In other words, when the railways were built, they passed through the center of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the Canadian National Railway Society are expected to visit the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada, December 2-3, 2014.
CN employees are well trained in the transportation of dangerous products.
This article, as many comments make the impasse on the primary religious issue: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truth.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only strengthens this fact, otherwise what is good to distract from the sex of angels?
"God said it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word of a leader (Muslim countries but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to hold the people?"
In other words: obey the pastor to take rabbin imam and do your prayers, it will be better!
Reported below, (Nowak): pb settled in 1905 after 40 years of cures struggle.
May His Appendice Nozzle touch you.
Yes, that is what Voltaire and others thought, of which Robespierre in some way by trying to establish a worship of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather palost at the moment ) or that of the free market ( passibly supported by the state when you need to refloat ) , etc .
Great ideas from religious surgeries.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is at the trailer and expresses itself in schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and the gods put to the service of ambitions even though it also carried forms of contestation.
The twisted theology between loyalty to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time does not know the doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the consideration of these texts that are filled with explicit appesl to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Rather, moderate religious (and, fortunately, the most many) "read the texts badly" and retain only what is covered by humanism and values common to all humanity, different atheists and believers.
For me, fanatism is the stupid and evil application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Coran calling for the killing of "blessings", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a legitimate defence situation.
on Yves Petit:" about the "foulard", this is a religious prescription that today makes almost unanimity among the "fores".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from this is that it caused a general conviction.
Especially in Australia.
Are you not guilty of the same damage as the one shown in the clip?
Band of neandertalians overpayed and hypersexualized.

What did they frankly bring us apart from having drove us with the neighbors, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Les Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmania and this sataned Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, this is what they gave us!
If you take your eyes off the TV for a while, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and stones made by its native peoples and which are still source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers like Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films like The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
I should like to make another point.

Almost all of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire were civilians of Donbass who were victims of military bombings due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without dare go to explicitly designating separatists is in the Ottoman line of the World which does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the good pro-European neonazis who bravely face the wicked Russians

If I understand your speech the wicked are the Ukrainians and the nice Russian stalines you wouldn't be a little communist by chance
Extraction from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This ticket is absolutely not intended to say that Pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?

Of the Ukrainian army (he unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Any uncontrolled elements (reasonable to say anything)?
ALLEEEET ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
In other words, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place who has not ceased to denigrate Romanian football to the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the Coperativa, which decided before the beginning of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be released, and which was bleaching money at his will, mainly by selling players that were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (approximately one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was badly advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have been worth him a sentence without punishment), and therefore took three and a half years in prison.
The trial also took place in prison to the brothers Becali, four club owners, the Steaua Mihai Stoica manager, and Popescu, for football-related offences.
George Becali also takes a sentence for trying to sew (and then hiding the facts) a team so that she can beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the championship, to win the title and win the jackpot of the League of Champions.
The team he tried to sweep was our neighbors of Cluj, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be Cluj's first champions, while they were resigned.
I always enjoy this moment.
In dissimulation of this attempt to corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document suggesting that the money that the police had confiscated to Cluj was related to a land sale.
So this poor untrained, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and never do it.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist idiots today.
You might think that after the last time they broke chairs in the stadium and shop windows, and where they branded racist stripes in the streets they could not have had tickets this time, but not.

"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should employment level generalize the control of unemployed in early 2015?
I hope that in the fountain, the tax pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the gougnafiers commonly called ploutocrates, banksters, kleptocrates, tax escapes, theft bosses, and other malandrins.
You know how to make a sentence without the words banksters or ploutocrates?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
It's true when you're in class, you're treating the population with ante and no teeth.
In each new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who most often don't even have a receipt statement, he was automated.
This is also the total lack of follow-up or support from the Employment Pole.
In conclusion, I would add that the "socialist" patrony of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read an article of the chained duck here?
It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means.
It is learned that checks have allowed the removal of persons who for more than half had no longer benefit from unemployment benefits.
So we wonder how we can control people we never see.
It is wondering what a penalty is for a person who has no access to employment centre services or unemployment allowances.
And if one can admit that this reform will allow more radiation, one wonders how it will help recruiting.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means."
We must ask ourselves why these countries are in the EU, while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals.
Isn't it as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in foot, too?
Should we chase them from the EU?
The EU was only an economic origin and should remain.
The aim is not to be a "police of thoughts".
The EU is a pacifist project.
It has no sense in economic terms.
This is probably the reason why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most inequal society in Europe.
What equality???
The teams of Eastern Europe are constantly being held by the arbitrators of the corrupted mafia, the UEFA.
The best solution would be that the entire East leave this lucrative organization ruined and created its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism cruise is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, it's not true.
The currency and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
So what the hell does Europe do to let the United Kingdom enter?
Uefa should applaud them for having displayed Blatter's and her men's comedy.
This has been happening everywhere for a few years, and I don't exaggerate.
Shooted from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would it be hoped to see some small symmetrical phrases, just history of maintaining the polemic?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there has been, there are and there will be people working to throw oil on fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israelians, and that this alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would be to say that to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, action should be taken against the Israeli super-armed occupying State as a colonizing oppressor
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine at the expense of an Arab population that was for nothing in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavaria of its German inhabitants (which they were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the survivors.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr., let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
It is obvious that Morocco is the colonialist!
But, as for Israel, we also need to question history, its allies and its support to see truths.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
So stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule has been colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulies or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination based on origin.
Moreover, the Israeli State defines itself as that of a "Jewish people" of which no non-Jewish can be part of.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jewish, which is why the dispute.
Conclusion: In order to resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break with the sionism that is opposed to Jews and non-Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that we must stop ignoring.
First of all, the European Zionist project (colonizing-own Palestine) implied deposing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution requires a break with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay missed biting from the outset.
Their thorny result will give them what bites their fingers.
He should start his rehabilitation with small snakes.
I hope he didn't lose the appetite of the game.
There are so many fools tolerated, including racial insults and physically hard tails in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I would like to see him return to England, no matter what purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molarisers.
Football is a contact sport where the tacles exist and yes, therefore, players will be hurt.
The fact that your teeth come back into the flesh of an opponent to have the advantage certainly does not have its place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 games for doing a similar gesture.
It's the third time Suarez's doing this.
If you bit someone at work.
What are the consequences in your opinion?
I knew someone was gonna bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm a little dyslexic.
I forgive this two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to playing back full teeth.
All these words games on Suarez are losing their biting.
I almost bite to the hat.
A prerequisite for a good school course is the respect of students for their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents inculcate this respect to their children.
Parents make it easier for them to feel respected by teachers and their children's school.
In the good institutions, those who advance their ages are considered partners, not emm..
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do the whole job (educate, educate, learn respect, limits, live together shortly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the taf.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Mixing on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
Therefore, the action will remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational solutions reside there.
Should the actors (professors, hierarchies and ministry) play their role in this process and do not always emerge.
We can dissolve a bunch that is decaying to revive it, not the families.
How not talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for the change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the first role of the school.
Transmit knowledge.
And if there's a requirement for parents, it's the school to provide the education of their children.
What's the Minister who dares to restore what was called the Public Instructions.
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect a smart comment on this outskirts of the eastern suburbs?
It's a buff, it's clear, but I think it's rather from Willoughby, and so it's from the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
It's not surprising that we have a budgetary emergency.
Let it go and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
exactly true
That's right.
A son of Aloysius.
His electorate is Sydney North's seat.
Effectively a beap on the North Coast !!!
Well, if British BBC viewers would like to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
It goes for a sparkling, today. :(
Yeah, but his leader keeps him on a regular hunger.
You would be rather grinky, too, if you woke up one morning and realised that you will never have the Prime Minister's role and that all these legal and illegal benefits of life will remain out of your reach forever.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He half tried to present a budget and then abandoned.
At least he doesn't threaten to hit anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a far-reaching country and demand state aid.
And as she knows about lobbying, no fears about the result.
And so much for the employment in France which it has nothing to do, it comes from legumes always ready to break when their company has losses on the markets, in particular external...
It is precisely because their lobbying did not work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or an adjustment for Marpol, no doubt the project would have been completed.
After, to know if it's good or not and how BF's going to comply with the law anyway, it would be nice if "the world" was thinking about it!
The Brittany Ferries company is owned by Breton legumes.
Those who burn tax and security centres.
They want State aid.
That they didn't seem to me normal at least.
Well, as an armed ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes, it is normal to wait for a coup d'inch from the state.
Or then we are condemned to tolerate that the British monopolise the market.
It's the choice.
Jehovah's French problem that sees its maritime façades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-term desire.
One of the reasons why Brittany must regain its sovereignty.
That is what they will create the Breton flag with crews exclusively made up of pure stem bretones.
With this, it's certain they're going to make the cost decrease significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, this is what we are expecting from the BBC now.
They always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which was always closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they do not almost mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "hate all that relates to the prog" because they just broadcast an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a movie about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
With regard to Hackett's solo career, which would be "more close to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s", I disagree.
Hackett has no longer the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he had various degrees of participation and pretend to have a affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to gather a bunch of half-finished demos and call it an album of Pink Floyd.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett wants nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely great, and completely in the spirit of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they had not had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I have still not seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a just as interesting story but lack the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would still say that the BBC has "everything" hated the fact that it ADORAIT progressive music in time.
A person with personal interest screams "prejudicial": of course.
A bit more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Chanson absolutely beautiful.
If the death penalty is an attempt to replicate a terrible act by another terrible act (including sometimes against innocent people), then it is a brilliant success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his false understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so since the most just and wise vision and reflection of a society.
That means they don't have any excuses.
They're indefense.
Yes, we had understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
The common spirit of the mortals must be well disputed in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has done since his fake hearing of things.
But that is also what pain, hatred, vindicts among the loved ones of the innocent victim: a false hearing of which those who wisely decide on the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their footing will never be able to prevail.
But to try to balance the analysis, it could be argued that the condemned to death, often, has carried out wild violence, which he could have enjoyed, against people of land friendly, who paid free of charge.
The loved ones of these unfortunate victims may see their pain mitigated by the disappearance of the person who was the drunk, sometimes the torturer, of being loved and who hunts their nights.
Let us not disregard their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this reflection that I find very right.
Strong and touching article.
As far as Marc Asnin is concerned, he is very intelligent.
The one of the heart.
That's probably what I've read more just for a long time.
However, one would seem to read stories of another time, old things, that the barbarism of the past would excuse, and then these are the dates that cling, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so great.
Same for the other two "Excellent American Romans" quoted here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overwhelmed.
I thought you stopped the white, man.
What's the matter?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is incredibly better than that painful Bellow, who received the prize for him.
Perhaps the Nobel judges of this year have decided that if we have to have an American winner, we could also have a [light] racist.
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "Génial Romans" as if it was a literary genre.
His homonym Joseph, on the other hand...
Which one have you read?
How many books did DeLillo read the anti-DeLillo?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White noise?
The first lighter, crazy, smaller novels and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll end up underworld one day.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and read enough books from DeLillo to reject his talent as a writer, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's just an interest.
It was a sense of humour, "the law," not a request for definition.
Between the text and the mind, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in His sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term "conflict" comes to do.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope it will be very expensive!
Well, the state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him of danger.
After that we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only looking for tranquility.
The flooding areas that become constructive from day to day when a large construction program is going to start, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We have been told that "today there are no floods through the regulatory dams".
Now, you need to enlarge the retention lakes upstairs and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
By field.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clearer here, the interest?
Get out of the calculator and you're going to dream of the life you could have in place of Mrs. Babin, First Deputy UMP of La Fesse on the Sea and former President of the Urban Commission, who grants the permits to build!
The two mammals of the triumphing Sarkozysm are old and real estate.
I'm from the left and not at all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, no low political or low shots all azimuts, we're not in there in a battle of stinking balls.
I wonder if the police involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a messed up hole.
So what shit are you living in?
The United States isn't a mess.
Yeah, American cops are hardened because of the raids they're dealing with every day.
Of course, none of them never do anything but the cops "come to fuck them because they're racist."
Here's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is needed to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know it here.
Good cops have to report corrupt racist cops.
Come on!
Make the calculation.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've been taking part in a conversation?
It is not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it is you who do not understand anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (it is not ointment speculation).
It is highly likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension there is about it at the moment.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street funds the NYPD in different ways, so the treatment that Occupy had in there.
What surprises me is the naiveness of some and shocks me the false naiveness of VA and others.
And where do you think the journalists d'nvestigation will find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate the responsible, make them talk, build confidence.
That man goes to Elysée really has nothing surprising.
Then, what matters is the matching, checking, analysis.
And then we understand that the sarcolaistas have to worry about.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-Sarkozysm based on all coins (a non-site and no condemnation) that appear to have been concocted by judges(2 referrals in correction), two Dutch-friendly journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executives and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and unguided !!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is indignant!
From the extract I could read, the VA article only drains the drill.
I even laughed so much.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chances of coming to an end because the journalists are not "astrous" to the secret of the sources, is it?
The difference is that there does not seem to be a connivence between VA and power while there seems to be a connivence between the power and the journalists of the world for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the world on the bottom and on its dangerous relationships.
We are well facing a state scandal that in any other democracy would lead to the fall of the government involved.
That is why this editorial to the abyss, which says a long time on complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right issue, it's more serious.
I would have thought that the shrimp would be good with the smoked herring! <*)))))
It is simply for the numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about the issue of immigration, but that is not a reason to resist controls.
One of the most intelligent people in a BBC immigration program was a second generation Sikh who said that she was comfortable with the number of people who entered and the changes they brought with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperating, even refusing to give soups simply because of the woman's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship, although she said he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she was NOT comfortable"
As we all know, if we let it happen, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a pub director:) So good for you!
No more to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country was more left, it would be communist.
What did New Labour do, which is particularly left?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS is repeatedly NHS, the massive immigration of immigrants (by their own terms to fill the nose of the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-east-permission, the politically correct one that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a left centre and not a communist, I said that to joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you is specific examples of Gaustic policy, or a left-wing program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do this?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he said the New Labour was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked.
Yeah, it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director of the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with the situation of economic migrants who come to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do that.
France to French!
We beat him in 40 45 to fall into another disctature, that of money.
We're gonna make great savings with these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the Treaties, they will tell me.
Either, let's renegotiate and if the word "democracy" has another meaning in Europe, should that not?
Curiously, the Commission does not consider unfair tax competition between countries with respect to companies.
This must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, that is the problem...
The EU's objective is to make the rail transport sector fully marketed.
In terms, this means that whole parts of the French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only be strengthened.
I do not think it would be a good idea to sacrifice anything, including to make it a country, in the name of the liberal doxa.
The EU is a real problem that one day will have to be addressed well.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the accounts of the SNCF.
The French State has resigned for a long time.
The regions feel like paying for nothing, but not how to compel the SNcf to comply with its commitments.
Or use public money without waste, it is essential today when public resources are constrained.
And the huge needs.
I don't know exactly what the TER competition could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be a lobster boss?
It seems to me that you have not really succeeded in distinguishing the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, of course, still going through pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
In other words, it would seem sense to start the process of separation between your life and the complications you inherited.
Looks like that's what they're doing, but it sounds hostile.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new people come up, have you thought about a "leaking plan" so that you can cut your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be solved.
It looks windy and persistent.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and provide support to help it resume work and pay food pensions.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not hold his appointments.
Try for them to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own anger because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loving you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuous relationship between father and child, they will know who to thank when they get bigger.
I believe that children finally understand who is guilty, if they are to be shown by themselves.
Go another little effort you are close to Godwin point.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot against the pot of iron.
In addition, with globalization, the country that does the least so-called social, fiscal but also environmentally has a competitive advantage, and others are forced to follow.
All policies are looking for is growth, growth.
There would be international coordination, but by then ...
It is not the climateosceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who warms up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or car, those who live in housing that it had to build, those who bought industrial products that it had to produce and transport.
It is not the climateosceptics who manifested against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate-sceptical and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climateosceptics are more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be sufficient.
Policy action is also needed (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivity of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise made by McArtur on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only made the expression resumed.
But well it may be humour to say that the expression is Terminator.
"GHGs are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but every good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it is.
No one knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How long before someone blames immigration?
I'm making the mistake on the crap that took all the money.
Are we counting the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm claiming my $5.
I blame the liars of Democrats.
Or the democracies.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The movement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or aircraft to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Sex with monkeys is better?
You think it's a virus?
I don't advise you to ask for a prescription for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola to Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Damn it!
Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic pools, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (don't forget your wool and hat, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heating and eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be so stupid.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is this a (wrong) joke or is it not done intentionally?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a small minority of individuals to spend good time in space to make galipets and snuck while playing clowns in front of TV cameras.
TV reality has therefore not invented anything and the authorities are probably waiting for a baby to be designed up there to burn the world and enjoy the media coverage of Western royalties used to tabloids' motherhoods.
They may have to come back on the ground to see that we work here!
Unlike what you seem to believe, we don't send men or women into space to make galipets or clowns, but to work.
And these works are very useful for humanity in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily life are from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
Can you quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research?
It's just a money buck.
the ball pen that works the tip in the air (for example, to write to the ceiling)
To pay for his salaries?
To participate in the manufacture of a third unnecessary product?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and represents the vacuum itself.
Oh, if the last high tech game.
Behind the small minority of individuals who go into space, there are several dozens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to transport the cargo to the station.
If you think you're buying a plastic gun...
But, and those who don't think to buy a plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
They may be the most dangerous of all.
No, because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mislead people to make them believe it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article would have hurt the author/editor only to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even being curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) was on it?
Bad typical reportage, it is said that "it's just a plastic sword" and not the inspiring jihad text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, and terrorist groups who seek to drop governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing about the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be mortal.
Even the small coverts that are given in the fast restaurants can penetrate the meat.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculous thing the author gives it.
No need to try to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you have stated in fact support his argument.
I saw these decorative objects occasionally in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it's all his sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I love the conclusion very much.
All wonderful innovations, often technological, give many people the thought that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a distributed cost (abonnement, electricity consumption) that weighs in the budgets.
And the impossibility to benefit from new technologies causes frustration.
For example, make use of the Solidarity Energy Pact, which enables the insulating of a house for 1 € symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are actually borne by energy suppliers!).
Simple efficient but unknown even if more than 3,000 houses have been so isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can call and how it works?
For information, 60 million consumers test water-saving showers and recommend placing water-saving equipment on robinets and toilets.
The study shows that a 4-person family can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 per year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a demand crisis, it is a system crisis that no longer produces enough surpluses (which it would then have redistributed in the form of real income increases) so that these surpluses pay for the increase in expenditures that you classify as "restricted expenditures".
In other words, energy precariousness is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy is no longer able to grow as quickly as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classic theory of the economy is completely unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no inherent limit to economic growth, and there are no elements that are likely to force the pace of economic growth, more and more strongly over the decade.
By its definition itself (in physics), energy is what enables to achieve any physical transformation.
Since producing, basically, it is transforming, energy is that allows to achieve the least economic production (well or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any pressure to increase on energy generation (unjustly called "energy production"), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forced production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precariousness and the fact that it is possible, or not, to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the very formally published data, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only be resolved by increasing in the coming years and decades (the IEA, in recent reports, clearly indicates that the peak of conventional oil production, understanding, cheap oil was reached in 2008.
However, oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so it equals things.
Take this to France!
Vote No on 18.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As noted earlier, it's good to win.
It's good to win.
Yes, good work, guys.
Although many English people like to laugh at the Scottish when they just lose, there's nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get qualified, at least until they get rid of the first round.
It's even more laughing if you play against them ;)
I'm starting to worry about England.
Because now that the "gold shige generation" is withdrawn, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the XIs, why change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was "international class," is David Beckham, a little shy, perhaps, but I think if he had a pot of overweight pot as me, he would completely crash me.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, talking about the athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never care about the Scots.
I tend to be surprised to observe their hot colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class", is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that at his best times he was a very good player.
It's certain Juppe would have been bad to ask for 100000 euros for a conference in South Core.
And not sure he'd get them if he asked them...
You mean people's coming to laugh a good shot?
For the rest, I'd be surprised to hear that B Debre, for example, lives only on his compensations...
I am particularly wondering what he can tell in his lectures.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of a scientific discipline, at any scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for any sum.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is constructive.
Researchers' conferences are even paying by the lab!!!
That's to say...
Everything's lighting for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the Ethics of the UMP
I feel like she's being accused of winning money???
I am far from being one of his fans, but, that he is accused of hurting (or fraudulently) to manage his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be a completely legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remind you that its travels are handled by taxpayers.
Rule 1 of epidemiology: isolation.
All American and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection will politicians rely on making the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I can see them ban all flights and boats towards the United Kingdom.
We would always have to send goods like this...
What a shame that the panic of international media about Ebola is not more used to talk about less dramatic but more fatal health crises affecting the inhabitants of West Africa.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's a journalistic article so sad, a big title so weak.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
So smarter comments could have been made on how, why and where we can all help to better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches, and differences in the role of gender that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's go, think and write, we're not just making noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation in the same rank as decapitation - a form of just as barbaric terrorism, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case, of course, it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who thought that the Guardian was "mowing" as a global resource of journalism - progressing in the 21st century, delaying his founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, lets that appear?
For a territorial or other elected person, the money does not count.
I constantly read that the territorial public service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
This would be legitimate , indeed .
There will probably be lies and truths, to separate the right grain from the ivory.
The Court of Auditors is costly to tell so many economic problems.
It's true that they never had anything to do with people on Cambon Street.
CTs are not in deficit they have funding needs that can only relate to and only the investments they make.
Forced to use too vague concepts in the press as the World plays all the obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-employment of staff (for example, to make beautiful roundpoints) poses an increasing and incompressible burden (obligatory burden until their deaths, since lifetime work + retirement), these communities are increasing in investment.
The staffing status must therefore be abolished prior to the reduction in staffing.
And also make the mayors financially responsible.
It is fabulous, the intercommunities should have been accompanied by a decrease in the community's workforce and it is the opposite that occurs, proof that adding one level is not effective without the removal of the others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse when these territories were created is over, perhaps it would be time to react.
No, they would prefer to remain imprisoned, worse enclosed, in the administrative fabric, would he seem!
Let's even try garroted, It's not too strong to explain the blockage situation to which the state of the Vee led with its providential men.
This really started with Pétain.
Then then continued to lead to the series "at the end of the breath" that arrived strongly about it.
Why aren't they going to live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a movie to leave all that suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the type "it's the fault of the whites".
"Responses" not "Responses"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
That was in my previous post, in case it wasn't clear enough.
This is what happens when you hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make.
It is now agreed that the modern Homo Sapians evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a period of particularly wet about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to hold the way.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resignation!
2017:Transformation into a comfortable special hotel of golden closets for future retired people from the Republic?
Move the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a three-speed medicine.
We're going to save money, and the soldiers are going to cure the little one's flu elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients sound from civilians, from all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I have compassion for their fans based in Wycombe/London.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They abandoned the "London" last season.
It's just the "wasps" now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the opposite.
In addition, travels outside for the Tigers and the Holy will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the chance to be bought by the Sale Sharks, and we finally rented our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they have access to other premises, has not done us any favor.
I love to support Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of supporters and who until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent problems of the CCFC, but this must be a good bucket.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it except a few Wasps fans at work.
They and a few thousands of other people in the Southeast will probably follow them far away, or will they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But then, why aren't all computer systems based on these concepts???
+because there is a huge mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magical ++ rod....
And because for most computer systems, bugs are not really important, what matters is to be the first in the segment.
The work of G.
Berry concerns a need for niche.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
Such characters, which work for the good of humanity, should be continually (medias).
For children.
I know.
Professor (retired) Mr Noêl Dejean de la Bâtie.
The former director of law and political sciences has Rennes Mr. François Chauvin.
Professor Hugues Chabriat and his entire team of researchers.
Miss Isabelle Le Ber Chercheuse and her entire team have the ‘INSERM.
Mr Jacques Le BER , brilliant informatician.
Ms. Maîti Girtanner Concertist (Piano) Professor of Philosophy, Medal of Resistance, Great Cross of Honour Legion.
Mrs. Hermine Venot Focké.
But these don't sell.
Real-time computer has become a key sector in many areas, and few people know the intimate details of this process.
I haven't been in a Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio decreased.
I'm sorry for those who're going to lose their job, but it's better than close the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There's too much salt in our diets.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
Looks like they're reasoning with Let's make more profits, and don't let's make healthyr meals and the best price-quality ratio.
They think we're pigeons.
Oh, yeah, be careful that people don't have too much gressin.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add a little sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to the water of pasta is negligible, but it significantly reduces the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way the pasta cooks.
The finished product is so better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to business cooking.
Are there family restaurants and are they offering tasty meals at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal work accident that turned wrong.
A young promising, thief apprentice, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man has lost everything and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
That he is sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
Absolutely agree!
What a humor!
The desire to dissolve is obvious and hardly apologisable and blameable at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to dissolve is hardly apologisable.
That's why I have some sympathy for a 15-year-old child.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he never would see his son again, but without asking for forgiveness to the relatives of the guy he killed himself.
Who's really a victim in this story?
What are you going to mix all!!!?
The boy's father was convicted of what he did.
With regard to the mess of lost bullets, the accused and guilty, was well aware that the bullets were dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
10 years, that's a bit much in my opinion.
To have had the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
Indeed, it made noise!
If the opportunity is present, go on holidays in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
I have done it twice, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it's even better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
Remarkably important, German vineyards traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different grapes, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the region of the Moselle that should be recommended - Franconie, the Rhenian Palatinat (Palatinate), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is the Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are of German style (or perhaps it is the opposite, in short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottles at the property are so complex, softness is superbly balanced.
Try the Spatlese of Schloss Vollrad with a thermidor lobster next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a good guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers from the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a recap of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article about German wines that are coming, the new dryers of Baden that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly powerful, but above all, they are not those love-woman milks that people were drinking when they were young (but I really don't think it's always true or evocative, unless I'm addressed to over 40 years old - who, as I say, have already seen all this).
Close the Val de grâce would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the miserable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a spoon in the foot of my grandfather and my grandfather who studied it.
In democracy, public health management should be put to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these cabinets of ministries held by the barbichette, and those decisions taken in closed house, have become intolerant.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in the Green Sun: euthanasia at the age of 70.
Moreover, meat that will feed our poor assets (sic) could be sold as they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find a job for our unemployed, a real job, and you will no longer have any deficit problems!
For older people, it has come the time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
As a result of the disappearance, the assets cannot be held alone in this demographic transition...
So of geriatrics, yes, but to think differently than a hospital model of the glorious 30.
From now on, the maximum growth to 1.5% (it has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: some rigor and discipline that we know more in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we're really fucked up.
First we fucked because the rest of the hospitals aren't fit.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are treated elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more in increasing public service supply in other hospitals than in maintaining two-speed medicines.
The Val is a French medical excellence centre, and of course a symbol.
Closed it would be a mistake, a sign of more progress towards France's poorness.
Without mentioning the military status, which must be absolutely preserved.
"The Hospital Day Prize", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at his home.
In almost all countries of the world, a child born in that country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born of Australian residents of citizens.
But Australia is criticized because it does not meet some remarkablely high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to be two weights two measurements.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecution and ill-treatment and war that make people flee from their country and force them to come to seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that creates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, dozens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what's going on during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returns to normal.
Everything makes sense now, Nimrod!
It's weird that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little supermarket when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron declared the war crimes and abuse that were still taking place.
Since then, several European countries have suspended the deportations of Tamouls with links with the LTTE, thinking that they would be at risk of torture when they returned.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that people with LTTE relationships be considered at risk when they return.
The year [2013] has seen an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups on Hindu and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Señor Nowak, get the ha ido el coco con tanto periodico.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been treated.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pays for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah ah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Only a few years ago, we were told that the ebola kills so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is all a scientific literature on this issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of infection of the people returned was zero.
Crazy, the more we reassure, the more scared I am.
You need to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low or even weak, but not bad.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, the more a virus is mortal quickly (in general) the less likely to spread because the death of the host signs its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs from the so-called Spanish flu.
After it is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
Is there not something obscene to make media highlights of Western people, indeed brave and virtueous, but at the expense of thousands of other African patients whose profession, braveness, or virtues are not known?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but the repetition of advertisements is a terrifying parity.
Freedom of expression, so loved by the Conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, arms brothers who attacked Australian freedom of expression and the right to privacy.
I bet they had never imagined that their conservative inclinations would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need at the moment, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A warming tower for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott's refusal to participate in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Finish Market Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, would probably only be a black emergency fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope the Australian voters can see this excellent noise for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Financial Contracts Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for patients, a loss for older people and a loss for people with low income.
It may be very intelligent, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "Liaring rongeur" and its Telstra Finish Market Fund were excellent guardians for him.
If it's not fair, then show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell to the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noted it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only it could discourage her from maintaining a buzz on her constantly..
The worst destiny for a policy at the end of the career: not to be recognized in the street.
Hello She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as adequate to administer it.
How good is the "provincial" sense!
We're in a bad time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course, I am against the port of the burqa, but that is not the question.
What this anecdote tells is sarcozism in the pure state: small little ones with ministerial ranks, a confusion between the government and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tone on every access to the road to show that he is well guardian of the public order), grossity and obsoleteness carried to their maximum degree.
I propose that Morano, Sarkozy and all those "old personalities" be given the right to wear a firearm and a badge, so they would have all the freedom to exercise their self-proclaimed office as prosecutors.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets embarrassing for him.
I envy this agent who didn't know Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
similar to bob, for the time being
No agreement, thanks to her we're laughing well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, you should invent it!
It's easy, however, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blond peruk.
On this occasion, N.
Morano clearly did in the actual disgrace, in the disgrace of the police officer she had in front of her, and who probably should have multiplied the curves and "Yes, of course, ma'am, right away, ma'am, tell me, ma'am, what direction must I run to catch me without waiting for this sailed woman."
"In one of the cases, Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans aren't bad about that, but I still think Isis is going to cross them or have already done so, in Iraq at least someone counted the bodies now nobody does.
With regard to civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing rivals with the West War Machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-westers) between the two Iraqi wars would have cost lives to millions of Iraqi people, especially children, elderly people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew preferred the sanctions rather than the deprivation of the "war machine".
Was you also the kind of guy who preferred the sanctions to the order and the men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has acted in an unbelievably hard and unreasonable way in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach elite - probably a reason why they have the so-called Security Council's occasional approval.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time to mark their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission QG that they had built only five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
As brutal and hard as this bombing is, I was surprised by the shock of people knowing that a United Nations mission has been targeted like this.
Good note, I had actually forgotten that.
So, add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to people that they intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument just to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under the age of 5 and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors to see the facts.
Of course, it was in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimates that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in less than five years of age was approximately 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course, it must be feared, but also the gift of gamets in general.
You must stop pretending that people were pure minds, that love was all that the children needed, and that they could be done with strangers that neither the parent nor the child might never know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of French are genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of pretending it was obvious and using fantastic arguments, we should explain what serious problems may arise for a child adopted or designed with gaming gifts.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the gamets you came from, you could, in my opinion, return to them because they would not have committed any crimes.
The latest progress of the LDC (e.g., uterus greffe) is at least as controversial as a reasonablely framed PPA.
The real question seems to me to be: is the frustration of the desire for children justified these acrobs and it has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as point.
It is obvious that we must fear the GPA, what is this stupid question?
Of course, it's sad not to be able to have a child when you want it.
It's a problem I've known with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being born or becoming very disabled, contracting a serious disease, losing all of its children in an accident, etc.
Among all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It is frustration among many others.
This does not stop living.
And we can always take care of the children of the others!
In a society that no longer bears any form of frustration, where the child becomes a good consumer, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a caprice where one could use the other according to his good will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
